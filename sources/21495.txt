PREFA CE
This
book has been developed largely from
the material included in the books called
"The Medical Follies" and "The New Med
ical Follies." Many of the essays appear here
for the first time. The chapters have been
arranged so as to trace the logical evolution
of quackery from the earliest times to such
master minds as exploit public weaknesses
today through the mail and on the radio.

THE EVOLUTION
OF MEDICAL QUACKERY
"It is true that the scientific reasons for preferring one piece of
evidence to another are sometimes very strong, but they are never
strong enough to outweigh our passions, our prejudices, our in
terests . . ."—Anatole trance in the preface to "Penguin Island."
In
times of great stress, of pain or of sorrow, the human
being recants all that he may have learned of science and
of truth and resorts to incantation and to prayer. He is ready
to grasp at any cure or suggestion that may be offered to him
for the alleviation of his travail, never stopping to inquire as
to the motives of those who would heal him or as to the basis
on which their claims may rest. He is, in other words, but a
poor weak mortal, whose judgment is modified by any strong
circumstance that may chance to sway him.
Most primitive peoples explain disease as the seizure of
the body by demonic or evil influences. Obviously the cure
of disease, if the theory be accepted, rests on the conjuring
of the demon from the body. Thus arose the belief in the
healing powers of the priest craft and in the value of the
incantation or the prayer that the priest might utter. Thus,
too, came the determination of the remarkable virtues that
seem to be inherent in the laying on of hands, for the priests
and the medicine men and the healers of all types soon found
that the incantation or suggestion, accompanied by physical
contact, was far more efficacious than the simple prayer in
securing results.

FADS AND QUACKERY IN HEALING
the notion of a divine call to the work of representing heaven
on earth is not peculiar to any one age, race, religion, or
civilization. The healers of the savage tribes were convinced
that their powers came to them from a divine source. It is
not surprising to learn, as is shown later, that leaders of our
modern medical cults likewise believe themselves to be di
vinely inspired.
The human being craves miracles. Not satisfied with the
actual achievements of medical science, which are in them
selves miraculous, he searches in the realm of the unknown
for manifestations that he cannot understand. An eminent
American philosopher, P. T. Barnum, remarked that there
is born in this country one sucker every minute. This state
ment was improved by Joseph Jastrow of the University of
Wisconsin, who said that there is a crook born every hour
to take care of sixty suckers. This ratio has existed since the
beginning of time, and is not likely to change in the future
even with the birth of a great many eugenic babies.
There are three fields in which all human beings are
credulous—money, matrimony, and medicine. . Periods of
financial inflation bring thousands of lambs to be fleeced in
Wall Street; after the depression, a new group develops
ready for the next inflation. For matrimony, there is Reno.
Health once lost is regained only with great difficulty and
no medical scientist really believes in raising from the dead.
The medicine man of the savage tribe was frequently
marked by some mental or physical peculiarity, such as
hunchback, gigantic size, a powerful voice, or some similar
divergence from normality. Leaders of modern cults are also
the possessors of magnetic personalities that mark them
early in their careers as not quite usual in their habits of
thought. The healer is likely to have a great deal of that
quality that is called "it" in Hollywood.
The charlatans are not all in medicine. Regardless of the
field in which they operate, they are marked by certain
definite characteristics. They are likely to be persons of
striking appearance. They are likely to have after their
names long lists of abbreviations, constituting an alphabetical

appendage indicating the possession of degrees of knowledge
never conferred upon them by any university. Indeed, in
many instances these alphabetical combinations indicate
membership in organizations founded by the charlatan with
the sole motive of personal election to a high office, in order
that the name, the title, and the false impression may be
available. The charlatan may begin self-deluded as to the
powers which he possesses, but sooner or later he finds that
he does not have these powers. He then proceeds consciously
deluding those who follow him. Soon he has accumulated a
considerable group of persons who are convinced of his
sincerity, and he is in a blind alley from which he cannot
depart. His followers hold him to his leadership. History
records but few charlatans who voluntarily gave up their
evil ways and embarked on successful, honest careers.
The people who follow the charlatan are not all ignorant.
They include frequently some of the leaders of their com
munities. The cultist's follower is marked by excessive devo
tion to some person, idea, or thing which is pursued as an
intellectual fad. Among the leading followers of cultists of
various types have been such persons as Henry Ward
Beecher, Julia Ward Howe, and John Brown, who were
addicted to phrenology; Emerson who dabbled with the-
osophy; William James who practiced Fletcherization, and
Upton Sinclair who has been devoted to most of the strange
notions in health that have crossed the horizon in the last
twenty years. Indeed, one finds among the givers of testi
monials authors, actors, senators, congressmen, governors,
journalists, and perhaps particularly the intelligentsia,
characterized as "educated beyond their intellect."
The oldest available medical records are found in the
Edwin Smith papyrus some twelve centuries before the
Christian era. From that time until the time of the ancient
Greeks there was little available in the way of scientific
medicine. Then came the time of Hippocrates, Galen, and
Celsus, who were concerned with the observation of natural
phenomena and with the recording of the natural history
of disease. At that very time there were two schools of medi

cine in Greece, first the school of Hippocrates on the island
of Cos, from which emanated the historical texts and the
famous case reports; and second the temple of Aesculapius,
medical god of healing, at Epidaurus. The cases reported in
the Hippocratic texts refer frequently to patients who de
veloped diseases from which they died. So accurately are the
symptoms described that it is possible for a modern physician
to make a diagnosis in the light of modern knowledge. The
cases described on the pillars of the temple at Epidaurus
are, however, magical and mysterious. There is, for instance,
the record of the lady who came to the temple and asked
that she might conceive. It was granted to her, but though
a year passed no progeny came upon the scene. She returned
to the temple and again repeated her request, this time
asking, however, to have a child. This being granted to her,
she at once gave birth to a boy six years old who walked
around and congratulated his mother on her exceptional
performance. Here, obviously, is magic, the record of an
incident that never could have occurred.
In this connection it may be well to say that the Biblical
records of healing and of raising from the dead are, no
doubt, accurate accounts of incidents by eyewitnesses who
failed, however, to interpret what they saw. There are
numerous records in modern medicine of patients who lapse
into trance states and who, being recalled out of such states
by the power of suggestion, arise and go about their daily
affairs. To the modern informed physician such risings from
apparent death are not miracles, because they are perfectly
understood. To the uninformed observer of more than
nineteen hundred years ago, such an incident might well
appear to have been "a raising from the dead."
Following the time of the ancient Greeks came the period
known as the dark ages of medical science when men were
much more concerned with their souls than with their
bodies, not realizing that a healthful soul exists usually in a
healthful body. The Middle Ages saw the development of
anatomy and physiology and of a science of medicine based
on observation.

THE EVOLUTION OF MEDICAL QUACKERY
Whenever a new discovery is made in any field of science
there is always an inspired charlatan ready to capitalize the
discovery for his personal gain. When the Leyden jar was
discovered in Holland, the beginning of our knowledge of
electricity brought a prompt adaptation of this knowledge
to the cure of disease.
JOHN GRAHAM
Among the first of the charlatans to adapt electric healing
was the famous John Graham of England. His temple of
health, established in London in 1745, was devoted largely
to the promotion of the sale of his elixir of life. It is said
that there stood outside his temple a statue of Hygeia, the
mythical goddess of health, and inside the temple a statue of
Venus. One might see Hygeia for nothing, but the payment
of a shilling was necessary if one wished to see Venus. Inside
the temple was sold the elixir of life, and there also was the
famous celestial bed. The celestial bed was used primarily
for the cure of sterility. Those desiring posterity to carry on
their work could sleep one night in the bed on payment of
250 pounds. The bed was connected with electric coils. It
was placed in a room in which, rumor has it, soft music was
played, incense was sprayed about, and colored lights added
to the interest of the scene. No doubt, a pleasant time was
had by all. Graham spoke of himself as John Graham,
servant of the Lord, O.W.L. The phrase "servant of the
Lord" indicates his belief in divine inspiration. The term
"O.W.L." had nothing to do with a similar abbreviation
used during the war, indicating that a soldier was tempora
rily absent on business in Paris. It referred instead to the
words "Oh! Wonderful Love!" The phrase is reminiscent,
obviously, of the catchword of modern mental healing called
Christian Science; namely, "God is love."
Within every religious healing cult of which record can
be found, there are concepts concerning three of the funda
mental interests of mankind; namely, sex, hunger, and spirit-
ualjbeliet- Every church has its special concern with these
three interests. The Jewish belief of an earlier day had

definite rules regulating sexual relationships, many of them
founded on superstition; definite restrictions on diet, and
spiritual power on which one might lean in times of doubt
and stress. The strange healing cults which sprang up in
the United States following the Revolutionary War provided
similar principles and regulations.
In his interesting analysis of the life of Elmer Gantry,
Sinclair Lewis repeatedly indicates the intimate relationship
between sexual interest and spiritual belief. Indeed, the
phrase which Elmer so frequently repeats is that famous
citation from the speech of Robert Ingersoll having to do
with the power of love. The record of Aimee Semple Mc-
Pherson Hutton is a modern exemplification of sex appeal
in the pulpit.
MRS. MAPP
Perhaps the appearance in London in 1736 of Mrs. Mapp,
the first recorded bonesetter, is another example of leader
ship from the feminine point of view in extraordinary heal
ing. The record of Mrs. Mapp appears in an interesting
text by C. J. S. Thompson called Quacks of Old London.
The eminent lady bonesetter had a great following among
the nobility, and she did well with her peculiar medical
practice until one of her confiding patients was jerked into
"kingdom come."
PARACELSUS
In the fifteenth century there appeared in Switzerland a
strange figure, a man so important that Robert Browning
wrote an epic poem concerning him, and Schnitzler a play.
The great medical historian, Karl Sudhoff, is issuing a new
edition of his works, and many men have compiled his
biography. His father was a physician, his mother a nurse.
He called himself Paracelsus to indicate his belief that he
was the peer, if not greater than Celsus, the great Roman
physician. Knowing the value of a high sounding title, he
gradually added to his given name, which was itself no mean
mouthful, namely, Theophrastus von Hohenheim, and he
became finally Aureolus Philippus Theophrastus Bombastus

von Hohenheim ab Paracelsus. From the term "Bombastus"
comes, no doubt, our modern word "bombast," which re
ferred to the manner of speech of the charlatan.
This Paracelsus knew much about the uses of metals in
the human body. He wrote many works of a mystical
character. He traveled widely. He drew attention to the fact
that in a certain monastery in Carinthia the monks would
distract the concentration of the ailing from their ailments
by causing them to gaze on some brilliant object. He may
perhaps be, credited with having written some of the first
scientific observations on the power of suggestion.
FRANZ ANTON MESMER
The year 1778 brings to light the famous Franz Anton
Mesmer, the founder of Mesmerism or animal magnetism.
He appeared in Paris as the famous Viennese physician. Of
striking appearance and full of talent, he rapidly accumulated
a circle of friends by the magnetism of his wit, his ability
to play the piano, and his skill on the harmonica. Mesmer
developed in Paris a temple of animal magnetism. In the
center stood a large oaken tub full of bottles of water resting
on layers of powdered glass and iron filings. From each
bottle of water led a little iron rod. The patients sat in
concentric circles bound together by a cord which looped
around them and passed back to the tub. Here, obviously,
is a resemblance to the galvanic cell. The setting was such
as invariably enhanced the power of suggestion —stained
glass, dimmed lights of mysterious hue, incense sprayed
about, dark draperies, and hushed voices. Mesmer and his
associates passed about the circle pointing rods to the places
where disease was supposed to rest, or applying their own
magnetic hands directly to the bodies of patients with obsti
nate diseases. Cripples cast away their crutches, the sick
announced themselves cured of their diseases, and the
women, aroused to ecstasy, fell into convulsions in such
numbers that it was necessary to place next to the large hall
smaller places known as salles des crises or "halls of fits,"

into which they might be taken until they had recovered their
equilibrium and could be brought back to the circle.
Soon Mesmer and his associates found that certain patients
undergoing the manipulations did best when in a state
known today as a dream state or hypnotic state, in which
condition they were more suggestible. Later he tried to ex
plain how this result was accomplished. It remained for
Charcot and Moll and other students of hypnotism to bring
about a more definite understanding of this phenomenon.
Disciples of Mesmer came from far and wide to study
under his direction and, having learned the art from their
master, departed to spread the knowledge of Mesmerism or
animal magnetism throughout the world. Temples of mag
netic healing were established in many cities in France.
Some disciples came to the United States and set up in this
country their temples of healing; others traveled about
giving demonstrations in animal magnetism, predicting the
future, finding lost objects, and in other ways discrediting
the beginning of an actual scientific knowledge that its dis
coverers themselves were unable to comprehend. Out of this
atmosphere came the first great American charlatan, Elisha
Perkins.

II
ELISHA PERKINS
AND HIS WONDERFUL TRACTORS
"Because it is incompetent, the multitude will not feel its incom
petence, and will not seek or defer to the counsels of those who pos
sess the requisite capacity." —Bryce, "The American Commonwealth."
The
story of quackery is a never-ending tale: theorist after
theorist propounds new gospels of healing and passes
at last into that beyond which remains the great unsolved
problem. False prophet after false prophet arises, surrounds
himself with fanatical followers, builds himself a sort of
distinction while he lolls in the lap of luxury, and then
departs this mundane realm, leaving it a sadder if not a
wiser world. Indeed, as one reads the roll of the fakers, he
becomes well nigh convinced of the doctrine of the transmi
gration of souls. The same old stories are told in the same
old way, with only the addition of new wrinkles based on
modern discoveries; the same old green goods is wrapped up
and delivered to the yokelry, city and country bred, who
deposit their shekels in the cash drawer; the same old come-
on men sit at the feet of the master dispenser of hokum to
learn the technique, that they too may go forth in the high
ways and byways and become minor prophets in their own
right. Among the first of these was one Dr. Elisha Perkins,
student of Yale, well respected country practitioner of Nor
wich, Connecticut, inventor of the famous metallic tractors.
In 1796 electricity was much more a mystery than it is
today. Of course a young fellow named Benjamin Franklin

had done some kite-flying experiments, but no one yet
dreamed of electric trolley cars or of incandescent lights or
of the radio. Electricity was an unseen but powerful force,
understood by no one, uncontrollable, undoubtedly having
effects on metals and on human tissues. It is of such stuffs
that nostrums and quackery are made.
On January 16, 1741, there was born in Norwich, Con
necticut, a young man who, at the height of his powers, was
six feet tall, of remarkable symmetry, kindly, sympathetic,
and magnetic; who could ride sixty miles a day "without the
use of ardent spirits," and who could get along with three to
four hours' rest at night. Of such stuff are great quacks, great
evangelists, great physicians, and great men made. Un
fortunately no one has yet been able to determine whether
Elisha Perkins was merely a somewhat deluded physician
or actually a great impostor. Of his son's motives, there can,
however, be little doubt.
Elisha Perkins, after completing his study of medicine,
developed a satisfactory and competent practice. He became
a well recognized physician in every sense of those words.
Indeed, he was chairman of the Windham County Medical
Society, and one of their delegates to the meeting of the
Connecticut Medical Society in 1795. These points are
emphasized, for a strange similarity will be noted by the
persistent reader in an account of the life of one Albert
Abrams, who is dealt with later in this volume. It was as a
delegate to the meeting of the state society that Elisha
Perkins reported his discovery. The historians of the day
report that it was received "by some with doubt and caution
and by others even with contempt."
Briefly, Dr. Elisha Perkins had figured out that metallic
substances influence nerves and muscles. He noted a sudden
contraction of a muscle, if the point of a metallic instrument
came into contact with it during an operation. He observed
that pain stops when a metallic instrument is used to separate
the gum from a tooth previous to extracting the tooth. From
this he derived the view that metals might have an influence
if applied to the body externally. After experimenting with

various metals he developed the famous tractors. These con
sisted of two rods of brass and iron, about three inches long,
rounded at one end and pointed at the other. One side was
half round and the other was flat; and on the flat side was
stamped "Perkins' Patent Tractors." The little metallic de
vices were made by Perkins in a small furnace concealed in
the wall of his house by sliding panels. One was supposed to
be composed of copper, zinc and a little gold, and the other
of iron with some silver and platinum. As has been said,
they were probably just brass and iron. In any event one
authority asserts that they cost a shilling a pair to manu
facture and they sold for five guineas.
With these tractors, if one believed the claim of Dr.
Perkins, disease could be drawn from the body. In some
cases it was customary to draw the instrument from the
pained part to the extremities. In obstinate cases Dr. Perkins
suggested the necessity of friction upon the part till there
was redness with inflammation. It was important that the
tractors be drawn downward, for drawing them upward
might intensify the disease. For headache one could draw
them from the skin of the forehead to the back of the head
and down the neck, but Perkins was careful to add that "the
headache that arises from drinking to excess, it does not al
ways cure."
As has been said, the state medical society was inclined to
be somewhat skeptical of the claims of Elisha Perkins; in
deed, it was of the belief that the use of the tractors was
essentially a revival of animal magnetism, the form of
hypnotic suggestion introduced by Mesmer, and known as
Mesmerism. But Perkins was not daunted; he took his dis
covery to Philadelphia. There, as is told by Dr. Walter R.
Steiner, in an excellent study of the life of Perkins, the
Connecticut physician met with a most enthusiastic recep
tion. All the hospitals, poorhouses, and infirmaries received
him with open arms. "Diseases of the most obstinate nature,
which had baffled medical art, were removed by the metallic
tractors, and many persons of an advanced age, who had been

crippled for years with chronic rheumatism, were, in several
instances, perfectly cured."
The healing of the crippled, particularly those who cannot
walk because of rheumatism, is regularly accomplished and
cited to the point of monotony by all of the variegated forms
of faith healing. It was exactly such a case that received the
attention of Emile Coue\ autosuggestionist, on his visit to
the United States. A woman with chronic rheumatism, who
had made no effort to walk in many years, arose at the urging
of Coue and paraded across the stage of the theater, to the
terrific applause of the credulous, who had yielded one
dollar each to witness the miracle. A brief week later the
ancient cripple's weakened heart tissue succumbed to her
unusual efforts and she departed her rheumatism and her
terrestrial existence simultaneously.
Continuing with Dr. Steiner's narrative, we learn that
Congress was in session when Dr. Perkins arrived in Phila
delphia and that he took that distinguished body of thinkers
by storm. It is reported that a gentleman of Virginia sold his
plantation and took his pay for it in tractors. George Wash
ington purchased a set for the use of his family and the Chief
Justice of the United States, the Hon. Oliver Ellsworth,
gave Perkins a letter of introduction to John Marshall, his
successor. Ellsworth does not appear to have been altogether
convinced; nevertheless he wrote: "In some cases the effects
wrought are not easily ascribable to imagination, great and
delusive as is its power."
THE TESTIMONIAL
We know today the amount of reliance that is to be placed
on the testimonials of the great in matters of this kind. It
is reported that Alice Roosevelt Longworth sells her por
trait to a cold cream company for five thousand dollars. The
Honorable "Billy Mason," congressman, testified to the vir
tues of Nuxated Iron, as did also the renowned Jack Demp-
sey. When Sanatogen, a glorified cottage cheese, was making
its bow to the American public, artists, statesmen, tragedians
and litterateurs vied with one another in singing its praises.

ELISHA PERKINS AND HIS WONDERFUL TRACTORS
Alas! today this combination of casein and glycerophosphates
no longer holds forth as the magic formula that will save the
nation's great from neurasthenia! If only the public knew
that testimonials for almost anything can be bought in bun
dles of five thousand from New York firms that profit by
their purchase from derelict promoters of nostrums and by
their sales to the exploiters of new devices, our possessors
of fame and notoriety might hesitate to sell their letters of
praise.
The testimonial continues to be the basis for the promo
tion of patent medicines and every form of medical quack
ery. Somehow there is something convincing in the informa
tion that one's neighbor or that a resident of even the same
state has been cured of what ails him or her by whatever it
is that someone may be selling. Consider, for instance,
Fleischmann's yeast. It is just yeast with the qualities that
yeast possesses; namely, a slightly laxative effect and the
value inherent in vitamin B. More recently the yeast has
been irradiated so that it provides also a quantity of vitamin
D. Nevertheless, this simple mixture has been promoted
largely by the testimonial route for most of the ailments
that afflict mankind. First the testimonials used were of the
type that involved the ordinary citizenry. For instance, "Miss
Rivergrove, Nevada," who won the beauty contest in that
section, testified that she formerly had been unable to push
a baby-buggy three blocks, but that she was now able to
swim the Arizona River with one hand tied behind her be
cause she has been taking two cakes of Fleischmann's yeast
three times a day.
Alva Johnson, writer for the New York Herald Tribune,
told in the Outlook how the advertising agency that devel
oped the Fleischmann yeast testimonials used a blacksmith's
helper as the basis for one testimonial. Obviously a black
smith's helper will attract little attention in an advertise
ment. Dressed like a polo player, he stood behind the horse
in his usual position, while the advertisement read: "Promi
nent Sportsman Testifies to the Uses of Fleischmann's
Yeast."

FADS AND QUACKERY IN HEALING
More recently this type of testimonial has been discarded
by the Fleischmann Company, and in its place one sees a
bearded scientist from abroad, gazing through a microscope
and announcing the virtues of yeast as a remover of pimples
and as a promoter of health. Several of the scientists whose
names and photographs have appeared in these announce
ments have written to The Journal of the American Medical
Association complaining that they had never intended such
use of their names and portraits, but that these had been
wheedled from them by alert American advertising men
who had promised donations to the physician's favorite char
ity as a reward for a scientific statement on the subject of
yeast.
Time and again The Journal of the American Medical
Association has shown on one page the testimonial of some
citizen whose kidneys or lungs have been benefited, in his
belief, by some nostrum or patent medicine, and has shown
on the opposite page the death certificate of the same indi
vidual who apparently had died of his complaint three days
before the testimonial was published. Nevertheless, the tes
timonial continues to be a great power in convincing many
people.
Late in 1931 the Federal Trade Commission ruled that
testimonials paid for must have this fact clearly indicated
and announced the figures paid by one proprietary face
cream manufacturer to several leading citizens. Now Lucky
Strike Cigarets are advertised with the photographs of fa
mous motion picture actors and actresses and with the an
nouncement that the testimonial is not paid for. Neverthe
less, the photographs are timed to appear in association with
the release of new pictures in which the motion picture stars
are featured. That type of publicity can easily be measured
in terms of cash.

VOTED, It having been represented to the Society, that
one of their members had gleaned up from the miserable re
mains of animal magnetism, a practice of stroking with
metallic Instruments, the pained parts of human bodies, giv
ing out that such strokings will radically cure the most obsti
nate pain to which our frame is incident, causing false
reports to be propagated of the effects of such strokings,
especially where they have been performed on some public
occasions, and on men of distinction; also that an excursion
has been made abroad and a patent obtained from under the
authority of the United States, to aid such delusive quackery;
that under such auspices as membership of this Society and
the patent above mentioned, the delusion is progressing to
the Southward, which may occasion disgrace to the Society
and mischief abroad; wherefore this Society announce to the
public, that they consider all such practices as barefaced
imposition, disgraceful to the faculty, and delusive to the
ignorant; and they further direct their Secretary to cite any
member of this Society, practicing as above, before them, at
their next meeting, to answer for his conduct, and render
reasons why he should not be expelled from the Society, for
such disgraceful practices.
At a later meeting Elisha Perkins was expelled.
The excursion abroad, to which the state medical society
referred, was a project of the son of Elisha Perkins, the gen
tleman concerning whose motives we have already expressed
some doubt. Benjamin Douglas Perkins, Yale, 1794, left for
England in 1795 and established a trade in tractors, occupy
ing the house formerly occupied by the great scientist, John
Hunter. In 1798 Benjamin published a volume dealing with
the scientific aspects of his father's discovery. The book was
called "The Influence of Metallic Tractors on the Human
Body in Removing Various Painful Inflammatory Diseases,
Such as Rheumatism, Pleurisy, Some Gouty Affections, etc.,

Galvanism, or Animal Electricity, by Benjamin Douglas Per
kins, A.M., Son of the Discoverer."
In this remarkable book it is pointed out that the tractors
operated on the galvanic principle. Their virtues are at
tested by ten members of the Connecticut Medical Society
and by three physicians from other states. Nine clergymen
also tell how the tractors brought them relief, and, as Dr.
Steiner points out, one of the clergyman found "them also
useful in picking walnuts." There were also testimonials
from university professors, from governors of almshouses,
and from members of the legislature.
THE BIGGER THEY ARE THE HARDER THEY FALL
Learned persons with one-track minds can always be
found who will endorse the most ridiculous hocus-pocus in
matters of health. As is well known, the most enthusiastic
of the followers of Albert Abrams of our own day has been
one Upton Sinclair, who has at various times endorsed hall
a dozen health fads and forms of cultism. Unmindful of the
history of quackery, many physicians have expressed surprise
that men who have made superlative successes in business,
in the arts, and in the learned professions, become the vic
tims of New Thought, Christian Science, Abramsism, and
what-not. Credulity, unfortunately, is not limited to any sin
gle class. There is pride of learning and accomplishment
that is more dangerous than the most abject ignorance.
Before we proceed to the last stages of Perkinsism, how
ever, let us recount the passing of the great Elisha. Yellow
fever broke out in New York City in 1799. The period was
that dark age in medicine before the commission headed by
Walter Reed in Havana had shown that the disease is trans
mitted by the mosquito and before William Crawford Gorgas
had shown that yellow fever could be stamped from the
face of the earth by applying this knowledge. It required
the discoveries of Pasteur and the magnificent investigations
of the first quarter of the twentieth century to abolish this
pestilence. In Perkins' time yellow fever was the most dread
scourge of seaports and cities. So, when the disease broke out

in New York, Elisha thought the time right for a demon
stration of a medicinal formula which his fertile brain had
evolved. His remedy was essentially a combination of vinegar
and salt, which was administered in tablespoon doses, diluted
with three parts of hot water. For three weeks Dr. Perkins
prescribed this medicine assiduously and, as might be sur
mised, with but little success. Then he himself succumbed
to the disease and gave up the ghost on September 6, 1799.
About this time Benjamin Douglas Perkins burst forth
with another edition of his book. There appeared also a
volume which recounted certain Danish experiments with
the tractors, translated from the Danish into German and
thence into English. Not only had the Danish investigators
tested the tractors on human beings but also on horses. To
their report Benjamin Perkins added the records of one hun
dred and fifty additional English cases.
We shall see later, in discussing other cults, that the be
ginning of their decline is usually contemporaneous with
attempts to apply them to the lower animals. A horse is,
after all, a piece of property and not to be compared with a
child or a wife or any other foolish human being. Even our
government is much more ready to appropriate money for
the control of disease among pigs and cows and horses than
among human beings. Moreover, a horse never gives a tes
timonial; hence, perhaps, the term "horse sense."
It has been customary for medical leaders, viewing the
rise of Christian Science, osteopathy, and chiropractic in our
country, to sigh, almost regretfully, that the English never
fall for such things. Of course, the English did fall heavily
for homeopathy; an English committee solemnly found that
the principle underlying Abramsism might be sound, and
the leaders of British medical organizations are beginning
to worry about bone-setters, osteopaths, and spinal adjusters.
And England fell harder than any other country for "trac-
toration" as expounded by Benjamin Douglas Perkins. Tes
timonials were secured from all sorts of reverends, including
the chaplain to the Prince of Wales; Lord Henniker conde
scended to patronize the discovery and bought three pairs

of tractors. Finally, a dispensary for the poor was opened,
sponsored by a committee which included eleven vice presi
dents, and solemnly dedicated at a dinner during which odes
and poems were inflicted on those present.
Eventually one medical practitioner, John Haygarth of
Bath, assisted by Dr. Falconer, made a pair of tractors out
of wood and fixed them up to resemble the authentic speci
mens. With these they succeeded in producing what ap
peared also to be remarkable cures. They sent false speci
mens to other physicians, who forthwith reported astounding
results. Then in 1803 Perkins, who had become a Quaker,
left England with a profit of some fifty thousand dollars
from the tractor business and established himself in New
York as a publisher and bookseller. Honored and esteemed,
Benjamin Douglas Perkins died on October 13, 1810, at the
age of thirty-seven, the life expectancy of that day; by 1811
people were already speaking of "tractoration" as one of the
follies of the past.
There in brief is the story of one of the first of the great
American quacks. Dr. Walter Steiner, whose collection of
Perkinsiana is probably the most complete available, is con
vinced that Elisha himself believed in the efficiency of the
tractors but is inclined to think that Benjamin Douglas Per-,
kins was somewhat of a rascal. As we shall see later, one is
frequently at a loss to know just how far any apostle of
cultism believes in himself and in his delusion and just how
far he is willing to take the profits and a chance on the sin
cerity.

THE RISE AND FALL
OF HOMEOPATHY
Diseases are cured, not by eloquence, but by remedies well and duly
applied, of which, if any sage and discreet man, though he have no
tongue, know well the proper usage, he shall become a greater physi
cian than if, without practice, he ornament well his language.
—Cornelius Celsus (25 B.C.- 50 A.D.).
If
scientific medicine today is withstanding nonchalantly
the assaults of a myriad of systems, cults, and quackeries,
it is merely repeating the history of other periods. The
eighteenth century, for example, was predominantly a time
of revolutionary systems and theories in medicine. There
was the dynamico-organic system of Stahl, who believed that
the soul was the supreme principle of disease. There was
the mechanico-dynamic system of Hoffmann teaching that
life expresses itself in motion, and that all manifestations
within the body are controlled by nervous spirit. The school
of Montpellier taught that various organs possess individual
life. Mesmer, prince of impostors, claimed that magnetic
fluid poured from the hand, and the Brunonian system as
serted that it was only necessary for a cure to determine the
grade of disease in accordance with the strength or weak
ness of the active irritation, and to adjust the right propor
tion of strengthening or weakening medicines to the case.
Further, there remained from previous centuries phlogistic
and antiphlogistic theories, the view that all disease was
caused by the impaction of debris and obstruction of the in
testines, and half a dozen other assorted hypotheses.

FADS AND QUACKERY IN HEALING
At the end of the century scientific medicine had little of
its own to offer. Pasteur had not discovered the bacteria, Lis
ter had not given us asepsis, chemistry was only beginning
to be a science, and the other fundamental medical sciences
—anatomy, pathology, biology, and physiology—had just be
gun to sort out their facts from a welter of hypotheses. Drugs
were known in abundance, but there was nothing compar
able to the scientific pharmacology of today. All sorts of
mixtures and combinations were used without reference to
the effects that the ingredients of a mixture might have upon
one another. When a positive action was obtained it was
credited to the mixture and not to the individual ingredi
ent responsible. Such was the scene just before 1800. Upon
this stage there stepped a remarkable figure, Samuel Chris
tian Friedrich Hahnemann, born at Meissen in Germany in
»755-
EARLY YEARS OF HAHNEMANN
After studying at Leipzig and Vienna, Hahnemann gradu- .
ated in medicine at Erlangen in 1779, but he became dis
satisfied with the practice of his profession and retired for
reflection and study. In 1790 there came into his hands a
materia medica written by William Cullen of Lanarkshire.
Cullen was professor of medicine at Glasgow and Edinburgh
and founder himself of a system of medicine which empha
sized the importance of the nerves, and assumed that the
brain was indissolubly united with the soul. Cullen, how
ever, was a practical man; his therapeutics were simple and
he deplored the excessive bloodletting which was a feature
of the medicine of the time. It had already been attacked
by Le Sage in Gil Bias, by Moliere, and by many others.
Hahnemann read in the book by Cullen that Peruvian bark,
the source of quinine, would cure malaria. This was true;
quinine does cure malaria. But what did Hahnemann do
with the observation? Unfortunately, he did not know that
malaria is caused by a plasmodium which gets into the blood
through the agency of the mosquito; the plasmodium was
not discovered by Laveran until November 6, 1880. So

THE RISE AND FALL OF HOMEOPATHY
Hahnemann evolved the theory that perhaps quinine cured
malaria because it would produce symptoms like those of
malaria if given to a healthy man. He tried it on himself
and it did. With this idea fixed in his mind, he returned to
the practice of medicine in 1796, and his remarkable hypoth
esis became the basis of the system called homeopathy, ex
pressed in the phrase similia similibus curantur, "like cures
like."
This idea was not really original; it was essentially a re
vival of the old Paracelsian doctrine of signatures —like
cures like—except that Paracelsus directed his attack toward
the cause of the disease rather than at the symptoms. There
are, in fact, some who assert that Milton, in his preface to
Samson Agonistes, was alluding to the same thing as prac
ticed in his time:
{Tragedy

Aristotle to be

is,

kind

delight, stirred up
by
reading or seeing those passions well imitated. Nor is Nature
wanting in her own effort to make good his assertion: for so
in physic, things
of
melancholic hue and quality are used
against melancholy, sour against sour, salt to remove salt
humors.
The idea, therefore, was not new.
the homeopathic Organon
After his return to practice,
it
became Hahnemann's chief
interest in life to propagate his theory. He began at once to
write extensively, and
it
is
significant that he did not con
fine his propaganda to the medical profession but addressed
the public as well. Furthermore,
it
is
a
fact that he received
all students, all applicants for knowledge of his methods,
whether or not they had been previously trained in medi
cine. Then in 1810, he presented to the world the homeo
pathic bible, Organon der Rationellen Heilkunde.

presented in this book, involved three main tenets: first,
that diseases or symptoms of disease are curable by particu
lar drugs which produce similar pathologic effects upon the
healthy body; second, that the dynamic effect or force of
drugs is increased by giving them in very small doses, even
diluted to a decillionth of their original strength, and lastly,
that chronic diseases are a manifestation of a suppressed itch
or "psora."
Hahnemann seems to have known practically nothing of,
or to have been unwilling to recognize, the existence of
those definite changes in the human body that are associated
with disease, and that are now included under the science
of pathology. To him disease was chiefly a matter of the
spirit. "Diseases," he said, "will not cease to be dynamic
aberrations of our spiritlike life, manifested by sensations
and actions." This spiritual theory, in which Hahnemann
believed so implicitly, dominated subsequent homeopathic
literature. The "dynamis" not only lay at the bottom of
disease; it was also responsible for the power exerted by
drugs in working cures.
Hahnemann's theory of "psora" or itch was essentially so
preposterous that it began to be deserted even by confirmed
homeopathists almost immediately. The "psora" was a miasm
or evil spirit which pervaded the body and ultimately man
ifested itself on the surface in the form of an eruption, or as
a nodular growth, or as some other form of skin disturbance.
It was Hahnemann's idea that the outward manifestation
was a salubrious mechanism for the relief of the inner con
dition.
The Organon said:
The only really salutary treatment is that of the homeo
pathic method, according to which the totality of symptoms
of a natural disease is combated by a medicine in commen
surate doses, capable of creating in the healthy body symp
toms most similar to those of the natural disease.
Then,

accordance with the similitude of symptoms, a somewhat

stronger, similar, artificial morbid affection is implanted
upon the vital power deranged by natural disease; this arti
ficial affection is substituted, as it were, for the weaker simi
lar natural disease against which the instinctive vital force,
now only excited to stronger effort by the drug affection,
needs only to direct its increased energy; but owing to its
brief duration it will soon be overcome by the vital force,
now only excited to stronger effort by the drug affection,
needs only to direct its increased energy; but owing to its
brief duration it will soon be overcome by the vital force,
which, liberated first from the natural disease, and then from
the substituted natural disease, and then from the substi
tuted artificial (drug) affection, now again finds itself en
abled to continue the life of the organism in health.
In simpler terms, the conception was that the drugs in
duced a condition which was substituted for the actual dis
ease, and that the body could easily get rid of the substitute.
That, in brief, was the pharmacologic doctrine of homeop
athy.
PROVING A DRUG
It will be remembered that Hahnemann arrived at his
method of treatment by observing the symptoms caused by
a dose of Peruvian bark. In 1771 Albrecht von Haller had
first suggested the method of testing the virtues of drugs by
trying them on healthy human beings. The method was
revived by Hahnemann, and called "proving a drug." Not
only did medical men test drugs upon themselves under this
proving system, but all sorts of other proving tests were
made by all kinds of more or less qualified individuals. The
results, as might be expected, were remarkable. One decil-
lionth of a grain of table salt was found by an imaginative
prover to produce on himself 1,349 symptoms. And while
the dosages of the early homeopaths often reached the
heights of futility, the preparations they used were some
times of a highly poetic and romantic nature. In a catalogue
of homeopathic remedies appeared such strange substances
as lachryma filia, the tears of a young girl in great grief and
suffering, used for great grief and suffering in young girls.

Then there was flavus irides, the yellow ray of the spectrum,
there were extracts of three kind of pediculi, or lice, and
anticipating the modern gland craze, there were extracts of
all of the body glands then known. The strength of the
drugs used may be estimated from the fact that a child in
Gloucester County, Virginia, took $8 worth of homeopathic
medicine at a single sitting, the entire supply of the family
for a year, and, not knowing that anything ought to happen,
didn't have a symptom!
THE SUCCESS OF HOMEOPATHY
The physicians who were attempting to follow the waver
ing path of scientific medicine through the mass of medieval
superstitions which beset it at that time suddenly found
themselves placed on the defensive. Compared to the gen
eral medical practice of the age, the system of Hahnemann,
though quite fallacious, had two things in its favor: it re
placed mixtures of powerful drugs in large doses by small
doses of simple ones. Thus a widely used prescription was
Rush's Thunderbolt, developed by Benjamin Rush, signer
of the Declaration of Independence. It gave ten grains of
jalap and ten of calomel at a single dose. A patient who had
just tried it thereafter craved weak medicine. Moreover,
homeopathy carried with it, as any new and revolutionary
system always does, a powerful appeal to the lay imagina
tion. Professors Meyer-Steinheg of Jena and Sudhoff of Leip
zig, two of the world's greatest medical historians, assert that

for good. He emphasized the individualization of the patient
In the handling of disease, he stopped the progress oFTialf

actual virtues of drugs by trial. It is probably true that any
criticisms which might be brought against him in the light
of later and better knowledge apply equally well against a
large part of the other medicine of his time. Moreover, we
must not hold against him the vagaries and exaggerations
into which some of his disciples drifted.

THE RISE AND FALL OF HOMEOPATHY
What was the immediate success of homeopathy? In 1821,
in Leipzig, the first homeopathic journal was published, the
Archives of the Homeopathic Method of Curing Disease. In
Austria, where homeopathy appeared in 1819, it was for
bidden by an imperial decree, but it nevertheless made prog
ress and the decree was revoked in 1837. It reached Italy
and Denmark in 1821. Quinn, a physician, introduced the
method into Great Britain in 1827, but shortly thereafter
medical opposition became strong and practitioners of hom
eopathy were denied the right to practice. This prohibi
tion, after a long contest, was revoked, and by the eighties
homeopathy was prospering. A homeopathic hospital was
opened in 1887 in Liverpool on an endowment by Henry
Tate, a sugar refiner. The first homeopathic dispensary had
been opened in 1841, the second in 1867. In 1885 it was re
ported that the English dispensaries treated 78,881 patients,
or 1,516 a week. At the dedication of the hospital in 1887
a conference of homeopathic practitioners was held, and the
hope was expressed that a homeopathic surgeon would soon
arrive to take care of work referred by homeopathic prac
titioners.
HOMEOPATHY IN THE UNITED STATES
But nowhere did homeopathy flourish as it did in the
United States. It was apparently brought to this country in
1825. The first homeopathic medical college was organized
in Philadelphia in 1848, the next in New York in 1858.
About 1880 the homeopathic practitioners were at the height
of their influence. Many tales might be told of the battles
within the medical fraternity to determine whether the
homeopathic or the regular party should control. Indeed,
there are whisperings of a session of the American Medical
Association at which a phalanx of homeopathic practitioners
assaulted the platform and dragged the speakers bodily from
their perch. Homeopathic schools appeared in abundance.
In 1880 there were in the United States, 72 regular medi
cal colleges, 12 homeopathic colleges, and 6 eclectic colleges.
In 1890 there were 93 regular, 14 homeopathic, and 8 eclec

tic. In 1900 there were 121 regular, 22 homeopathic, and 10
eclectic. And in 1900 the homeopathic practitioners, assem
bled in Washington, D. C., dedicated a monument in gran
ite and bronze to: 1
Samuel Christian Frederich Hahnemann,
Dojctor in Medicine.
Hofrath
Leader in the Great Medical Reformation
Of the
Nineteenth Century
And
Founder of the
Homeopathic School.
THE DECLINE OF HOMEOPATHY
But from that year the influence of homeopathy began to
decline steadily, its schools to close their doors or to merge
with regular medical schools, and its practitioners to prac
tice in increasing measure what they called "allopathic"
medicine. What happened to bring about this remarkable
and sudden change? Undoubtedly two influences, both
brought to bear on medical education, induced the ultimate
collapse.
The first educational number of The Journal of the
American Medical Association was published on September
21, 1901. It listed the medical colleges in the United States,
the type of education and preliminary entrance require
ments enforced in each school, and its provisions for didactic
and clinical teaching. It showed that there were 124 regular
medical schools, 10 eclectic schools, and 21 homeopathic
schools, and it pointed out their qualities and their de
ficiencies. The poor schools began to wilt and fade—and
many of the homeopathic schools were poor ones. By 1905
their graduates were fewer in number than in any year
since 1880. In 1907, there were but seventeen homeopathic
schools left; in 1908, but sixteen; in 1909, fourteen; in 1912,
ten; in 1915, eight; in 1921, five; and in 1925, there re

mained but two, and one of these carried a low classification.
Altogether during 1923, there were just forty-nine homeo
pathic graduates.
At the end of 1931, homeopathic medicine continued to
be taught only in the New York Homeopathic Medical
College and Flower Hospital of New York, and in the
Hahnemann Medical College and Hospital in Philadelphia.
In the former institution 348 students were registered, and
there were 77 men and 3 women graduates. In the Philadel
phia institution there were 502 students and 93 graduates
for the year. However, in these institutions the medicine
that is taught is not homeopathic medicine in the old sense
of the word, but modern medicine with some reflection of
the history of homeopathy.
In the meantime, gatherings of homeopaths view with in
terest attempts made abroad to read into the knowledge of
the present the homeopathic theories of the past. The de
mand among young men for opportunity to study medicine
is far greater than the number of places available in Ameri
can medical schools. Hence institutions that give reliable
four-year courses are bound to be crowded with students re
gardless of any strange notions that they may teach, provided
they, at the same time, have complete qualifications in med
ical science. When the homeopathic graduate takes his place
in the community he practices regular medicine.
THE DEATH OF HOMEOPATHY
Publicity is a powerful tool. Students who observed the
gradual decline of homeopathy began to seek regular schools;
in fact, many a young man who had been doctored in his
early youth by a homeopathic physician was advised by that
very physician not to enter a homeopathic college. The fact
is,
indeed, that homeopathy died from within. The very
disciples of Hahnemann, and most of the more enlightened
practitioners of homeopathy since Hahnemann's time, when
they came into practice, found their system unavailing in the
face of serious illness. They then availed themselves of the
right of every practitioner of medicine to use any treatment

that may be for the good of his patient. They informed
themselves of scientific medicine and prescribed drugs in
doses that would work. The American Institute of Homeop
athy, the official organization, finally adopted the definition:
"A homeopathic physician is one who adds to his knowledge
of medicine a special knowledge of homeopathic thera
peutics and observes the Law of Similia. All that pertains
to the great field of medical learning is his, by tradition, by
inheritance, by right." This was essentially a desire to allow
homeopathic practitioners to prescribe "old school" drugs in
old school doses. It was a confession of inadequacy and
failure.
While homeopathy, as a school, though not the individual
homeopathist, had stood still and clung to its law of similars
and to Hahnemann's unprovable theory, scientific medicine
had been sweeping onward with steady, sure progress. Before
such a fact as the inevitable response of the heart to an ade
quate dose of digitalis, any theory of dynamics and vibra
tions which called for splitting that dose into decillionth
parts was bound to evaporate. Before the rapid effects of the
satisfactory administration of mercury and "606," measur
able by a Wassermann test, theories of "psora" and similars
could not exist. The effects of efficient dosages are, as Celsus
asserted, positive, sure, visible, convincing. They need no
argument, they speak for themselves. Thus, by 1900, all that
remained of the original homeopath was the law of similars
and the method of using them. Otherwise homeopaths were
prescribing diphtheria antitoxin and forgetting belladonna;
they were practicing surgery; they were using full doses of
drugs when they wanted to get action. It came down to
this: that a homeopath was just like any other physician,
except that he gave what were essentially nothing but place
bos in minor conditions. When the regular medical schools
began to raise their standards, the homeopathic schools had
to do the same or confess their inferiority. And when they
did the same, they lost their students, who had been
attracted chiefly by their lower standards, and had to close
their doors anyway.

THE RISE AND FALL OF HOMEOPATHY
Thus passed the homeopathic system. Thus, in fact, pass
all systems in the practice of medicine. Scientific medicine
absorbs from them that which is good, if there is any good,
and then they die. Perhaps osteopathy has taught us some
thing by its stress on massage; perhaps even Eddyism has
made itself valuable by showing the value of suggestion in
conditions affecting the mind. Others, such as chiropractic
and Abramsism, teach only the ease with which delusions
may be foisted on the public. The history of homeopathy
is distinct and peculiar. It records the propounding and
acceptance of a theory which, in itself wrong, nevertheless
influenced the steps of a beginning science into paths that
were right.

IV
THE END OF ECLECTICISM
"There is no escaping the fact that we are citizens of an age at once
the most skeptical and the most gullible in human history."
—Glenn Frank, "Thunder and Dawn."
In
books on medical history the term eclecticism has two
meanings. The first goes back to the Greeks. Following
the collection of the Hippocratic texts before the Christian
era, certain Greek physicians and scientists formed a group
of eclectics who proposed to dispense with preconceived
notions and to develop a school of scientific medicine. But
they passed, and from the period of Galen (200 a.d.) until
that of Paracelsus (1493-1541 a.d.) medicine rested in
oblivion while men gave more thought to their souls than
to their bodies, to argument than to observation, to theory
than to scientific fact.
Then came the second eclecticism. The biting sarcasm of
Paracelsus disturbed the calm belief in Galenic medicine,
and the discoveries of Vesalius in anatomy, of Harvey as to
the circulation of blood, of Jenner concerning vaccination,
and particularly of Leeuwenhoek, maker of microscopes, re
stored accurate observation to its proper leading position in
the science of medicine. But the new methods brought new
enthusiasts, and a host of new systems threatened to impede
all actual progress. Mesmerism, Brunonianism, phrenology,
homeopathy, Rademacherism, Baunscheidtism, hydropathy,
odic force, and animal magnetism contended for favor, and
scientific inquiry was neglected. The appeal of the bizarre
is strong even to enlightened men; to a public educated to

a belief in the black art, magic, alchemy, and the miracles
of the saints, the unusual necessarily had an absolute fasci
nation. Medicine in this way became inordinately complex
and chaotic.
Into this maze came Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland, whose
whole career was a protest against the confusion. To him
systems of medicine were anathema. He wanted the facts.
With the founding of his Journal of Practical Medicine in
1795 there began a battle for the scientific study of disease
that is still going on. Of him it may be said that he was truly
eclectic. And after Hufeland came Canstatt, Wunderlich,
Skoda, Rokitansky, and all those other robust German scien
tists who laid the foundations of modern medicine.
ECLECTICISM IN AMERICA
But what of American eclecticism? What relation did it
have to Hufeland and his work? And what has become of it?
Medical historians at home apparently take but little pride
in it, and foreign historians seem to be unaware of its
existence. Even the erudite Fielding H. Garrison, whose
History of Medicine is the last word in English on the sub
ject, astutely ignores this eclecticism. In what is perhaps
his only reference to it he waxes, for so calm a man, a
little acrid. "In America, under existing legislation." he
affirms, "every species of medical sect —osteopathy, chiro-
praxis, Christian Science, eclecticism, botanic medicine, etc.
—has been permitted to flourish."
In the land of the free eclecticism is thus something dif
ferent. It is a system of medicine which treats disease by the
application of single remedies to known disturbances, with
out reference to any scientific classification, but giving spe
cial attention to the development of plant remedies. It is the
apotheosis of the old grandmother and witch-doctor systems
of treatment. It arose out of the attempts of a widow to con
serve her husband's income and out of the medical practice
of an old woman herb doctor. It profited and prospered, no
doubt, by that same reaction against the drastic materia

medica of the period around the year 1800 that gave us
homeopathy.
Those were days of heavy drugging. Dr. Benjamin Rush,
signer of the Declaration, was still prescribing his "Thunder
bolt." Homeopathy owed its initial success to the fact that it
prescribed small doses of remedies in vast quantities of
water, and so did not interfere with the natural tendency of
the body to recover. On this tendency —the vis medicatrix
naturae—all of the cults of history have floated their frail
vessels. Eclecticism did so like the rest. It discarded most of
the mineral remedies of the time and emphasized the use of
the milder drugs derived from plants. It urged the use of
single remedies and, at most, of simple combinations. Since
most of the remedies it promoted have since been shown to
be quite inert or utterly inadequate in the large majority of
cases, the vogue of the cult must have rested on the same
desire to escape overdrugging that promoted homeopathy.
And it had a vogue! At the height of that vogue it graduated
several hundred physicians every year from ten medical col
leges. But gradually, as scientific medicine progressed, its
ranks dwindled, and it fell into the hands of exploiters and
promoters. Today it totters feebly in one recognized school
and in several diploma mills, it finds itself involved in
noisome licensure scandals, and it is likely to succumb
shortly to what physicians in their consultations call an
exitus lethalis.
JACOB TIDD MAKES MEDICINES
Dr. George Andrew Viesselius, born in Holland (or Ger
many) , emigrated to this country in 1749, settled in New
Jersey, married an American girl, and established a com
fortable practice. When he died in 1767 there remained on
his estate, in addition to his widow, a bound or hired boy
named Jacob Tidd. Jacob used to help the doctor out by
making up washes, salves, plasters, and similar external appli
cations according to formulas that Viesselius had brought
from abroad. The community boasted few practitioners and

widows, decided to keep the practice going with the assist
ance of Jacob Tidd. Jacob came into possession, through
this association, of the professional papers of Doctor Vies-
selius. In 1796-1800 he was in Western Pennsylvania for a
time. It is not recorded whether he served as an army doctor
or as a private soldier during the Whisky Insurrection,
although he did serve, but it is noted that he secured herb
remedies from the Indians directly and also from a relative
who had been a captive among them.
WOOSTER BEACH ONE OF THE FOUNDERS
Returning from the war, Tidd set up as a doctor at
Ringoes, New Jersey, and soon acquired a lucrative practice.
For forty years he practiced at Amwell, in Hunterdon
County, New Jersey, apparently limiting himself largely to
the external remedies that were a heritage from the old
Dutch doctor. Many persons came to him to learn his meth
ods and among them was one Wooster Beach. Beach was
born in Trumbull, Connecticut, in 1794. He educated him
self and his biographers relate that he pursued eagerly all
the adverse criticisms on the medicine of the time that came
his way. One day he heard about Jacob Tidd, and went to
him in search of instruction. "Suspicious lest his means of
livelihood would be wrested from him," says the biographer,
"he (Tidd) flatly refused to receive Beach, as he had many
others who had applied for the same privilege." Here is one
of the marks of the charlatan in medicine. The true medical
scientist has no secrets that he guards from other physicians;
his knowledge is broadcast through the medical periodicals
so that physicians everywhere may use it in alleviating the
ills of mankind.
Let us see the type of energy that inspired Beach. In a
letter he said: "I was obliged to return home disappointed.
But the same anxiety continued, and I felt, respecting my
one desire, something as the Apostle Paul is represented to
have felt respecting religion, when he said, 'A dispensation
of the gospel is committed unto me, and woe be unto me if
I preach not the gospel.'

Of such stuff are the founders of

cults made; one always finds them prating in terms of theo
logical derivation, and usually affirming their ability to
commune personally with the Deity. Again and again Beach
attempted to study with Jacob Tidd. Finally, he came at a
time when Tidd was without an assistant. Beach took the
place and remained until Tidd died at seventy-four years of
age; then he succeeded to the practice. Beach was the formu-
lator of Eclecticism —first under the name of the Reformed
Practice of Medicine.
Eventually he went to New York, to treat several cases to
which he was called in consultation. He settled there and is
said to have become belatedly a student at a medical college,
graduating in due form and becoming a member of the New
York County Medical Society. In 1825 he started teaching
and writing, attacking the use of bloodletting and strong
remedies and urging his students to treat disease with na
ture's remedies —herbs and roots. In 1827 he opened an
infirmary in Eldridge Street, New York, and in 1837 he
started the New York Medical Academy, which eventually
became the Reformed Medical College of New York, the
parent school of the eclectic system.
THE RISE OF THOMSONISM
In the meantime, the system of practice known as Thom-
sonism, later incorporated into Eclecticism, had been devel
oping independently. Samuel Thomson was born in New
Hampshire in 1769. When he was four years old he dis
covered that lobelia, or Indian tobacco (Lobelia inflata) , an
indigenous herb, if chewed, induced vomiting. He amused
himself by getting his boy friends to chew it. An old woman
herbalist in the vicinity told him more about roots and
grasses. He tried to study medicine under a root doctor
nearby, but was refused owing to his deficient education.
Then he married, went to farming, and began a family. One
of his children fell ill of scarlet fever and when the attending
physician gave up the case Thomson tried steam inhalations
and lobelia with success. Then he became a traveling herb
doctor and had his remedies patented in Washington. It will

be seen later that the rise of osteopathy hinged on the death
of one of the daughters of Andrew Still.
Eventually Thomson tried to settle down in Massachusetts,
but he was bitterly attacked by the local medical profession
as a quack. Once he was acquitted of murdering some one
with too much lobelia; after the trial he found that he had
earned sufficient popularity to encourage him to open an
office in Boston. The Thomson system of treating disease
with herbs, mostly lobelia, was taken up to some extent by
others and flourished for twenty years. Thomson died in
1843, "heroically partaking of his own remedies until the
very end." His New Guide to Health, written in 1822, passed
through many editions, and at last became Thomson's Ma
teria Medica or Botanic Family Physician. Although opposed
by Wooster Beach, who was little inclined to welcome com
petition, Thomsonism soon became incorporated into the
eclectic system.
THE SCHOOLS FOR ECLECTIC MEDICINE
On May 3, 1830, the Reformed Medical Society of New
York, founded to support the ideas and the school of Beach,
adopted a resolution to found an additional school of eclectic
medicine in some town on the Ohio River. It was hoped that
in the newly opened country better opportunity would exist
for the new school to lead an untrammeled existence. The
school was established at Worthington, Ohio, in 1833, as the
Worthington Medical College, but it did not thrive. It sus
pended its sessions in 1839. In 1843, it removed to Cin
cinnati, which is still the fountainhead of eclecticism in this
country. In 1845, it became the Eclectic Medical Institute.
By 1848, it was again in difficulties, and a convention was
called in Cincinnati to organize a national society of eclectic
practitioners. Wooster Beach's name headed the list of or
ganizers, and in 1855 the grand old man of eclecticism
became the president of his society.
In the meantime disciples of eclecticism had been spread
ing the gospel hither and thither in our fair land. Colleges
rose and fell like the flowers that bloom in the spring. The

New York Reformed Medical College, born in 1826, was
extinct about 1839. The College of Medicine, Botanic, or
ganized in New York City in 1836, died in 1846. The Eclec
tic Medical Institute of New York, created in 1847 as the
Medical School of Fredonia, moved to Rochester in 1848,
merged with the Randolph Eclectic Medical Institute, and
moved to Syracuse in 1849, becoming the Central Medical
College of New York. In 1850, it moved back to Rochester
and in 1852 it had its exitus lethalis. The Eclectic Medical
College of New York City, organized in 1866, graduated its
first class in 1867 and then sent forth one every year until
1913, when it succumbed. In the early days running a med
ical college was usually a profitable procedure, and was thus
considered an important accessory to medical practice.
So the colleges of eclectic medicine came and went. The
facts for New York were duplicated on a smaller scale in
other states, but a multiplication of examples is needless. In
1860 there were four eclectic medical colleges, and they
graduated some two hundred dispensers of plant remedies.
In 1870, there were five schools; in 1880, eight, and in 1890,
and in 1900, nine. Shortly after this time the Council on
Medical Education of the American Medical Association
began its investigative and publicity activities. At once the
number of eclectic schools and the number of their gradu
ates began to decline. By 1915, there were but four eclectic
schools, and since 1920 there has remained but one, the
school in Cincinnati supported by the National Eclectic
Medical Association. True, the Kansas City College of Medi
cine and Surgery has claimed to be eclectic, but the National
Eclectic Association disowns it, and it finds itself of late
involved in a diploma mill scandal. In 1925, the Cincinnati
school had but thirty-eight graduates. Its complete enroll
ment was one hundred and forty-eight. Its average attend
ance during the last five years has been about one hundred.

seventeenth and eighteenth century Europe. The woods and
the fields were combed for all varieties of roots and vines
and grasses, and they were transformed into infusions, decoc
tions, syrups, tinctures, extracts, and tablets. The mind of
the poor medical student was bewildered by his attempts to
learn the botanical names, the nature, and the alleged uses
of these hundreds of drugs. Into this confusion the Council
on Pharmacy and Chemistry swept like a tempest, supported
by blasts from the university laboratories which were care
fully investigating, on animals and on man, the real virtues
of the remedies in use. Farseeing practitioners like William
Osier were condemning the superfluity of preparations, and
urging the use only of such as were actually capable of pro
ducing definite effects in definite dosages. That the plant
remedies survived at all was due not so much to the efforts
of the eclectic colleges as to the manufacturers of eclectic
remedies and, above all, to the promoters of patent medi
cines, which were composed largely of complex mixtures of
such substances —veritable vegetable soups.
A report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry on
one of these eclectic remedies is typical of what has been
done to hundreds of them. Echinacea angustefolia was first
introduced as the main ingredient of a remedy known as
Meyer's Blood Purifier. This preparation, according to the
label, was powerful as an alterative and antiseptic in all
"tumorous and syphilitic indications, old chronic wounds
such as fever sores, old ulcers, carbuncles, piles, eczema, wet
or dry, also erysipelas and gangrene." It was also "a specific
for fever," "adverted typhoid in two or three days," and
cured malaria, malignant, remittent, and mountain fever,
diphtheria, bites "from the bee to the rattlesnake," and mad
dog bites. Obviously a medical gem! The drug was promptly
adopted by the medicos of the eclectic school, and shortly
afterward different proprietary concerns introduced it to the
public under the name of echtisia, ecthol, and echitone. Ech-
tisia contained, in addition to the echinacea, some wild
indigo, arbor vitae, and poke root; and echitone contained
also pansy and blue flag. The company promoting the

former asserted that wild indigo was a "destroyer of devital
izing elements in the blood" and a "vitalizer of the blood
as well," that arbor vitae was "a perfect antiseptic and a
generator of vital force in disorganized tissues," and that a
long list of diseases, including diphtheria, syphilitic sciatica,
and gonorrheal rheumatism, were "all more or less amenable
to full doses" of poke root.
All of this was, of course, the veriest bosh. For the con
ditions mentioned scientific medicine has provided methods
of treatment and remedies that attack the cause. For scarlet
fever it has an antitoxin and it disregards the rhus toxico
dendron of the Eclectic pharmacopoeia; for angina pectoris
it seeks sedation and attempts by intricate surgical methods
to cut off the sensations of pain, discarding the "specific
medicine lobelia" of the eclectics as an unreliable and poi
sonous drug. The recommendation of bryonia for pain over
the eye regardless of the cause, of spigelia for headache over
the top of the head increasing in the morning and decreasing
in the afternoon, of cactus and white hellebore and gel-
semium for oppressive pain on the top of the head caused
by uterine displacement—all of these recommendations,
taken from the guidebooks of eclectic medicine, scientific
medicine greets today with laughter.
"Slowly, but surely, botanical drugs, upon which many
packaged medicines rely for their therapeutic benefits and
for the therapeutic claims made for them, are being dropped
from the United States Pharmacopoeia," says an editorial in
the October, 1925, number of Standard Remedies, the official
organ of the package medicine industry. "Seventeen such
drugs were dropped from the 1920 revision of the Pharma
copoeia just issued. In 1910 twenty-two were dropped. In
1900, eleven were dropped. The few remaining may be
dropped in the next or some future revision." And in an
article in the same issue Mr. H. C. Fuller says: "Publications
of the eclectic school still support many of the therapeutic
claims that have been advanced for a large number of botani
cal drugs that appear in the above list. However, even here

we find a tendency to conservatism and, at times, a repudia
tion of earlier opinions."
Mr. Fuller, a friend of the package medicine industry,
views this situation with alarm. "It is coming to pass." he
says, "that the deletion of botanical drugs from official stand
ards and the omission of references to their therapeutic value
in modern textbooks, as well as definite statements discredit
ing the former ideas of their efficacy, will eventually bring
about the situation that preparations containing these drugs
will have no standing or authoritative support, and will be
thrown back almost solely on testimonials, which experi
ence has demonstrated are often of doubtful value. The
preparations chiefly affected at present are the so-called
Blood Remedies or Alteratives, Rheumatism Remedies, Kid
ney Remedies, Female Remedies and Nerve Remedies."
Here is a statement from an expert as to the present low
state of botanical remedies! Mr. Fuller suggests to the manu
facturers that the proper procedure would be the employ
ment of research with a view to reestablishing in good scien
tific usage the remedies which constitute the basis of their
nostrums. But do not think Mr. Fuller is naive; the available
information indicates that he is prepared to promote such
researches at a reasonable figure.
Thus all the signs and portents indicate that the great
deluge of modern scientific chemotherapy is about to wash
away the plant and vegetable debris. With that washing will
go the last vestiges of Thomsonism and the eclectic practice
of Wooster Beach.
THE DECLINE OF THE ECLECTIC COLLEGES
As I have said, the number of medical schools in the
United States began to increase rapidly after the Civil War.
The creation of many of these schools was due to the self-
interest of the men constituting their faculties. Money was
to be made by teaching students, and prestige was to be
acquired by a self-conferred title of professor. The standards
of medical education in this country thus became an offense
in the sight of the leaders of American medicine. With the

advent of each new medical cult and of each new group of
medical colleges devoted to it, the State legislatures were
besought to create separate boards of examiners for the
licensing of graduates.
Obviously, the medical practice laws in all the states were
intended to safeguard the public against incompetent and
untrained physicians. Where states have but a single board
administering the act, it accomplishes that purpose. Unfortu
nately, when new boards are created for various new types
of practitioners, the medical practice acts are promptly nulli
fied. If there is such a thing as scientific medicine, and if
there are diseases such as smallpox, tuberculosis, typhoid
fever, and measles which produce definite changes in the
human body, every one who wants to treat human disease
ought to be able to recognize the changes they bring about,
to diagnose them when present, and to know how to pre
scribe preventive measures to keep them from spreading
throughout the community. Certainly every one who wants
to practice the healing art by any method of treatment
should be willing to come before an examining body and
give evidence of his knowledge of these fundamental things.
Nevertheless, the legislators in the various states have created
ninety-six separate and independent boards to control med
ical licensure in America. In some states there are actually
five or six different boards created by as many independent
medical practice acts, and vesting as many different standards
of educational qualification.
Out of this confused mass of laws came a great licensure
scandal in 1923, and in that scandal eclectic medical boards
played the most prominent part. In 1918, five years before,
The Journal of the American Medical Association had pro
tested against the manner in which graduates of low-grade
medical colleges in Missouri were being licensed by the
eclectic boards in Arkansas and Connecticut. For the next
five years, it published annually a protest, and indeed insinu
ated definitely that neither the Arkansas State Board of
Eclectic Examiners nor the Kansas City, Missouri, College
of Medicine and Surgery could exist unless they were in

cahoots. Connecticut, too, was warned again and again that
it was harboring a menace in its eclectic board. But in 1920,
the Kansas City College and the Arkansas Eclectic Board
entente were still doing business, the former graduating
thirty-three men and the latter licensing all but one of them,
and in 1921 the Missouri legislature removed the word "rep
utable," as it related to medical colleges, from its medical
practice act and substituted the words, "legally chartered."
In 1922 there developed a new entente: the Connecticut
board licensed seventy-one physicians, sixty-one of whom
graduated from low-grade medical colleges and three from
institutions in California which apparently had never been
recognized as professional schools of any type. Of the seventy-
one medicos licensed in Connecticut, only twenty-five had
actually graduated from eclectic medical colleges, but forty-
six more, who logically should have applied to the so-called
regular medical board, since they had graduated from what
were presumably regular medical colleges, although of ex
tremely low standing, apparently had arranged with the
Eclectic board in Connecticut to provide them with licenses.
The situation, uncovered first by the St. Louis Star, showed
clearly that graduates of the St. Louis College of Physicians
and Surgeons were being shipped to Connecticut so that the
Connecticut Eclectic Board might give them legal entrance
into the practice of medicine. The reciprocity laws between
the various states then permitted them to ooze gradually out
of Connecticut and into other communities.
Following the investigation of 1923, the licenses of
one hundred and sixty-seven physicians who had been cer
tified by the Connecticut Eclectic Board were revoked, but
seventy-three of these physicians were allowed to continue
to practice until their cases are heard by the superior courts.
Any one conversant with legal procedure may figure out how
long it will be until the Supreme Court acts on these
cases and confirms the revocations of licenses. But eclecticism
meanwhile is gasping out its last breaths. It was ill for a long
time; now a lethal draught of scandal has finished it.

provided opportunity for evading the requirement of certain
fundamental knowledge in those who proposed to deal with
the ailments of humanity. In that evasion the separate state
boards dealing with eclecticism seem to have played a most
prominent part. The only hope for the protection of the
public against such dubious cultists lies in having but one
board of medical examiners in each state, and in establish
ing one minimum standard of qualifications to which every
one must measure who is to have the legal right to practice
healing. The exemptions of cults because they limit their
methods of treatment to manipulation, to mental suggestion,
to plant remedies, to highly diluted remedies, or to any
other quackery is merely throwing open the doors to un
qualified, incompetent, mendacious, and unprincipled pre
tenders.
As this volume goes to press there appears an announce
ment of the reopening of the Eclectic Medical College in
Cincinnati which is matriculating a freshman class in 1931
and a sophomore class for 1932. In the introduction to this
announcement appears a new definition for the eclectic phy
sician; namely, "One who has been adequately trained in
the recognized fundamentals of modern scientific medicine,
and has added thereto the special knowledge of eclectic
materia medica and therapeutics." It appears then that eclec
ticism is to proceed as has homeopathy, practicing medicine,
continuing to add thereto such eclectic therapeutics as seem
desirable to the professors of that subject in the eclectic col
lege. It must be borne in mind that the present decade sees
vast numbers of young men applying for entrance into med
ical school who are not able to gain admission, and it is
therefore possible to conduct a medical college with a certain
amount of surety of attendance by students, and with tuition
fees almost sufficient to carry the expense. Thus, the tuition
fees in the eclectic school are to be $300.00 per year per
student, with extra fees for various laboratory courses and
records. The indications are that some forty young men will
be available for each of the classes.
This does not mean, of course, a rejuvenation of eclectic

in botany among this limited group of medical practitioners
to make a recurrence of this medical cult possible. The his
tory of medical science would seem to indicate, however, an
early relapse and a not far distant end. The patient is not
moribund, but very weak.

FROM THE BEGINNING OF MIND HEALING
TO CHRISTIAN SCIENCE
"In those periods when man sees everywhere miracle and nowhere
law, —when he attributes all things which he cannot understand to
a will like his own, —he naturally ascribes his diseases either to the
wrath of a good being or to the malice of an evil being." —Andrew D.
White, "The Warfare of Science With Theology In Christendom."
The
great vogue of Franz Anton Mesmer brought to him
disciples from many places. Soon smaller temples of
magnetic healing sprang up. Many of his disciples, as has
been related in the first chapter, traveled about demonstrat
ing the Mesmeric technic. Obviously such results as they
secured had to do with mental rather than physical defects,
and were secured by the power of suggestion. Out of Mes-
mer's doctrine came all the faith healers of the nineteenth
century. From him derived Elisha Perkins, from him also
derived Phineas Parkhurst Quimby and Mary Morse Baker
Glover Patterson Eddy, Alexander Dowie, Emile Coue\ and
perhaps even Sigmund Freud. Indeed, it is but a small step
from healing by the mind alone to the enhancing of the
power of suggestion by the laying on of hands, and finally
from such manipulations to the practice of chiropractic and
osteopathy.
The beginning of the nineteenth century found Ameri
cans fearful of hell fire. The doctrine of Jonathan Edwards
had brought about a type of mentality which evolved
promptly into hysteria. Moreover, young girls brought up on
Fox's Book of Martyrs and an indoor life quite promptly

developed a condition called chlorosis, which has practically
disappeared in these modern times with the coming of sun
light, outdoor exercise, and fresh air for girls, as well as boys.
Shakerism, New Thought, and Mesmerism were already in
teresting doctrines to many American citizens.
THE RISE OF MARY BAKER EDDY
Mary Morse Baker was born near Concord, New Hamp
shire, on July 16, 1821. She was frail, delicate, oversensitive,
frequently given to spasms and attacks of tantrums. Some
what pleasing in her personality, she was nevertheless hardly
attractive as a child for her beauty. The little girl was smart,
always showing off, putting on airs, using long words when
short ones would suffice, and displaying in other ways some
thing of precocity. Like all hysterics, once she found that her
attacks aroused sympathy, they would be frequently re
peated. When she was in convulsions physicians would be
called, who, no doubt, were quite aware of the proper diag
nosis. Indeed one doctor said that Mary's whole trouble was
"hysteria mixed with bad temper." It is reported that her
father finally became so used to her attacks that he would
simply walk away and give her plenty of time to recover and
go about her daily affairs. Frequently she ran away from
home, but, like all similar flighty young ladies, she invari
ably came back. No one had trouble with Mary when she
could have her way, but when crossed she could put on a
performance that would stop the family.
Fortunately perhaps for her relatives (and she had many
of them) , she was introduced by her brother, Mark Baker,
to a friend named Washington Glover, who was in the con
tracting business in Charleston, South Carolina. In 1843,
when she was 22 years old she married the young man, called
"Wash" for short. She must have had a most uncomfortable
time, brief as it was. Nevertheless, this first marriage may
have been the answer to her problems, because such corres
pondence as is available indicates no difficulties with health
or indeed of any kind whatever. Life with Mary Morse Baker
Glover could not have been exceedingly restful. Regardless

of these theoretical cogitations, six months after their mar
riage Wash Glover developed yellow fever, which was a
prevalent disease in those days. He died promptly and was at
peace.
Left destitute, the young widow was sent by brother
Masons of Glover to New York; from there she went back
to Concord, where in September she gave birth to a son
called George Washington Glover. Promptly she farmed out
the boy to friends, and developed again the spasms, the fits,
the convulsions, and the old hysterical performances that
had made her such a nuisance and indeed such a problem
in her early days. About this time she developed the idea
that she was again a child and had to be rocked to sleep. She
was living with her sister, a widow named Tilton. A cradle
was built for her and hung from the ceiling. Here she would
lie and here for hours at a time her nephew or some boy
from the village would swing Mrs. Glover. The standard fee
varied from a penny to a dime. Gradually she developed
greater and greater lassitude and weakness. No longer would
she even attempt to walk about. She would simply lie in bed
and be waited on.
When she was 32 years old there came to her community
a traveling dentist, homeopath, and sewing machine agent,
named Dr. Daniel Patterson, a handsome man with long,
bushy whiskers, who wore a tall hat and a frock coat and
who might have been the Adolph Menjou of his time. On
June 21, 1853, he married the invalid, and from that time
on they lived a restless existence; living indeed in six cities
in five years, while he practiced some of his professions.
Always they remained until the jealousy of his wife or the
indignation of the husband of some handsome patient caused
Dr. Patterson to move on. During all this period Mary
Morse Baker Glover Patterson occasionally ventured essays
or poems which the village gazettes printed in lieu of mod
ern advertising.
Eventually the Civil War came on, and, perhaps in search
of peace, Doctor Patterson went to war. He was captured and
confined in Libby Prison. Now his wife, 40 years old, left

alone again, lived about with relatives and with friends, a
most unhappy existence, since friends are likely to be crit
ical and relatives may be worse. Under such circumstances
her physical complaints gave her increasing difficulty. She lay
in bed arguing, battling, contesting with everyone. She tried
eclecticism, spiritualism, mesmerism, hydrotherapy, indeed
any type of cure that any type of healer would offer.
PHINEAS PARKHURST QUIMBY
Among the disciples of Mesmer was one Charles Poyen,
who traveled about in the New England states giving lec
tures and demonstrations. These attracted wide attention.
Eventually Poyen came to the town of Belfast in Maine,
where, in 1848, one of his demonstrations was witnessed by
Phineas Parkhurst Quimby, son of a blacksmith, and himself
something of a jeweler and clock maker. Quimby was fasci
nated by the mesmeric demonstration. Poyen found in the
clock maker an unusual personality. He gave him instruc
tions in the mesmeric method.
By this time the magnetic healers had found that it was
possible to fix the attention of the subject to such an extent
that the subject would pass into what is called today a hyp-
noidal or trance state, in which the person is unusually
suggestible. Soon it was found that some persons were much
more easily hypnotized or magnetized than others. Quimby
found a boy 17 years old, named Lucius Burkman, who was
of this sensitive character. So Quimby traveled around with
Lucius Burkman, giving demonstrations in magnetic heal
ing, also predicting the future and finding lost objects.
The physician attempts to diagnose disease by obtaining
the history of the patient, which he correlates with the
stories of patients of previous days who have had similar
experiences. He then makes a physical examination, deter
mining through palpation, percussion and auscultation sig
nificant changes in the normal reactions of the body. Finally,
he may take from the patient specimens of blood and of vari
ous excretions and secretions which are submitted to deter
mine whether or not they are normal.

The magnetic healer merely brought the sick person close
to the subject who was in the hypnoidal state. The subject
would then announce the nature of the illness and prescribe
a remedy. Obviously the performance was impressive and
not a few patients promptly declared themselves benefited
merely from contact with the medium without even waiting
for the remedy that the medium might prescribe. One day
Burkman prescribed a remedy that Quimby did not have.
Quimby therefore substituted another remedy, whereupon
the patient promptly recovered. It then occurred to Quimby
that the remedy was of little importance, but that some vital
force must instead be responsible.
THE RUBBING TREATMENT
At this time he developed what may be called the "rub
bing" treatment, a method which again brings to mind the
idea of electrical phenomena of positive and negative poles.
In this technic, the patient unclad was placed upon a table
before the healer. With one hand the healer rubbed the
center of the patient's abdomen and if the disease happened
to be in the upper half of the body, he rubbed, with the
other hand, the top of the patient's head. If, however, the
disease affected the lower half of the body, the hands were
reversed, the right hand manipulating the region in the
neighborhood of the umbilicus, and the left hand rubbing
the feet. The patient understood from this procedure that
the disease was passing from his body.
Readers will recall the conception of the Leyden jar, the
galvanic cell in Mesmer's temple, Graham's electrical celes
tial bed, Benjamin Franklin's kite which drew down elec
tricity from the skies, and Elisha Perkins' positive and
negative tractors.
MRS. PATTERSON CONSULTS QUIMBY
Soon Quimby found that it was not even necessary to lay
hands on the patient, but that the same results could be
achieved by the mind alone. He thus may be credited with
having been the founder of modern mind healing. Soon

FROM MIND HEALING TO CHRISTIAN SCIENCE
Phineas Parkhurst Quimby was known throughout the New
England states. His consulting room was packed with pa
tients. He was compelled to respond to many requests for
advice and information. By 1861 his repute had reached the
little town in New Hampshire where Mary Morse Baker
Glover Patterson was living previous to the departure of
"the Doctor" for the Union Army. Indeed, Doctor Patterson
wrote on October 14 to Doctor Quimby, asking him to visit
Concord so that he might give his attention to Mrs. Patter
son. In 1862, Mrs. Patterson herself wrote to Quimby beg
ging him to give her attention. Eventually, toward the end
of October, 1862, she accumulated sufficient funds to enable
her to go to Portland, Maine, where she was seen by
Quimby. She staggered into his office, apparently still able
to walk; but then she dropped into a chair, and apparently
went into one of her routines, as the theatrical jargon would
put it. Quimby cured her in two treatments, so that a few
weeks later she climbed 182 steps to the dome of the city
hall as evidence of her recovery. The Christian Scientists
refer to the performance as a miracle. It is not, however, in
any sense of the word remarkable. It represents merely the
treatment by suggestion of a patient with hysterical fits and
paralysis, and the curing of a mental condition by the use of
the mind alone. Such performances are a daily occurrence in
medical practice. The doctors of an earlier day were wont to
relieve hysterical complaints and simulated illnesses by what
is known as the "ice water" method. After the young lady
had remained in bed several days and announced her in
ability to be of assistance in household duties on frequent
occasions, the old family doctor would be called to the bed
side. His diagnosis would be made promptly. Then he would
go out to the pump, break the ice, and pull up a bucket full
of water. Warily approaching the bed with his armamen
tarium hidden behind him, he would suddenly empty the
bucket of ice water on the recumbent damsel. She would
leap from her couch and would soon be found busily wash
ing the dishes, apparently cured by a single treatment.

village in Canada, was asked to see a girl who had lain in
bed for many months apparently paralyzed. He examined
her and found that all of the joints were freely movable.
When a limb has been paralyzed for some time the joint
becomes fixed exactly as does a joint that has been held in a
plaster cast. Moreover, he found that the tissues of one leg
were as good as those of the other, whereas paralysis brought
about by meningitis, or by poliomyelitis or infantile paralysis
produces a wasting of the tissues so that one leg is smaller
than the other. Having determined that the girl was not
subject to any organic disease, he suggested to her the basis
of his information, and by the power of psychotherapy alone
caused her to arise and walk about. This, however, was not
a miracle; it was merely the diagnosis by scientific methods
of the presence of hysterical paralysis and a cure by the
power of suggestion.
THE POWER OF SUGGESTION
Everyone is familiar with the manner in which certain
disturbances may be controlled through fixation of the atten
tion. If one wishes to avoid sneezing, he presses his upper
lip. Hiccups are treated by sipping seven sips of water, by
eating some dry bread, or by fixing the eye on some distant
object, or even by counting to one hundred. If, however, the
hiccups happen to be due to an infectious disorder which
inflames and stimulates the route of the phrenic nerve, send
ing constant stimuli to the diaphragm, the hiccups continue.
Such hiccups are controllable only by physical measures.
There is a story told of two British soldiers who were in the
trenches with great masses of shot and shell flying here and
there. Amidst the thundering of the guns, one of the boys
turned to the other and said, "Scare me, Al, I got the
hiccups." He knew the value of the power of suggestion.
MRS. PATTERSON STUDIES QUIMBY'S TECHNIC
So now Mary Morse Baker Glover Patterson had a new
interest in life. She was 40 years of age, brilliant, vivacious,
and beginning to be handsome. Quimby was 65 years of age.

She sat in adoration at his feet. She wrote love sonnets which
have been collected and which have come to public atten
tion, interesting not for their poetical merit but because she
wrote them. She published a tribute to Quimby in the Port
land Courier, again interesting for its historical relations
rather than for its epic qualities. She determined indeed to
study Quimby's method. In the meantime, Phineas Park-
hurst Quimby had himself become aware of the significance
of his technic and had determined to put it on permanent
record. Uneducated, he called in to assist him the two daugh
ters of a judge who lived in that vicinity, and also his son.
To them he dictated his message. Frequently they would
remonstrate with the old man, pointing out to him his
numerous repetitions. He insisted, however, that everything
be written in his own language, and he said that anything
worth saying once is worth repeating again and again. The
first edition of the book called Science and Health with
Key to the Scriptures is thus a plagiarism of the Quimby
manuscript, for Mrs. Patterson had borrowed Quimby's
texts, and these she used as the basis for her own volume.
The evidence is present even in the repetitions against
which the daughters of the judge remonstrated. The lady
who founded Christian Science was not herself extremely
well educated; her work is full of grammatical errors with
amusing failures to comprehend the meaning of words. She
confused Washington Irving with Charles Dickens, which is
not such a serious error, for even Henry Ford confused

also to have confused adultery and adulteration, a somewhat
more serious error.
MRS. PATTERSON ARRANGES SOME SEPARATIONS
Eventually Doctor Patterson returned from the War. He
had apparently been able to cope with the invalid Mrs.
Patterson, but the healthy lady was a little too much for him.
He finally arranged to pay her an allowance of $200 a year,
and a separation was arranged. Then came the divorce! And
with it, a separation of Mary Morse Baker Glover Patterson

from her sister Abigail, who had taken care of her during the
days of her trials and tribulations. Mrs. Patterson, now 50
years old, lived about with friends and even with acquaint
ances, copying the Quimby manuscripts and preparing for
the world her future revelations. Wherever she went she
preached the doctrine of mind healing. She lived briefly in
the home of a factory worker named Hiram Crafts. She sold
him so certainly on the idea that he gave up his job and
put in the newspaper an announcement of his ability in
mind healing. Unfortunately at this time Mrs. Crafts, who
had been doing the housework while the mind healing
seances were being conducted, decided that a third party in
the home was conducive to disharmony, and Mrs. Patterson
departed for other quarters. She went to the home of a
woman named Webster, presumably to stay for a night, but
she remained many weeks and months. It was from this
home that she was bodily ejected.
Meanwhile such time as she had was spent in working and
reworking and modifying her manuscripts. Finally, in 1868,
in a publication devoted to spiritualism appeared her first
bid as an educator in the field of mind healing. A copy of the
announcement follows:
ANY PERSON desiring to learn how to teach the sick,
can receive from the undersigned instruction, that will
enable them to commence healing on a principle of sci
ence with a success far beyond any of the present modes.
No medicine, electricity, physiology or hygiene required
for unparalleled success in the most difficult cases. No
pay is required unless the skill is obtained.
Address Mrs. MARY B. GLOVER.
Amesbury, Mass. Box 61.
RICHARD KENNEDY JOINS MRS. PATTERSON
And then came another of the men with whom her life
is so intimately bound, a living proof of her fascination and
the personality by which she secured her disciples. In 1870
this remarkable woman, 50 years old, secured as a follower a
boy named Richard Kennedy, 2 1 years old. She had met him

two years before in a home where cogitations on mind
science were a frequent topic of conversation. Then at 21,
she took him as a pupil, associated him with her in her
efforts, and signed with him a contract whereby he promised,
in return for instructions, to provide for her living expenses
and to give her half of his income from his practice. To
gether they went to Lynn, Massachusetts, there to establish
the first school of mind healing, the school from which
thousands of mind healers have come forth to practice their
one-track system of healing on the American people.
LYDIA PINKHAM IN LYNN, MASSACHUSETTS
It is interesting to recall at this time the fact that Lynn,
Massachusetts, was also the home of that other great woman
of New England, saver of American womankind, Mrs. Lydia
Pinkham. She it was who first introduced into American
advertising the two marvelous slogans —"Coming events cast
their shadows before," and "Reach for a vegetable instead of
a sweet."
In Lynn, Massachusetts, in 1870, in the home of a good-
looking school mistress, Susie Magoun, Richard Kennedy
and his elderly preceptor set themselves up as practitioners
of mind science. On a tree in front of the house was nailed
a board reading "Dr. Kennedy." In this land of the free any
body can call himself doctor with impunity. We have doctors
of baking, horseshoeing, and the tonsorial arts. Indeed, the
total number of doctors is exceeded only by the number
of available professors.
Almost from the first the combination of Kennedy and
Glover (for by this time the lady had reverted to her first
husband's name) began to attract patients. Unfortunately,
however, Doctor Kennedy could not keep his hands off his
clients. He began by rubbing their temples with his moist
ened fingers while he recited the ritual developed by Mrs.
Glover. He was sympathetic and he had the personality that
convinces. Few people realized at first, as stated by Stefan
Zweig in his marvelous study of Mrs. Eddy in Mental Heal
ers, that upstairs in one of the rooms was sitting the old lady

who animated Richard Kennedy with her energy. Indeed,
says Zweig, "Never did she show herself in the consulting-
room of her Golem." But from this time on Mrs. Glover
began to realize the value of the shekels that were to pour
from the coffers of the sick into the coffers of Christian
Science. From this time on every step that she took was
marked by a written contract. She had professional cards
printed, calling herself "Mrs. M. Glover, Teacher of Moral
Science."
She now began to receive her pupils. Eventually she gave
courses of twelve lectures, lasting three weeks, for a fee of
$300. The opening fee was $100, but was soon increased to
the $300. Moreover, every member of her class agreed to
pay to her 10 per cent annually of the income received from
practice. It is reported that she had some 1,200 pupils in
four years, who, even at an average fee of $200, must have
yielded a considerable income. Here was a medical school
without prerequisites and a system of practice that anybody
could learn. Here also was a school with an entire course in
twelve lectures and with a textbook consisting merely of one
of Quimby's manuscripts, with Mrs. Glover's improvements,
if they can be called improvements. Indeed, the lady worked
over the manuscript so often that eventually she felt it was
her own.
Much has been written and probably much more will con
tinue to be written concerning the relationship of the elderly
Mary Morse Baker Glover, without the Patterson, and Rich
ard Kennedy. Here was a woman at a critical period in
her life associated with a young man, a woman now begin
ning to feel the thrill of success, able to buy the clothing, the
food, and the necessities of life which had previously been
grudgingly tendered to her. Stefan Zweig feels that she ex
pected from Richard Kennedy something which he did not
and could not give. Indeed, says Zweig, "The woman in her,
the fleshly woman, wanted recognition quite as much as the
prophetess wanted veneration, although she may never have
given a plain sign of it to the young man."

FROM MIND HEALING TO CHRISTIAN SCIENCE
THE QUARREL WITH KENNEDY
One evening a game of cards was played in the home of
Susie Magoun, now Mrs. Dame. In the game were Kennedy,
Mrs. Dame, and Mary Morse Baker Glover. The hand was
won by Kennedy, and Mrs. Glover accused him of cheating.
That night Kennedy produced his contract, tore it up, and
announced that the partnership was at an end. The lady
swooned, but Kennedy had apparently learned enough medi
cine not to take the swoon seriously. He left her to lie where
she had fallen, and the next day paid Mrs. Glover $6,000 in
cash as her share of their two years' partnership. Hell has no
fury like a woman's scorn. From this moment Mrs. Glover
asserted that Kennedy was an evil spirit constantly working
against her. She read him out of the party and accused him
of sending out adverse mental influences against her. Indeed,
she was particularly careful to emphasize the fact that Ken
nedy was not practicing pure mind medicine but was laying
his hands upon the patients. It was at this time that she wrote
the following letter, quoted by Joseph Jastrow in Psychology
of Conviction:
"Among our very first students was the mesmerist afore
said, who has followed the cause of metaphysical healing as
a hound follows his prey. . . . This malpractitioner tried
his best to break down our health before we learned the
cause of our sufferings.
"His mental malpractice has made him a moral leper that
would be shunned as the most prolific cause of sickness and
sin, did the sick understand the cause of their relapses and
protracted treatment, the husband the loss of the wife, and
the mother the death of her child.
"Filled with revenge and evil passions, the malpracti
tioner can only depend on manipulation, and rubs the heads
of patients years together, first incorporating their minds
through this process. . . . Through the control this gives
the practitioner over patients, he readily reaches the mind of
the community to injure another or promote himself, but
none can track his foul course.

"Sooner suffer a doctor infected with smallpox 1
to be
about you than come under the treatment of one who
manipulates his patients' heads.
"The distance from ordinary medical practice to Christian
Science is full many a league in the line of light; but to go
in healing from the use of inanimate drugs to the misuse of
human will power is to drop from the platform of common
manhood into the very mire of iniquity."
This was the beginning of Mrs. Glover's doctrine of
malicious animal magnetism, a phrase which is merely an
other name for witchcraft or magic, but an idea which
preyed so greatly on the mind of this prophet of healing that
she devoted a chapter to it in the third edition of Science
and Health.
THE PLAGIARISM OF SCIENCE AND HEALTH
There is no doubt that the first manuscript from which
Mrs. Glover worked was the Quimby manuscript. To this
she constantly added, and again and again the text was re
written either by her alone or by some of the disciples who
associated themselves with her. The poor lady's education
had never been good, as has been mentioned, and the manu
script shows the effects not only of this lack of education,
but also of the many hands that worked upon it. Wherever
it seemed to lack in order to meet the needs of some special
inquirer, it could always be bolstered up. In the end it rep
resented the creed of Pollyanna that everything is for the
best and that one need simply disregard all of the cruelties
and facts of life. Just as soon as the leaders found that an
aching tooth could be relieved only by extraction, the doc
trines were modified to permit extractions. When it was
realized that a broken bone would heal properly only after
it had good surgical attention, that type of attention was
permitted. But little children went on dying of diphtheria
while their confused parents sat beside the bed and mur
mured that "God is love." It is impossible to estimate exactly
The admission that there is such a thing as smallpox infection
is,
of course,
inconsistent with Mrs. Eddy's precepts, as with her many denials of its reality.

how many children may have died through this persistent
credulity or ignorance in those to whom they had a right to
look for safety, but the number is certainly in the thousands.
There is plenty of evidence that Mrs. Glover developed
her system of science from the Quimby technic. There is
even a letter which she wrote to Julius A. Dresser, successor
to Quimby, begging him to heal her of her spinal affliction
by the Quimby technic. By 1880 the lady had even begun
to deny the existence of Quimby.
MRS. GLOVER PASSES THE CLIMACTERIC
Whenever she wanted to indulge in some remarkable
exacerbation of her personality she could find excuse for it
in a revelation from her special providence. Now, at 55 years
of age, she indulged in what all physicians recognize as the
peculiar mental changes associated with women at the cli
macteric. The records of every type of faith healing and
magic in medicine provide thousands of cases of women who
at this stage in their lives developed complaints which are
largely mental reflections of their physical condition, and
who have been healed by the methods of magic. Stefan
Zweig is convinced that there was always something wrong
with the sex life of Mary Baker, "as was plainly shown by
her indifference (almost detestation) in the matter of her
only child, and by her repeated endeavours to compensate
for this lack of maternal feeling by marrying or adopting
young men." Obviously all these pupils looked upon her as
a goddess and followed her in mute adoration.
DANIEL HARRISON SPOFFORD AND ASA GILBERT EDDY
Following Kennedy, there came into her life Daniel Har
rison Spofford, affectionately called "Harry" by the high
priestess of mind healing. On December 30, 1876, she wrote
to Spofford, "Now, Dr. Spofford, won't you exercise reason
and let me live, or will you kill me? Your mind is just what
has brought on my relapse and I shall never recover if you
do not govern yourself and turn your thoughts wholly away
from me. Do not think of returning to me again. I shall

never again trust a man. They know not what manner of
temptations assail. God produces the separation and I must
submit to it so must you."
Twenty-four hours later, however, Spofford received a
message to the effect that the lady of his bosom was about to
marry a friend to whom he had introduced her, Asa Gilbert
Eddy. Eddy was a bible and sewing machine agent, both
good occupations at a time when the United States was over
whelmed with agents selling sewing machines from door to
door on the installment plan. He was a quiet, self-effacing,
unassuming person; indeed, his sister said of him that he
could do up his own shirts as well as any woman—just the
type for a dominant personality like that of Mary Morse
Baker Glover Patterson. It is interesting that the weakest of
all her spouses should have conferred upon her the name by
which she is now and will forever be known to all the world.
On the marriage certificate both partners gave their ages as
40 which fooled no one, not even themselves.
Mrs. Eddy had thought a great deal of Daniel Harrison
Spofford, but her temperament was such that those whom
she could not love she hated. Now that she was married to
Eddy, the wrath that had previously been bestowed on
Kennedy was thrown to Spofford, even though she had given
him the gold pen with which she insisted that she had first
written Science and Health. She now pursued him with mal
evolence that is typical of her type of mentality. In 1878 at
Salem, Massachusetts, noted for its trials for witchcraft, suit
was brought against Daniel Harrison Spofford, charging him
with malicious animal magnetism. His attorney pleaded that
it was not in the power of the law to control a man's mind,
and the hearing was dismissed. One night Daniel Spofford
was seized upon in the streets and beaten; indeed, given
what is now called the "Chicago treatment." His response
was to bring suit for damages—and he had damages—against
Eddy. It was wise to resort to the law. Our present charla
tans continually resort to the law as a means of justification
and for the publicity that it will bring. Mrs. Mary Morse
Baker Glover Patterson Eddy was always in the courts, in

deed so frequently that the judges used to welcome her with
smiles on each new appearance.
She passed through all of the vicissitudes of every cultist
leader. Sometimes her disciples withdrew in a body, but in
variably they or others returned. In 1882, when she was over
60 years of age, because of difficulties with some of her asso
ciates in Lynn, she removed to Boston. In the same year
there passed from this world her last official husband, Asa
Gilbert Eddy. He died of heart disease, which must have
been a great disappointment to the lady who maintained
that disease was just a figment of the imagination. At this
time her battered mind developed the notion that Eddy had
been destroyed by her enemies, so she insisted on a post
mortem, which revealed endocarditis and myocarditis, a de
struction of the inner lining and of the muscles of the heart,
due undoubtedly to infection. The lady refused to accept
the scientific evidence of post-mortem examination. She in
sisted that he had been murdered by metaphysical arsenic or
mental poison, and in an interview with the Boston Post she
reiterated that it was "mesmeric poison" that had destroyed
her husband.
REJUVENATION AT SIXTY-ONE
At 61 years of age most women are content, even in these
modern times when grandmothers, in short skirts and with
the aid of the beauty parlor, prance about in night clubs
until the early hours of the morning, to spend much of their
time resting quietly by the fire. But not Mary Morse Baker
Glover Patterson Eddy! At this age she was just beginning to
develop her magnificent organization in Boston. She pur
chased a three-story mansion, installed a lecture theater,
marked her door with a silver plate. She read regularly on
Sundays in her church and founded her monthly paper for
the spreading of her propaganda. Each of the healers who
went forth were agents for her magazine and her bible.
Money poured in steadily and the doctrine grew. All sorts of
subsidies were developed and the great central organization
profited by each of them. The articles for sale included

authentic photographs of the prophetess at $5 each, pam
phlets, badges and books. There were even "Christian
science" spoons, for this was the time of the spoon fad in
the United States. These spoons carried Mrs. Eddy's por
trait in enamel.
Mrs. Eddy loved money, but she loved power even more.
Perhaps money to her meant nothing but power, but from
this time on money seems to have been the driving motive
of her life. In the seventieth year of her life she retired to
her home in Concord, New Hampshire, from which, how
ever, she issued the edicts which made the final changes in
her great organization. At this time preachers in the church
were replaced by readers, the mother church was established
to receive all funds controlled by a central board of direc
tors, and there was a definite understanding that the capital
could not be spent but only the income.
At this age she naturally began to suffer with pains that
come to all the aged. There is plenty of evidence that she
had her pains alleviated by the methods usually adopted by
medical science; the prescriptions for morphine are avail
able, showing how she secured relief.
FOSTER EDDY AND CALVIN A. FRYE
Still perhaps driven by the motives which had dominated
her earlier life, she now adopted a homeopathic physician
named Dr. Ebenezer J. Foster and renamed him Foster Eddy.
But when she heard that Foster had become occasionally
addicted to interest in somewhat younger ladies, she parted
company with him, and turned to the factotum who domi
nated her in the concluding years of her life, Calvin A. Frye.
He it was who kept her books, served as a footman when she
went out driving, gave her injections of morphine, and
guided and dominated completely her closing years. She
spoke of him constantly as "the most disagreeable man that
can be found," but their relationship was perhaps of that
masochistic type which makes the servant delight in his in
feriority, but makes him actually master of the one he serves.

FROM MIND HEALING TO CHRISTIAN SCIENCE
THE APOTHEOSIS
In 1902, just before she died, Mrs. Eddy raised $2,000,000
for the building of the great church in Boston. In 1906 the
church was dedicated, and delegates from all over the world
attended the triumph. Mrs. Eddy did not attend. She
thought it better perhaps not to have the world see her
physically a wreck, mentally failing, about to die. Since the
enemies of her church now made the charge that this woman
who had denied physical existence was herself about to suc
cumb to mortal destruction, arrangements were made for an
interview with representatives of the press at her home in
Concord. The arts of beautification, subsequently to be de
scribed in this volume, had not yet been developed to their
present high standing. The arts that permit Fanny Ward,
Sophie Tucker, and other somewhat ancient performers on
the public stage to have the appearance of youth had not
been made available. Mrs. Eddy appeared rouged, powdered,
and decorated with a diamond necklace, ermine cloak, and
ostrich plumes, but with all these accompaniments she was
merely the shadow of a being.
Each day she used to drive through the streets that the
faithful might look upon her. One day an adventurous re
porter from the New York World leaped on the step of the
carriage, took the umbrella from the hand of the woman,
and discovered that not Mrs. Eddy but her maid, dressed to
resemble Mrs. Eddy, was receiving the adoration of the
faithful.
When she died and her remains were conveyed to their
place of burial, it was found necessary to have one engine
precede and one follow her last conveyance so that the body
might be protected from any material accident.

follies for its demonstration of the life of a great cultist

mental medicine in the United States. A recent survey by
Dr. Louis S. Reed indicates that there are in the United
States today approximately 8,848 practitioners located in
every state of the Union, but primarily in California where
there are 1,887, or 34 to every one hundred thousand inhabi
tants. The District of Columbia, Colorado, New Hampshire,
Massachusetts, and Illinois also have large numbers in pro
portion to their populations. Most of the healers are located
in the large cities rather than in rural districts. Strangely
enough there are 44 1 Christian Science nurses who cooperate
with the practitioners. Another interesting fact is the indi
cation that 90 per cent of all Christian Science practitioners
are women. Whether this is due to the influence of the high
priestess in the establishment of the cult, or whether it is due
to the fact that few healers practice their belief as a full time
occupation it is difficult to say. Certainly the big money
makers in many instances are men who practice their art on
the ladies of leisure to whom the attentions of the faith
healer are merely a method of occupying the mind —or
maybe not only the mind.
It has been estimated that there are approximately
2,000,000 of the 120,000,000 people in the United States
who are affiliated with Christian Science, and that altogether
there are some 10,000,000 of our people who think first of
faith and second of science in time of disease. Personally I
have no wish to interfere with any adult choosing any
method of healing that he may desire, but I burn with anger
when I learn of a father or a mother who has sat solemnly
by a bedside mumbling Mary Eddy's metaphysics while a
child slowly strangles to death with diphtheria. There is
plenty of evidence that many hundreds of misguided Chris
tian Science parents have sat in exactly that manner and
watched their children die.
Christian Science happens to be a woman's religion. Out
of 137,000 members, 103,000 were women. This may be
contrasted with the two-thirds to one-third proportion that
exists in the Episcopal and Presbyterian churches and the

almost even number of men and women associated in the
Catholic church.
Until recent years, Christian Science, through its business
methods, was able to dominate the press so that newspapers
would print no word of criticism, magazines no articles of
sensation, and publishers no books of facts. Within the last
few years the censorship has been broken, culminating in the
famous volume by Edwin Franden Dakin, entitled Mrs.
Eddy, the Biography of a Virginal Mind, in 1930. The Dakin
book reveals all of the facts of Mrs. Eddy's life. An attempt
was made by the Christian Science church to prevent its
sale and indeed to buy up the books, but without success.
Today it is even to be found on drug store book counters
and can be bought for a dollar. The response of the church
was to republish the so-called authentic biography by Sybil
Wilbur, which is a glorification of the high priestess and to
permit C. Lyman Powell, who had once written a somewhat
skeptical biography, to rewrite his book as a saccharinelike
appreciation of Christian Science.
The investigations of Doctor Reed indicate that the aver
age income of Christian Science healers is approximately
$1,500 a year net.
CHRISTIAN SCIENCE OFFSHOOTS
As a whole the people of the United States spend
$9,000,000 annually in this form of healing. With Christian
Science, however, have come some thirty-five or more other
forms of mental healing, many of them including the word
"science" associated with some other term. There is, for
instance, "Divine science," "Applied science," and "Uni
fied science," and New York City has a "Jewish science."
The latter has its bible, a book called Jewish Science and
Health, with a Key to the Scriptures. Its founder is Rabbi
Morris Lichtenstein, who began the cult in 1922, with the
idea, no doubt, that it was hardly fair for the gentiles to
have a monopoly on this system of easy money.
The Church of the Universal Design is an outgrowth of
Christian Science. New Thought seems to include all of the

modern religious healing cults as represented not only by
International New Thought Alliance, but also by Divine
Science, Home of Truth, Practical Christianity, the Church
of the Truth, the Emmanuel Movement, and Christ Psy
chology. In Kansas City, the Unity movement, begun in
1886, broadcasts health over the radio by the mind method
and publishes vast numbers of books, periodicals, and pam
phlets. Constantly in the healing room one hundred healers
sit broadcasting prayers for those who write in requesting
help.
Absent treatment is perhaps one of the most astounding of
all of the accompaniments of mind healing methods. There
is actually on record an instance of a woman who, after being
treated by a Christian Science healer in California, returned
home, making a contract with the healer to continue
the absent treatment for another year. The woman unfortu
nately died three months after returning home, but the
healer continued the absent treatments for the term of the
contract. Then he tried to collect from her estate for the
absent treatment given to her for nine months after her
death. No doubt, the treatments did her a great deal of good
wherever she happened to be during those nine months. He
argued that he had fulfilled his part of the contract and was
therefore entitled to his fee. In failing to live for the term
of the contract, she had merely failed to fulfil her part of
the agreement.

OFFSHOOTS OF FAITH HEALING
"Men who have withstood the many buffetings of life without falter
ing, but also without looking beyond, are panic-stricken, and tremble
at the restful vision of the release into forgetfulness."
—Georges Clemenceatt, "In the Evening of My Thought."
Out
of Christian Science and New Thought have come a
variety of faith healers who depend wholly on the power
of suggestion for their results. The manipulative healers de
pend on the power of suggestion but they also practice the
laying on of hands. The naturopaths depend on the power
of suggestion but they recognize the virtues of fresh air, sun
light, and frequent baths. No doubt the modern psycho
analysts also and, indeed, even the psychotherapists depend
much on the power of suggestion, but they at least know
what they are doing and are under no illusions as to a divine
background or a religious inspiration. The doctrines which
follow represent systems of faith healing with cultist leaders
who exploited the system for personal gain.
CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHERS
The Christian Philosophical Institute, Wilbert LeRoy
Casper, D.C., Ph.D., Bishop, has held forth in Oakland, Cali
fornia. It advertised health-happiness-prosperity, personally
or by mail. Private treatments were $10 a month, group
treatments by the Watch-Tower staff $1 a month. The first
consultation is with "Dr. Casper who, for his own satisfac
tion, uses the Sixth Sense method of mental discernment in
locating the patient's ailments." Casper plays the cult game

clear across the board. He grants degrees of D.D. and C.P.
in six months, conferring a beautiful diploma. The D.D. was
$50; C.P., $100. He promoted a moving picture called the
Kingdom of Human Hearts. The lady who played the role of
"Faith" sued him for $6,255 back salary as secretary and
actress. In 1924 he went bankrupt, listing his assets as 12
collection boxes, 12 collection bottles, 11 boxes of posters,
and a painting eight feet square (value unknown) . When
he ran afoul of the law, testimony indicated his connection
with certain osteopaths. He practiced obstetrics, endeavor
ing to conjure forth the child by dancing about, laying on
hands, and boisterous conduct generally.
CHURCH OF THE UNIVERSAL DESIGN
This group, formerly known as the Christian Science
Parent Church, is headed by John V. Dittemore, formerly
a director in Mrs. Eddy's great organization. It represents
a secession from the central group and is unique in advo
cating cooperation with physicians. Indeed, it offered two
physicians the cooperation of its practitioners should they
wish to avail themselves of such service.
COUEISM
Out of France, heralded by such exploitation as was never
before given to the introduction of any new system of heal
ing, came Emile Coue\ druggist, of Nancy. The system that
he urged was "Self-Mastery by Conscious Autosuggestion."
According to Coue\ the power to control the activities of the
body by autosuggestion is, like sin, an original endowment.
Every human being possesses it at birth, and if one knows
how to practice it consciously one may bring physical health
to the sick, moral health to the neurotic and erring, and
guide into right paths those who incline to dalliance along
the primrose way.
Among the testimonials published by Coue and his fol
lowers were claims for the cure of organic heart disease,
tuberculosis, asthma, prolapse of the uterus, hunchback, in
fection of the frontal sinus that had resisted eleven opera

tions, paralysis of the limbs, club foot, bunions, varicose
ulcer, and practically everything that made anybody sick,
anywhere, any time.
The method of M. Coue was simplicity itself. The patient
is instructed as follows:
Every morning before you are fully awake and every eve
ning as soon as you are in bed, close your eyes and murmur
twenty times: "Day by day in every way I'm getting better
and better." It is well to be provided with a piece of string
with twenty knots tied in it so that the counting may be
mechanical. Let this autosuggestion be made with confidence
and with faith. The greater the confidence, the more rapid
and certain the results. Further, each time, whether by day
or by night, a physical and moral suffering is experienced,
affirm instantly to yourself that you will not consciously en
courage its existence and that you can make it disappear.
Then, if possible, close your eyes and isolate yourself in
thought, pass your hands lightly over the seat of pain, or on
the forehead if the suffering be mental, and say as quickly as
possible aloud, as long as is necessary, "It's going." On each
recurrence of the pain, employ the same method. These exer
cises must be made with great simplicity and, above all,
without effort.
This is, of course, merely Christian Science with reverse
English. If the patient has a tumor of the spinal cord, an
infection of the heart, or a cancer of the stomach, and if he
is under the care of a competent physician, he can do no
harm by occupying his spare moments in the mental exer
cises suggested.
When M. Coue" himself conducted the cure the procedure
was much more elaborate. Then he emphasized to his people
the functioning of every organ, calling each by its name.
The prophet actually became lyrical. He told his patients
that they would sleep soundly, that their dreams would be
pleasant, that troubles and worries would melt away, that
they would awaken to sing, not sigh, that there would be no
more fears, no more thoughts of unkindness, and that shy
ness and self-consciousness would vanish. Above all, M. Coue

assured the waiting hundreds that the stomach and intestines
would function regularly and copiously. So persuasive were
his words that the vice provost of Eton related how, at one
of the seances, "hardly had M. Coue finished speaking of the
certain cure of constipation when the sufferer he had been
addressing hurried from the room, announcing with mingled
surprise and triumph that the event was going to justify the
prediction." Truly words may move mountains!
Scientifically expressed, the laws of M. Cou£ were: When
the will and the imagination are antagonistic, the imagina
tion always wins. In the conflict between the will and the
imagination the force of the imagination is in direct ratio to
the square of the will. When the will and the imagination
are in one agreement, one is multiplied by the other. The
imagination can be directed. To accept any of these laws as
established, or as consistent with the established principles of
psychology is quite impossible. Moreover, they conflict with
common sense and with the facts of human disease as they
have been established by medical science.
So, M. Coue" came to the United States, heralded by news
paper publicity planned by a great syndicate, whose man
agers should have known better. During his tour he was
featured by radio, by motion picture, by lecture, and by all
the other plans that the publicists use for snaring the
unwary.
The man himself gave an impression of sincerity and
childlike earnestness. He seemed genuinely convinced of his
own powers of healing and of the fact that he had made a
great contribution to medical science. Of the many cults
built on faith healing his was the first that had not been
erected on a religious basis with more or less specific claims
of divine inspiration, and this, no doubt, was partially re
sponsible for its speedy tendency to oblivion. In one of his
meetings in Chicago an elderly woman, emaciated, feeble,
short of breath and with every appearance of heart disease
was urged, stimulated, and encouraged to walk vigorously.
Under the stimulus of the excitement she succeeded tem
porarily by the exercise of every reserve of energy, and after

having served the purpose of this demonstration she retired
from view, panting and exhausted. Later it was found that
death had undoubtedly been hastened in several patients by
this urging to an activity which the weakened organs could
not bear.
The atmosphere of a Coue demonstration was like that of
a vaudeville hypnotist; the magic words, the mesmeric
passes, and even the old parlor trick of suggesting to mem
bers of the audience that they could not separate their hands
after they had pressed them tightly together, were utilized
to hold attention. And in the background were the crippled,
the deformed, and the disappointed dupes decoyed by the
careless sensationalism of the press.
"M. Coue gave four performances at Orchestra Hall (in
Chicago) , seating about 3,700 persons, with a top price of
$2.00," wrote Paul Leach. "On the one side of the footlights,
3,600 persons, there to see a new show, something different to
please their appetites satiated with fox-trot dancing, cats and
canaries, and Ziegfeld Follies. On the other side of the foot
lights, the man who earnestly tries to tell them all that he is
no miracle worker; behind him more than one hundred
cripples. Whether he cures some or not, I have a mental pic
ture of a mother who sat in the front row on the stage,
directly behind the man from Nancy, on her knees an eight-
year-old boy whose eyes have never seen. The boy sat with
bowed head, patiently, now and then twisting his slender
fingers, an eager smile on his lips. He had been told he
would be made to see.
"There come storms of applause from the other side of
the footlights.
"
'What is it?' the blind boy asks eagerly.
"
'Someone has been cured,' he is told.
"Outside, half an hour later, the boy patiently asks why
M. Coue did not make him see with his eyes that have never
seen.

persons at four Coue performances had a new thrill. The
eight-year-old blind boy still sits patiently twisting long
fingers and wondering why."
The Nancy to which M. Coue returned to quiet oblivion
was the home of a school of scientific hypnotism, under the
leadership of the great psychologists Liebeault and Bern-
heim, famous in the sixth and subsequent decades of the
nineteenth century. The abrupt relief of hysterical symp
toms by suggestion and persuasion is a commonplace in the
practice of the average physician. Unconsciously it is used
by every successful doctor in the form of encouragement and
optimistic predictions of recovery. It is the basis of the cult
of healing brought to high financial power by Mrs. .Mary
Baker Glover Eddy. As long as there are fools to believe, it
can always be made the basis of a successful faith-healing
cult. And as long as there are men there will always be
believers.
Not long after Coue returned to France he died. He left
little of the funds he might have accumulated. Apparently
the promoters had taken the lion's share. When the prophet
dies, the cult soon passes to purgatory with him, unless, as
was the case of Mary Baker Eddy, it has a financial genius
to arrange properly for its continuation.
DIVINE SCIENCE
Treatment of illness by "Divine Science" consists in per
suading the sufferer that God is good, that disease is the
result of man's own foolishness, and that God will cure him
if he will give him a chance. These simple doctrines are
shrouded, however, in the usual preposterous verbosity.
Faith is secured by prayer, with the laying on of hands. The
followers of Dowie, Schlatter, Newell, Hickson, Voliva, and
more recently John Murray, are the chief disciples of this
school of healing.
DOWIEISM
About 1900 Alexander Dowie announced that he was the
prophet Elijah returned to earth, although without a chariot.

OFFSHOOTS OF FAITH HEALING
He healed by the laying on of hands. His system was obvi
ously faith healing. As a promoter Dowie was no doubt
second only to Mrs. Eddy in this country. He built up a
large following, established a city with tremendous indus
tries, and formulated church observances and a ritual suf
ficient to occupy the minds of those who followed him. Like
other prophets of healing he thundered against physicians
and attacked preventive vaccination. When he passed on, the
holy robes succeeded to Glen Wilbur Voliva, now the czar
of Zion City, the Jerusalem of the cult. Voliva thinks the
world is flat.
EMMANUEL MOVEMENT
In 1906 the Emmanuel Church Health Class was organ
ized by Dr. Elwood Worcester and Dr. Samuel McComb,
rector of Emmanuel Church, an Episcopalian church in
Boston. It was planned perhaps as a resisting movement to
Eddyism, with a view to combining the knowledge of a phy
sician and the influence of the church in the healing of
nervous and mental diseases. The movement spread; other
churches were established and books were sold in profusion.
As long as it is limited to the mental conditions Emmanuel-
ism probably does little harm. One wonders how far it sub
stitutes a religious interest for some underlying mental habit
that is responsible for the illness and that ought to be re
moved. How far does it fail by overlooking organic causes of
mental disease?
JEWISH SCIENCE
Rabbi Morris Lichtenstein, perhaps somewhat jealous of
the profits of Christian Science, prepared a book of Jewish
Science and Health with all of the orotund verbosity of the
work which he affected to simulate. He established an elabo
rate ritual or prayers, a health prayer consisting of two
parts: first, the visualization of divine giving and, then, of
man's receiving the process of healing and the state of health
restored through that process. If any particular organ of the
body is affected, the prayer must affirm that health is saturat
ing and obliterating all defection and suffering.

FADS AND QUACKERY IN HEALING
Founded in 1922, this cult has made but little progress
since that date. Rabbi Lichtenstein seems to have been over
whelmed by mysticism. He argues that the divine mind
communicates with the human mind through the imagina
tion. Therefore, the human mind should never form nega
tive images but must constantly affirm that health is sat
urating the system. The cult gives opportunity to a few
exploiters to become Jewish Science practitioners. These
healers offer prayers and induce in the patient a religious,
hopeful attitude—and many a hope has been disappointed.
The Reverend Lichtenstein wrote to Dr. Louis S. Reed early
in 1931, suggesting that most of the cases treated by his
group are cases of neurasthenia and general depression. The
financial depression which began in 1929 increased tremen
dously the number of adherents to strange metaphysical
doctrines and deluged the country with astrologers, numer-
ologists, fortune tellers, and similar mystics whose sole pur
pose was to induce hope in those whose belief in life had
been destroyed.
LEONIC HEALERS
A group of colored mystics established themselves in New
York City and advertised their healing powers under the
signs of the zodiac, offering at the same time horoscopic
service and direction. The authorities, believing the "Leonic
healers" to be more "lyin'
"
than Leonic, arrested the group
and secured the assessment of small fines in municipal
courts. The enterprise was shortly abandoned.
NEW THOUGHT
The term "New Thought" covers the teaching of all of
the modern healing cults, including Christian Science and
Jewish Science. It is, however, promoted through the Na
tional New Thought Society and the International New
Thought Alliance. Its legitimate predecessor was the "Tran
scendental Movement" of 1830, and it is influenced by the
doctrines of reincarnation and telepathy. Numerous teachers
give lectures on relaxation, visualization, accomplishment

and manifestation, and activities with music, rhythmic exer
cise, "vitalic" breathing, and similar bunk. Hindus and Sene-
gambians costumed like Hindus, have their followers in
centers of Yogi philosophy and mysticism. At the last annual
convention, ten thousand dreamers were present. The New
Thought bible is Ralph Trine's book, In Tune with the
Infinite, which has passed through several hundred editions.
The New Thought group is, after all, the antecedent not
only of Christian Science but of Divine Science, the Uni
versity of Christ, the Home of Truth, Practical Christianity,
the Church of the Truth, Christ's Psychology, and many
similar groups. Of late, New Thought has taken into its
fold all of the actual Yogis and Hindu philosophers who
have toured our country; and many a Senegambian of mixed
blood, who has straightened his curly locks by the use of
Madam Walker's patented preparations, is showing as a
Hindu mystic before some American audience.
The difference between Christian Science and New
Thought is much the same as the difference between chiro
practic and naturopathy. Chiropractic tells the individual
that a bone is pressing on his nerve and must be pulled off
Naturopathy insists that a ligament is responsible and must
be pulled off. Christian Science tells its believers to fight
and to affirm health. New Thought tells its followers to
relax so that the divine spirit may overcome them. More
over, New Thought has lent itself especially to the great
American craze for commercial success. Whereas most other
cults emphasize healing, New Thought emphasizes success in
business. Among some of the pamphlets recently issued are
the following: "Getting On," "Faith and Success," "Dollars
Want Me," "Health and Wealth from Within." Its an
nouncements read like those burlesque advertisements in
Ballyhoo, Hooey, and similar publications which begin,
"They spoke to me in French, and were they surprised when
I answered them I" They have seized on the newer psychol
ogy and exploited it to the utmost. One suggestion reads:
"Stand up before your mirror every morning and say; 'I'm
it, I'm it, I'm as good as you are and a whole lot better.'

rawson's SCHOOL
F. S. Rawson founded a school in 1919, which works on
the negative rather than on the positive principle. The per
son is supposed to deny vehemently again and again the
thing that he does not want. Obviously, this also is Christian
Science with reverse English. Some hundred practitioners
find it commercially successful.
SCIENTIFIC CHRISTIANITY
With headquarters in Kansas City, this organization pub
lishes Unity, with a circulation of 185,000. It sends out lec
turers, organizes communities, maintains prayer services,
reaching some three to five million people yearly, not count
ing its recent attempts on the radio. The periodical is full of
the usual preposterous testimonials of too credulous victims.
A lady in Hot Springs sends a tithe of $50 because a hail
storm passed over her front yard. The funds come from
tithings of 10 per cent. The headquarters in New York is
directed by Mr. Richard Lynch, who talks on health, happi
ness, prosperity, and character formation to from three hun
dred to five hundred people. In 1923, he had an audience
of six. He has probably, however, reached his maximum
growth.
What absent treatment is to Christian Science the Unity
Movement or Scientific Christianity is to New Thought.
Here is the promise, "Health, happiness, and prosperity for
a dollar!" This group was founded by Charles and Myrtle
Fillmore in 1886. From the headquarters in Kansas City
emanate millions of pamphlets. The catalogue says that
1,472,000 books, magazines, and tracts are issued every
month. The radio station works constantly broadcasting
health to the believers. Ninety workers sit hour after hour
offering prayers for those who write requesting help.

most credulous are likely to believe in its healing virtues.

OFFSHOOTS OF FAITH HEALING
The beliefs that insanity is due to the poisons of evil spirits
and that the ghosts of famous physicians are able to write
prescriptions through a medium are so absurd as to merit
hardly a moment's attention. Dr. Titus Bull in New York
maintains that he has the power to heal by driving out evil
spirits through his own saintliness and by the laying on of
hands. The idea that there can be anything saintly in this
laying on of hands, in the vernacular of the day, is Titus'
"bull."
THEOSOPHY
Theosophy embodies telepathy and spiritualism with
health interests somewhat secondary. Nevertheless, much is
made of the ability to produce relaxation and relief of pain
by earnest prayer, a sort of "spiritual anesthetic." A church
mission of healing in New York, using this cult, is carried
on by the Rev. Thomas Calvert, who has developed his own
system of psychoanalysis and complexes, and who will put
them to work at $5 for forty-five minutes, $10 for ninety
minutes, or $15 for two hours.
One Dr. John D. Quackenbos, with the accent on the first
syllable of the last name, claimed that he has cured more
than twenty thousand cases of drug addiction by a system of
mental maneuvers associated with metaphysical healing.

OSTEOPATHY
"Despite our remarkable advance of knowledge, nonsense is ever be
coming bolder and more rampant; it is preeminently a time of fads
and crazes, and the question as to how people are to be brought to
their senses grows urgent."—W. Duncan McKim.
"For centuries deductions based upon hypotheses have served as the
basis upon which the thought and conduct of the human individual
have been interpreted." —Stewart Paton.
"/an June 22, 1874," says Andrew Still, in his autobiog-
v-/ raphy, "I flung to the breeze the banner of osteopathy."
Before flinging it Still had been a free-lance doctor among
the Shawnee Indians in Kansas. "I soon learned to speak
their tongue," he says, "and gave them such drugs as white
men used, cured most of the cases that I met, and was well
received by the Shawnees."
The founder and promulgator of osteopathy, a most ex
traordinary doctrine of human disease and its causation, was
born in Lee County, Virginia, on August 6, 1828. It appears
likely that his great-grandfather came to Buncombe County,
North Carolina, from England; the almost irrelevant fact is
cited merely because of the name of the county. The Still
family was early American out of English and Irish, German
and Scotch sources. Andrew Still was no accepter of author
ity even in his youthful days. He refused to attend one
school because he and the teacher did not agree. The father
of Andrew Still was a minister, doctor, farmer, and mill
wright; his mother, according to Andrew, was "a natural
mechanic, and made cloth, clothing, and pies to perfection."
Analyzing the statements it seems probable that Still dis

covered these unusual mechanical talents in his ancestry
after he himself had developed his mechanical conception of
the cause and cure of the ills that flesh may acquire or be
heir to.
While traveling about on the frontier Andrew Still be
came interested in some bones dug up in an Indian grave
yard. From his subtle cogitations on these osteological rem
nants, he became convinced that the bones are the most im
portant elements in the functioning of the human body, and
that the backbone is the bone of all bones in the control of
disease. On this point, in fact, he felt himself the recipient
of a divine revelation, as he emphasizes repeatedly in his
story of his life. "Have faith in God as an architect and the
final triumph of truth, and all will end well," he says; and
again: "Osteopathy is the greatest scientific gift of God to
man." And still later he wrote:
Osteopathy is simply this: The law of human life is abso
lute, and I believe that God has placed the remedy for every
disease within the material house in which the spirit of life
dwells. I believe that the Maker of man has deposited in
some part or throughout the whole system of the human
body drugs in abundance to cure all infirmities; that all the
remedies necessary to health are compounded within the
human body. They can be administered by adjusting the
body in such manner that the remedies may naturally asso
ciate themselves together. And I have never failed to find all
these remedies. At times some seemed to be out of reach, but
by a close study I always found them. So I hold that man
should study and use only the drugs that are found in his
own drug-store —that
is,
in his own body.
There
is
Andrew Still's conception of his revelation. The
belief in private and confidential relationships with the
Deity, as has been pointed out, seems to be an inevitable
part of the credo of every healing cult that has interfered
with the progress of scientific medicine. It
is
perhaps
a
necessary ingredient;
it
lights an inward flame which gives
the founder and prophet the power to attract his great
hordes of fanatical followers. After all, in this statement

FADS AND QUACKERY IN HEALING
Andrew Still reveals the basis on which are founded the
claims of all the healing cults, that they have the power to
cure disease. Here he merely expresses his conception of
what has been called the vis medicatrix naturae, the innate
tendency of the body to overcome its afflictions.
In the spring of 1864 two children and an adopted child
of Andrew Still died of meningitis. The mental shock to the
father was severe. "I propounded to myself the serious ques
tions," he says,

guessing? Guess what is the matter? What to give, and guess
the result? And when dead, guess where he goes?'
"
In these
questions are forecast the dissatisfaction of the man with the
ignorance of his time so far as concerns the causes of disease
and also his subsequent belief in spiritualism and his own
alleged powers of telepathy. Today scientific medicine knows
the cause of meningitis; it uses the antimeningococcic serum
that has changed a disease with almost one hundred per cent
of mortality to one that, seen early and properly treated, has
a mortality of only some ten per cent. It is interesting to
think that there might have been no osteopathy if the knowl
edge of the present day had been available for the family of
Andrew Still.
The mechanical trend of the mind of the apostle of osteop
athy is shown by his devotion to agricultural inventions
between 1855 and 1870. He credits himself with the inven
tion of the automatic reaper, telling that representatives of
the Wood Mowing Machine Company visited him and ap
propriated his idea. "Wood had the benefit of my idea in
dollars and cents," he says, "and I had the experience."
Then, too, he developed a mechanical churn.
EARLY DAYS OF ANDREW STILL
Now it must be borne in mind that for some fifteen years
at least Andrew Still had given little if any of his time to
the diagnosis and treatment of disease. In his autobiography
he tells us that his mind had been busy with anatomy con
tinuously and that finally the great revelation came to him.
Early in the sixties he had taken a course of instruction in

the Kansas City School of Physicians and Surgeons, and had,
no doubt, practiced for a while, but the intervention of the
Civil War and his subsequent preoccupation with his inven
tions quite definitely removed him from matters medical. It
appears that he tried to introduce osteopathy at Baldwin
University in Kansas but the faculty turned him from the
door. He went to visit his brother in Missouri, whom he
found to be using "seventy-five bottles of morphine annu
ally," and he "got him free from opium." Then he went to
Kirksville, Missouri, stayed three months, and in May, 1875,
sent for his wife and family. In the preface to his autobiog
raphy the sage of osteopathy admits that he may be wrong
at times as to places and dates, and at this time he does ap
pear to be a little confused. He places great importance on
a case seen and treated in Macon, Missouri, in the autumn
of 1874. Here, it appears, he followed a woman with three
children on the street and noticed that one child was suf
fering with what he calls a bloody "flux," so severe that
blood was visible all along the sidewalk. He offered to help
the woman home with the boy, and he describes pictur
esquely the course of the cure:
/ picked him up and placed my hand on the small of his
back. I found it hot, while the abdomen was cold. The neck
and the back of the head were also very warm and the face
and nose very cold. This set me to reasoning, for up to that
time the most I knew of flux was that it was fatal in a great
many cases. I had never before asked myself the question:
What is flux? I began to reason about the spinal cord which
gives off its motor nerves to the front of the body, its sensory
to the back; but that gave no clue to flux. Beginning at the
base of the child's brain, I found rigid and loose places in the
muscles and ligaments of the whole spine, while the lumbar
portion was very much congested and rigid. The thought
came to me like a flash, that there might be a strain or some
partial dislocation of the bones of the spine or ribs, and that
by pressure I could push some of the hot to the cold places,
and by so doing adjust the bones and set free the nerve and
blood supply to the bowels. On this basis of reasoning I
treated the child's spine, and told the mother to report the

child was well.
The story possesses all of the features of all of the stories
that dramatize the cultist to his followers. Here are the sup
posedly fatal condition horribly pictured, the sudden revela
tion, and the immediate cure. What could be more naive
than this pushing about of heat and of cold? And what
story could be more ridiculous in the light of our present
knowledge of the causes of such conditions as apparently
afflicted the boy that Andrew Still describes? Indeed, if any
thing were lacking, it is promptly supplied in the next phase
of the story, namely, the alleged persecution of the prophet
by the citizenry of Macon, Missouri.
The apparently miraculous cure of the boy with diarrhea
naturally resulted in numerous calls for the services of the
adjuster, and he modestly admits that he treated many cases
with success. Here is his account of his subsequent persecu
tion:
I soon found myself in possession of a large practice. I was
not so much surprised to discover that all kinds of fevers,
summer and fall diseases could be cured without drugs as I
was to hear that a Methodist preacher had assembled my
brother's wife and children for the purpose of prayer. He
had turned fool, or was born that way (as many hurried
births have in all ages produced idiots), and the old theo
logical blank poured out his idiotic soul to the Lord; telling
him that my father was a good man and a saint in heaven,
while he was of the opinion that I was a hopeless sinner, and
had better have my wind taken away before I got any worse.
He stirred up a hurrah and hatred in Macon, which ran to
such a stage that those whom he could influence believed I
was crazy. Children gave me all the road, because I said I
did not believe God was a whisky and opium-drug doctor;
that I believed when He made man that He had put as many
legs, noses, tongues, and qualities as would be needed for
any purpose in life for either remedies or comfort. Because
of such arguments I was called an infidel, crank, crazy, and
God was advised by such theological hooting owls to kill me
and save the lambs.

OSTEOPATHY
The language of the prophet at its best is forceful. In the
heat of his ire Andrew decided to move; he departed for
Kirksville. "Long since Osteopathy has been given a big
welcome in Macon City," he says later. "They weep and
mourn because they did not know a true philosophy, and
help me build an infirmary there and make Macon the
Athens of learning, in the science of Osteopathy, instead of
the rival town in an adjoining county." So at Kirksville he
stayed, practicing osteopathy and teaching it to his four
sons. Finally in 1894 he secured the charter of the Ameri
can School of Osteopathy, the institution that was to deliver
upon the people of the United States some thousands of the
ignorant followers of the osteopathic system of diagnosing
and treating disease.
THE BASIC CONCEPTION OF OSTEOPATHY
The original divine revelation to Still was that the primary
cause of every disease is some interference with the blood
supply or nerve function, always caused by a dislocation
of one of the small bones which make up the spinal column.
This dislocation, he argued, brings about a change in the size
of the little openings between the bones, through which the
nerves and blood vessels pass. The result, according to Still,
is pressure on the nerves and blood vessels, and disease at
whatever distant point in the body the nerve or blood vessel
may lead to. But this primeval osteopathy, handed down
from heaven almost fifty years ago, was a somewhat different
osteopathy from that which exists today. The gradual de
parture from the original tenets by his followers was a dis
appointment to the inspired founder. In numerous lectures
delivered during 1894 and 1895 he remonstrated with them
for their growing heterodoxy, and in the Ladies' Home Jour
nal in 1908 he was still "believing . . . that the mechanical
displacement of the bony vertebrae constitutes most of the
lesions causing disease." But even in his own school in Kirks
ville, Missouri, students were soon being taught to take care
of a disturbance affecting the liver by adjusting the spinal
column first, then waiting a week, and then adjusting the

liver itself. Still was against all this. The arterial supply to
the organ was solely responsible for its health, he claimed,
and adjustment of the bones to release the arterial supply
would cure whatever disease beset it.
THE OSTEOPATH BRANCHES OUT
The modern osteopath, while still clinging warily to these
spinal adjustments, reaches out to embrace all that he can
of modern medicine. He attempts electrical treatment, water
treatment, massage, anesthesia, even surgery; and when the
Harrison and Volstead acts were passed he made desperate
efforts to secure the privilege of prescribing narcotics and
liquor. The simon-pure theory of Still denies flatly that
drugs may have any favorable effect on the course of dis
ease, but the modern osteopath is apparently convinced that
chloroform and ether will induce unconsciousness, that mor
phine and cocaine will relieve or deaden pain, and that the
fermented juice of the grape has certain agreeable effects
when administered in proper dosage, at proper times, and
to good ends. All this must be taken as evidence that the
osteopathy of today is essentially an attempt to enter the
practice of medicine by the back door.
CHANGES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION
There was a time when the standard of medical education
in the United States was a matter for despair. Half-educated
plowboys and section hands attended a few sessions of medi
cal lectures and burst forth in the regalia of the physician.
The medical schools were shambles. Scientific medicine
makes no secret of this; it glories, however, in the fact that
it did its own house-cleaning. In 1901, we reiterate, The
Journal of the American Medical Association, under the
editorship of Dr. George H. Simmons, began to publish the
appalling facts regarding American medical education. That
publication was like the finger of the housewife who writes
her name in the dust on the mantelpiece to show the maid
where to wipe. The organized medical profession promptly
appointed a special committee to investigate the medical

schools, to establish standards, and to hold the schools up to
those standards, once they were established. The weapon
used to achieve all this was publicity. School after school,
searched out and exposed, either met the standard or passed
into limbo. The number in this country dwindled from al
most two hundred to less than ninety. The proprietary medi
cal school, conducted for the pecuniary profit of the profes
sors, gave way to the endowed institution which spends on
the student far more than his fees. No longer was it possible
for those who could hardly read and write to emerge in two
years with a medical degree. The American M. D. of today
has had a high school education, two to four years of college
preparation, four years among the laboratories, lecture rooms
and clinics of a well-equipped medical school, and one or
two years enforced attendance as an interne in a standardized
hospital. Before he can minister to the sick in private prac
tice he must also pass a State examination. The route is a
long and difficult one. It is costly. That is one of the chief
reasons why there are now osteopaths and other such nonde
script healers.
But there are, of course, other reasons. With the advance
of medical research, the naive belief in pills and philters
with which the medical profession of the past was afflicted
met a crucial test. There came a nearer and nearer approach
to an actual science of medicine. Again the physicians did
their own house-cleaning. They created a Council on Phar
macy and Chemistry to examine the claims made for all
drugs, new and old, and to determine their actual virtues.
If what was offered could not pass the test, it was put into
an Index Expurgatorius and the facts were published. The
public, catching this spirit from the medical profession, be
gan to waver in its allegiance to powders and pills. It thus
became psychologically receptive to the claim of the drugless
healer that his "system" was superior to drugging. Many
such healers went even further. Still, for example, claimed
that drugs were not only of no value in the treatment of
disease, but even that they were responsible for most diseases.

"systems" OF MEDICINE
Let us pause here a moment to consider this matter of
"systems." If there is anything the normal American loves,
it is a "system." Consider the immense number offered to
him month in and month out in the advertising pages of his
favorite magazines: systems of mind training, house decorat
ing, salesmanship, motor repairing, mushroom growing,
health building, muscle building, eyesight training —systems
for everything. If you would see the preposterous lengths
to which the business may be carried in the pursuit of health,
study the pages of the popular physical culture magazines.
Now, scientific medicine offers no such system. It aims, by
the utilization of all available knowledge, to determine the
cause of disease, and then, by the use of all intelligent meth
ods, to benefit and heal the disease. It does not promulgate
any theory or principle to the exclusion of established facts.
It does not say, for example, that "all disease arises in the
spine and all disease can be healed by manipulating the
spine." Neither does it say that all disease arises in the mind
and can be removed by manipulating the mind. No doubt
the acceptance of such systems by what are said to be intelli
gent persons is based on the fact that while they are wholly
fallacious they are essentially simple. Even a moron knows
that when you remove the brake on a motor car the wheels
can go round. And when you tell him that there are brakes
in the spinal column which keep the blood from flowing
freely, or the nerves from functioning properly, he thinks
of the brake on the car, and is sure that the idea is right.
Imagine that same type of mind trying to understand how a
tubercle bacillus, which he has never seen and of which he
cannot conceive, makes a cavity within a human lung! As
for such matters as the way in which insulin acts to metabo
lize sugar in diabetes, or the way in which salvarsan controls
the insidious spirochaeta pallida —to explain these things
to him would be as hopeless as explaining the theory of the
well-advertised Professor Einstein. Scientific medicine ad

spine, and its practitioners treat the former by mind-healing
methods and frequently the latter by braces and supports
and other manipulative measures. But scientific medicine
does not treat an abscess of the liver by adjusting the back,
or a broken leg by attacking the mind. The great fallacy of
all the "systems" of disease and their healing lies in this
"all or nothing" policy. When that policy runs counter to
demonstrable facts the result is invariably disaster.
INTO MEDICINE BY THE BACK DOOR
It was the pride of Andrew Still that a number of States
had legally empowered the graduates of his school to prac
tice osteopathy. It is our thesis that osteopathy as it is prac
ticed today is essentially an attempt to get into the practice
of medicine by the back door. In 1917, for example, the
Supreme Court of Washington convicted a licensed osteo
path of practicing medicine without a license because he had
treated diseased tonsils by administering an anesthetic, plac
ing a snare around the tonsils, and cutting them out with a
knife, after which he administered stypticin to stop bleeding.
The court said:
A perusal of the successive catalogues of the schools of
osteopathy will show that their teachings are gradually being
expanded and that the more modern of them now teach in
some degree much that is taught in the older schools of medi
cine. The parent school has been more marked in this re
spect than perhaps any of them. It now teaches that in
childbirth lacerations, in certain types of congenital deform
ities, in certain kinds of tumors, etc., surgery must step in,
and that surgery must be resorted to for the removal of
tissues so badly diseased or degenerated that regeneration is
impossible by the process of adjustment. But this advance is
modern. In 1900, the time of the enactment of the medical
act, it was not in vogue.
In fact, the laws of the various States which have at
tempted to regulate osteopathy have had a hard time of it
to keep pace with the shifts of the osteopath in his attempt

to break into the practice of medicine. The Supreme Court
of California, for example, told an osteopath who wanted to
practice optometry that he was not licensed to fit glasses.
He argued that his license to practice osteopathy under the
medical practice act made him a physician and that the op
tometry law excepted duly licensed physicians. The Court
ruled that the law permitted him to practice osteopathy and
nothing more.
We have forty-eight States in the Republic and we have
forty-eight different medical practice acts. The Federal Gov
ernment encountered great difficulty in regulating the ad
ministration of narcotics because of this lack of uniformity.
In some States osteopathy is, by legal enactment, the practice
of medicine; in many others it is not. The Treasury Depart
ment, facing this conflict, became confused, and finally at
tempted to solve the problem by issuing the following order:
"Osteopaths should be permitted to register and pay special
tax under the provisions of the act of December 17, 1914,
provided they are registered as physicians or practitioners
under the laws of the State and affidavit to that effect is
made in the application for registration. . . ." But this deci
sion made the confusion worse than before. The word "prac
titioners" might include clairvoyants, Christian Scientists,
seventh sons of seventh sons, and all the motley crew that
prey on the weak and ailing. It might—and often did—in
clude osteopaths.
The evolution of osteopathic practice, as shown by these
and many other court decisions and departmental regula
tions, into something resembling the practice of actual medi
cine is probably the reason for the relatively slow develop
ment of the cult in the matter of numbers and for the out
growth from it of the malignant tumor, chiropractic, which
is apparently about to engulf the mother organism. Osteop
athy, growing complex and "scientific," ceases to meet the
demand for simplicity. Chiropractic falls into no such error.
It appears to be essentially a reversion to the original hypoth
esis of Andrew Still, so simple that even farm hands can
grasp it; indeed, an osteopath, viewing with alarm the in

roads of the new cult, has said that "chiropractic is the first
three weeks of osteopathy."
In 1908 the adherents of osteopathy claimed that the
mother school had graduated 2,765 students, that schools
merged with it had shed upon the community another 1,181,
and that there was a total of 3,946 osteopaths. According to
the United States Census, there were in the United States,
in 1920, about 5,030 osteopaths. There were at the same
time according to the same figures, 144,977 graduate physi
cians and surgeons, and 14,774 nondescript healers. Now, for
a population of about 105,000,000 persons, that is certainly
not a tremendous number of osteopaths. Apparently the
public is finding it possible to stagger along fairly well with
the attentions of the medical profession, which has been
steadily raising its standards of education. It is, indeed, a
confession of failure on the part of the cult that it should
have departed from its original hypothesis and gradually
embraced the adjustment of parts other than the spine, not
to mention the use of water, heat, and electricity, and of
anesthetics, antiseptics, and narcotics. In fact, a considerable
number of its practitioners have even adopted the extraor
dinary hocus-pocus of Albert Abrams as a part of their diag
nostic and therapeutic armamentarium. Imagine what anath
ema would have been hurled upon the latter group by
Andrew Still I How he would have ridiculed this apotheosis
of buncombe! At least there is something real about a jolt
applied with the thumb and finger to the back or directly to
the seat of a throbbing, inflamed organ. But think of what
Still would have said, in his peculiarly exalted language,
about the diagnosis of disease by hitching up a drop of blood
on a piece of blotting paper to a crude and confused mass of
electric wiring, connecting this inanimate, impossible elec
tric jumble to a strange subject, and then percussing areas
of dullness on this subject, and from them diagnosing
disease!
It was, indeed, a weakness of osteopathy that it had ambi
tions to be a science. When its schools increased their en

usually on the insistence by legislators in the form of strin
gent practice laws—and when they extended their hours of
study, the blacksmiths, barbers, motormen, and beauty spe
cialists who sought an easy road to healing turned by the
thousands to the chiropractic schools, which demanded no
preliminary education for matriculation and guaranteed a
diploma to any aspirant who could pay their fees.
THE LAXITY OF REGULATION
Scientific medicine possesses today adequate records of its
schools and its practitioners. In the offices of the American
Medical Association in Chicago are all the pertinent facts
about the medical colleges of the United States—the subjects
taught, the hours, the teachers, the pupils. There is a card
for every physician in America, and on it is recorded all that
is known concerning his qualifications. As one Southern
practitioner said on seeing the card devoted to his own
record: "Doctor, they've got things on that card that even
my wife don't know, and I've been a married man goin' on
forty years." Regularly all the medical schools are submitted
to a rigid inspection. But nobody knows anything for cer
tain about most of the osteopathic schools or osteopathic
practitioners. Even granting that the facts presented by the
schools themselves are reliable, hours of study do not neces
sarily mean hours of training. Truth and scientific facts are
not guaranteed by the time spent in instruction but by the
reliability of the subject matter taught. And what of the
training of the teachers in the colleges of osteopathy: is it
perhaps a case of the blind leading the blind? The truth of
the osteopathic theory as to the causation of disease has
never, of course, been established. If diphtheria bacilli of
sufficient virulence and dosage are placed on the membranes
of the throat of animal or man, the result is diphtheria. In
their absence, no possible dislocation or distortion of bones,
muscles, ligaments, blood vessels, or nerves will bring about
that result.

OSTEOPATHY
FAILURES IN SCIENTIFIC DIAGNOSIS
Here are two quotations from a report written by the edi
tor of an osteopathic magazine; they refer to the death of
his own son:
Billie had diphtheria four days before we knew what he
had. . . . I had never seen a case of diphtheria before; never
even thought of looking at his throat. . . . Dr. was
called the fourth day and diagnosed the trouble at once. He
is an M.D.; has had wide experience; has had the training so
many of us have not had.
And then later:
I don't understand antitoxin; I can't understand how a
poison can cure disease or neutralize poisons. Yet when the
death rate is cut from 50 per cent to 10 per cent, isn't it best
to be a physician first, and an osteopath second?
Osteopathy, chiropractic, Coueism, Christian Science,
every system of healing without regard to established fact,
comes a cropper when confronted with the established proof
of the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. The
case of Billie is an exposure of the fallacy that an individual
may be safely permitted to practice a single branch of medi
cine without first undergoing complete instruction in all
the fundamentals of medical science. But when the incom
petent undergoes such a complete course of instruction there
is revealed to him, alas, the underlying lack of truth in the
"system" or cult to which he has been addicted!
Physicians see almost daily in their practice the results
of patients peddling their ailments among the variegated as
sortment of peculiar practitioners. Perhaps none of the cases
which might be cited is more striking than the one described
by a well-known Eastern neurologist:
Recently I examined a boy, age 17, lying in bed, very
weak, extremely emaciated, totally blind, barely able to
swallow. The ophthalmoscope (the instrument which the
physician uses to look into the back of the eye) revealed

history of the case is briefly: failing vision over nine months
in the spring and summer of 1920, very severe headaches and
frequent attacks of vomiting, often when there was no food
in the stomach, and repeatedly convulsive seizures limited to
the right leg without loss of consciousness. It was easy to
make a diagnosis of brain tumor; but the condition of the
patient was such that surgical interference was out of the
question. The diagnosis, which seemed perfectly clear, might
easily have been made many months ago. The condition of
the patient for many months was certainly grave and alarm
ing, and might have suggested to anyone that it needed
thorough investigation. During all these months, while the
vision was fading and blindness coming on, what did the
boy receive? Treatment by an osteopath and then a chiro
practor, and then treatment by another peculiar practitioner
and still another practitioner, and so on, but never an
ophthalmoscopic examination.
THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF STILL
The autobiography of Andrew Still was published in 1897;
it is a true piece of Americana, remarkable for the crudeness
of its style, its florid diction, its religious frenzy and exalta
tion. It closes with testimonials and tributes solemn and
poetical. But in order to get at a little more of the true in
wardness of the man, one must consult some of his biog
raphers of the osteopathic faith. "Practically, Dr. Still is a
spiritualist," says E. R. Booth. And J. H. Sullivan writes: "I
think the most beautiful thought Dr. Still ever gave voice to
was that in which he said he believed each red corpuscle in
the blood had an intelligence all its own, else how can one
explain the fact of a certain red corpuscle journeying on and
on, say in a peacock's tail feathers, and finally adding to the
particular color, which we know to be a physiological fact."
Thus may a master dispenser of hokum inspire his followers.
It is not surprising to find that Andrew Still believed him
self possessed of mystical powers. "There are scores of well
attested instances in which Dr. Still has shown his power of
clairvoyance—perhaps it would be better to say telepathy,"
says E. R. Booth. "In the case of Dr. Still he seems to have

inherited this power, if such a thing is possible, from both
sides of his family. . . . Most persons who have spent even
a short time in Kirksville have heard stories of his power to
divine what was taking place elsewhere."
Like many another prophet of healing Andrew Still was
eccentric in his habits and in his dress. "Dr. A. T. Still, or
as he was familiarly called by those who knew him best, the
Old Doctor, was never a very particular man about his dress,
or perhaps, it would be nearer the truth to say that he was
usually very careless about his personal appearance," says
one of his followers. "This seems to be a characteristic of
nearly all geniuses." Still, it appears, was fully conscious of
the impression made by his habits of attire. While working
at one time in front of his house, repairing the brick walk,
he was accosted by two ladies who asked him if Dr. Still
was at home. He replied in the affirmative and they stated
their request to see the doctor. "If you want to see Dr. Still
look at me," the great osteopath said, "but if you want to see
a fifty dollar suit of clothes and a 'plug hat,' Mother will
show them to you, if you will step in the house."
As has been seen he resembled all other leaders of healing
cults in his impatience with believers in other "systems" of
healing, and he saw no good in any religion except his own.
"If because I denounce drugs you call me a Christian Scien
tist," he said, "go home and take half a glass of castor oil
and purge yourself of such notions." "Every advance step
in Osteopathy," he said on another occasion, "leads one to
greater veneration of the Divine Ruler of the universe." And
he resented seriously any insinuation that osteopathy ob
tained its effects only in so far as it was a system of massage.
As to this he said:
Osteopathy absolutely differs from massage. The definition
of 'Massage' is masso, to knead: shampooing of the body by
special manipulations such as kneading, tapping, stroking,
etc. The masseur rubs and kneads the muscles to increase
the circulation. The Osteopath never rubs. He takes off any
pressure on blood-vessels or nerves by the adjustment of any
displacement, whether it be of a bone, cartilage, ligament,

tendon, muscle, or even of the fascia which enfolds all struc
tures; also by relaxing any contracture of muscle or ligament
due to displacements, to drafts causing colds, to overwork or
nerve exhaustion.
That was the final pronouncement from the osteopathic
Athens of America.
MODERN OSTEOPATHY
Today osteopathy concerns itself with the general practice
of medicine. Essentially the osteopath is a physician who
has come into practice by the back door. In addition to prac
ticing medicine, the osteopath believes that he adjusts what
he calls osteopathic lesions. These lesions are presumably
abnormalities consisting of slight displacements of the sur
faces of the bones at the points where they touch. The osteo
path believes that he finds these by feeling the bones, by
looking at them, by using the x-ray, and by the patient's
own indication of local tenderness. The actual fact of the
matter is that, in most instances, these dislocations are not
present and, even if they were present, they would not cause
the symptoms that are accredited to them.
The osteopath feels that these lesions are associated with
diseases in various organs, but he is likely to find the same
lesion for all of the different diseases that might concern any
one organ. For example, a kidney can be affected by inflam
mation by Bright's disease, by tuberculosis, by the presence
of an abscess, or by a tumor. But the osteopath would find
the same trouble in the spine for all of these conditions.
It is, therefore, quite likely that what is called the osteo
pathic lesion exists only in the mind of the adjuster, and
that the manipulations used by the osteopath to correct such
lesions represent essentially enhancement of the power of
suggestion by the laying on of hands. That idea, as has pre
viously been said, was well known even in Biblical times.
The very cases in which, to the patient, osteopathy seems
to offer most relief are those in which the patient has some
chronic disorder which has not yielded readily to any treat

merit, or those in which the condition is benefited by mas
sage and stimulation of the circulation.
Of late, the osteopaths have sought to gain a foothold
abroad but their notions have seemed to offer but little ap
peal to the stolid inhabitants of Great Britain and Germany.
RECENT STATISTICS OF OSTEOPATHY
Of particular interest is the recent investigation made by
the Committee on the Costs of Medical Care. This Commit
tee finds that there are some 7,650 osteopaths practicing in
the United States, distributed largely in the Far West, Cali
fornia having the greatest number relative to population,
with twenty osteopaths to every hundred thousand inhabi
tants as contrasted with a ratio for the whole United States
of six for every hundred thousand inhabitants. California is
the osteopathic paradise. In Los Angeles an osteopath is as
good as a doctor and he doesn't care who knows it. In fact,
he is likely to consider himself much better.
The osteopathic group have a portion of the County Hos
pital which they conduct but, fortunately for the sick, those
with serious illness are likely to be assigned to the medical
division, thereby increasing the mortality rates in that divi
sion and giving the osteopaths opportunity to crow because
of the lower death rates in their own division. When health
ful patients are primarily selected as the basis for medical
care by any group, that group is certain to show excellent
mortality rates.
Incidentally, the osteopaths are much more numerous in
towns and small cities than are physicians. They are absent
from rural communities and from large cities. The reasons
should be obvious. The old laws of supply and demand work
immutably. In the large city the osteopath is compelled to
meet the opposition of an excellent and well established
medical profession. The rural community confronts him with
medical emergencies for which his education in no way pre
pares him. Hence, he locates in the small town where the
old, chronic cases of rheumatism and what have you are
willing to surrender themselves to his tender mercies.

FADS AND QUACKERY IN HEALING
In 1930 there were still seven osteopathic schools in the
United States. In 1927 there were eight. Osteopathic schools,
being dependent largely on the incomes from students for
their continuance, come and go. Proprietary medical schools
have disappeared since the cost of educating a physician is
so great in proportion to what students can pay that there
is no money in running a sound institute for medical edu
cation.
Since 1900 the osteopaths have gradually reached out and
helped themselves to most of the therapeutic measures used
by medicine. One osteopath discovered obstetrics. It had
been going on for many centuries, but he figured he might
sit by the bedside and wait as well as a physician or a mid
wife. Hence, obstetrics became a part of the osteopathic
curriculum.
Another osteopath in the State of Washington discovered
that the tonsils could be reached by anyone with a hook, and
he began to jerk tonsils from their resting place in the throat.
However, the State of Washington, through its Supreme
Court, rendered a decision which prevented him, at least
briefly, from embarking into surgery.
Nevertheless, once the osteopath is in practice, he tries to
become a physician. A survey of medical facilities in Phila
delphia showed that at least fifty per cent of osteopaths were
vaccinating people against smallpox, and twenty per cent
were immunizing against diphtheria. Today all of the osteo
pathic colleges teach the use of vaccines, antitoxins, and simi
lar preparations; whereas but ten years ago the editor of the
osteopathic journal permitted his son to die of diphtheria
without giving him a dose of antitoxin.
At a recent convention of osteopaths the dean of one col
lege urged that osteopaths admit frankly that they are now
embracing materia medica and really practicing medicine.
Since this is the case, the public needs to be concerned with
seeing to it that osteopathy does not continue to be a means
of getting into medicine by the back door. Osteopaths should
be compelled to meet the same requirements that physicians
are compelled to meet. Indeed, there should be a minimum

standard of education for all who propose to heal the sick,
regardless of the names which they give themselves or the
system which they think they are practicing.
Most of the states in this country specifically provide for
the practice of osteopathy. These laws fix minimum educa
tional qualifications, provide for special boards of examiners,
and define the limitations under which osteopaths may prac
tice. No two states have laws exactly the same, and in many
states osteopaths have been sufficiently influential to secure
for themselves practically unlimited scope.
In point of numbers, as is pointed out by Dr. Louis S.
Reed in his report to the Committee on the Costs of Medi
cal Care, the growth of osteopathy has practically stopped.
The reasons for its failure to grow are two: First, it has
ceased to be a medical cult and is merely low grade medi
cine; second, its place as a medical cult has been taken by
chiropractic. As will be revealed in the next chapter, chiro
practic was called by an osteopath a tumor on osteopathy
which would inevitably engulf the mother organism.
In the practice of medicine as a whole an osteopath cannot
compete with a properly trained physician. When he tries
to compete he indulges in claims which mark him as a quack
and a charlatan. Dr. Reed believes that the osteopaths
merely dilute the quality of medical care available to the
people of this country. The people should weigh well the
question of whether they care to submit themselves and
their families to substandard medical care.
WHY PEOPLE GO TO OSTEOPATHS
Well, why do people go to osteopaths anyway? Don't they
ever help anybody? People go to osteopaths because they
have been directly approached through advertising, in which
reputable physicians do not indulge. They go because some
friend who has been aided by an osteopath, or thinks he has,
has urged them to go. They go when physicians have failed
them. Ah! yes. I grant you freely that physicians fail. There
are diseases in which science can be of but little service, and
if the doctor is honest he will tell you so. I know a woman

progressing case of paralysis agitans or shaking palsy. Three
eminent neurologists told her ten years ago that her condi
tion was incurable; they prescribed a simple regime of life
and told her to save her money for the invalidism of her
remaining years. But during the intervening years she has
spent every cent of her income on massage, on electric treat
ment, on nature cures, and on osteopathy, and she is un
doubtedly worse. And I am willing to admit that among
those who treated her was a physician who should have
known better. The incompetent or unprincipled physician,
licensed to practice medicine by a too complaisant State, is
the greatest menace to scientific medicine— as great a men
ace as all the cultists put together.
Osteopathic or any other kind of manipulation undoubt
edly produces, at times, temporary benefit, or the feeling of
benefit. The old-time physician used to put his hands on the
patient; he used to work him up a bit, while at the same
time he encouraged him mentally. There are many who feel
that the modern physician might practice a little more of
this laying on of hands. But it does not require any extraor
dinary mentality to see how serious it is to practice merely
the laying on of hands and the conferring of a temporary
feeling of benefit when a child is beginning to strangle with
the accumulated debris of a diphtheritic membrane, or when
the life of a woman is being slowly sapped by an internal,
malignant tumor, or when some previously uncautious man
is beginning to show the first signs of paralysis and the delu
sions of grandeur associated with an early encounter with
the spirochaeta pallida of syphilis. These are surely no times
for the laying on of hands; these are times for accurate diag
nosis, and the speedy administration of the life-saving diph
theria antitoxin, the merciful surgical knife, and the de
stroyers of spirochetes: mercury and salvarsan.
In 1875, when Andrew Still went from Kansas to Kirks-
ville, he found a letter addressed to his brother Edward
from another brother, the Rev. James M. Still of Eudora,
Kansas, "stating that I was crazy, had lost my mind and

supply of truth-loving manhood." Still's comment on this
letter, taken from his autobiography, offers a remarkable
sidelight on the motives of the founder of osteopathy. "I read
it," says Still, "and thought, 'As the eagle stirreth up her
nest, so stir away, Jim, till your head lets down some of the
milk of reason into some of the starved lobes of your brain.'
I believed Jim's brain would ripen in time, so I let him
pray, until at the end of eighteen years he said: 'Hallelujah,
Drew, you are right; there is money in
it,
and

VIII
CHIROPRACTIC
"Men are usually competent thinkers along the lines of their special
ized training only. Within these limits alone are their opinions and
judgments valuable; outside of these limits they grope and are lost—
usually without knowing it."—Mark Twain.
"npHE spine is a series of bones running down your back.
-I-
You sit on one end of it and your head sits on the
other." A simple definition and one that
is
sufficient for the
average man! But there
is
much more to the spine than that.
If you don't believe it, ask any chiropractor. In
a
glib and
rhythmical manner that indicates hours of study of what the
salesmen call
a
selling talk he will tell you things about the
spine that will astonish you. Imagine, then, the astonishment
of scientific anatomists, physiologists, pathologists, and physi
cians when these amazing views of the spine were first
launched upon them by Andrew Still, the founder of osteop
athy! It was only later that they were adopted by the
chiropractors and elaborated into
a
comprehensive system
of pseudomedicine.
About 1894, or some twenty years after osteopathy first
saw the light, the following incident occurred in Davenport,
Iowa. The story was told under oath on the witness stand
by B.
J.
Palmer, high priest of chiropractic and son of D. D.
Palmer, its founder:
Harvey Lillard was
a
janitor in the building in which
father had his office at that time, in the Ryan Block at Dav
enport. Harvey came in one day thoroughly deaf. Father
asked him how long he had been deaf, and he told him

seventeen years. Father said, "How did this occur?" Harvey
said, "I was in a stooped, cramped position, and while in
that position I felt something pop, and heard it crack in my
back." Father looked him over, laid him down on the cot,
and there was a great subluxation on the back. Harvey
said he went deaf within two minutes after that popping
occurred in the spine, and had been deaf ever since, seven
teen years. Father reasoned out the fundamental thought of
this thing, which was that if something went wrong in the
back and caused deafness, the reduction of that subluxation
would cure it. That bump was adjusted, was reduced, and
within ten minutes Harvey had his hearing and has had it
ever since. He is now janitor in the City Hall in Davenport.
This little tale is inserted that the reader may see just
how much credit is given to osteopathy by chiropractic for
the idea on which the latter system, like the former, rests.
As for Harvey Lillard's deafness—if it was not imaginary —
one can only surmise that it was of that order known as
hysterical deafness, not due to any organic defect, and cur
able, as thousands of such cases always have been cured, by
any strong suggestion, including the laying on of hands. The
osteopaths will tell you that chiropractic is the first three
weeks of osteopathy; the chiropractors will insist that there
are vital differences between the original tenets of osteo
pathy and chiropractic, but no neutral student has ever been
able to discover those differences. The younger Palmer told
on the witness stand how his father, confronted with his
experience in the case of Harvey Lillard, arrived by pure
logic at the conception of chiropractic. But there is some
evidence that the elder Palmer, while practicing as a mag
netic healer, also had opportunity to witness the demonstra
tions of old Dr. Still. So much for the founding of chiro

the brake pressing on the nerve as it emerges from the spinal
column keeps the nerve from transmitting the energy that
makes the wheels of the body go round properly, the victim
is impressed by what he calls "reason." Unfortunately for
this "reason," the fundamental facts will not support it. A
brake and a wheel are material objects that can be observed;
the spinal column and the nerves that emerge from it are
also material objects, but they cannot usually be observed.
A man tries the brakes on his car and finds that they catch
hold and the wheels stop. But let something go wrong under
the hood of his car, in some of the internal workings that
are beyond his ken, and he will have to take the word of an
expert for the fact that the thing is wrong that the expert
says is wrong. There have been, as we all know, motor me
chanics who were not above taking a little advantage of the
car owner's ignorance of its internal mechanism. There are
also body mechanics who do not appear to be above taking
advantage of the layman's ignorance of the anatomy of his
spinal column.
The nerves that emerge from the spinal column are much
smaller than the holes between the bones of the column
from which they emerge. The space about the nerve is
padded with fat and soft tissue. The back may be bent into
all sorts of angles and postures —everyone has seen the acro
batic dancer of the stage assume such angles —and yet these
nerves are not squeezed or damaged because of the padding
with which nature has protected them. Professors of anat
omy have dissected thousands of dead bodies and have been
unable to find any spinal nerves pinched or compressed in
the manner which chiropractors allege is responsible for dis
ease. The X-ray has been used to search for the dislocations
which the chiropractors assert are present, but those dislo
cations cannot be found. Indeed, substances opaque to the
X-ray have been injected into the canal within the spinal
column, and photographs taken later have shown the fluid
passing around the nerves in a manner that would be impos
sible if these nerves were impinged on by the bony struc
tures with which they are surrounded. Today this method

is used to locate accurately tumors of the spine. Moreover,
experiments conducted in California have shown that a force
of 1,200 to 1,300 pounds, while it will fracture one of the
spinal bones, will not dislocate it or cause it to press on the
spinal nerves. Thus the fundamental dogma of chiropractic,
that disease is caused by dislocations or subluxations of the
bones of the spinal column, pressing on nerves, is simply a
complete misrepresentation of the demonstrable facts. Any
chiropractor who tells an invalid that he is ill for that rea
son is either willingly deluding the patient or deluding him
self.
The action in the chiropractor's office is usually some
thing like the following:
Patient: Are you the doctor?
Chiropractor: I am the doctor. And what's the little
difficulty today?
Patient: Well, doc, it's this rheumatism I've been suffer-
in' with.
(Of course it may be a cold, or a sore throat, or diph
theria, or diabetes, or almost anything else that has already
been diagnosed, or that the patient, in his rough and ready
manner, has essayed to diagnose.)
Chiropractor: Well, strip off your things and get into
the kimono.
Patient: How much are the treatments, doc?
Chiropractor: Two dollars.
Patient (Stripped, so far, of clothes only) : All right.
Chiropractor: Well, I should say so. (Rapidly runs
fingers up and down patient's back.) Why, here's a subluxa
tion of the third, fifth, and ninth, and almost a lateral curva
ture. (The figures might just as well be first, seventh, and
twelfth.) Get up here.
(The patient mounts a leather-covered board with pillows
at each end, that depresses the spine. The patient is already
beginning to feel depressed. Then the chiropractor gives the

as the Chiropractic Thrust.)
Patient: Go a little easy there, doc.
Chiropractor: We've got to get these little dislocations
back into place. Now turn over on your back. (The chiro
practor now jerks the patient's head until his neck cracks or
pulls his leg, depending on the particular school of chiro
practic in which he was instructed.)
Patient: Doc, I heard that crack. I think I feel better.
Chiropractor: Well, yours is a pretty difficult case. Those
bones may slip out again. It may take a series of treatments.
Lessee, this is Chuesday; come in about Thoisday. Yeh, make
it Thoisday an' bring a kimono. I'll give you a locker for it.
Yes, two dollars for the treatment an' a dollar rental for the
locker.
Thus chiropractic diagnosis and treatment. Disease is
caused by certain bones of the spine impinging on certain
nerves. Disease is cured by pushing those bones off those
nerves until by some unknown mechanism of physiology
they are persuaded to stay off.
THE CHIROPRACTIC FOUNTAINHEAD
The "fountainhead" of chiropractic is at Davenport, Iowa,
and B. J. Palmer is its prophet. It is not always well to go
directly to an individual for an evaluation of his attain
ments, but Palmer explained his on the witness stand some
years ago. We may accept the record as representing the
most that he could give himself. On December 22, 1910, a
chiropractor was placed on trial in Milwaukee, and Palmer
appeared in his behalf. In the course of his testimony,
Palmer told the court that he had learned chiropractic from
his father, that he was at the time of testifying twenty-eight
years of age, and that at the age of twelve he was in the
field as a practitioner of this strange art. He had attended
common grade school at Davenport, Iowa. He said in one
place, "At the age of eleven I was kicked from home, forced
to make my living," and in another that his education had
been chiefly "common sense" and "horse reasoning." Be

yond that he had "graduated from the Palmer School of
Chiropractic under my father" and had "studied art some in
Chicago, not very long . . . landscape work, painting . . .
I have studied music."
Now as a result of all this delving into knowledge, with
what degree did Palmer decorate himself in the annual an
nouncements of his college? It appeared that he had the
degrees of D. C. and Ph. C., conferred by the Palmer School
of Chiropractic, which he owned. And after his name ap
peared: "Is a student, author, lecturer and teacher on any
phase of chiropractic philosophy, science or art anywhere
any time." He was also described as the developer of the
philosophy, science and art of chiropractic; author of many
volumes on the science, art, and philosophy of chiropractic;
secretary and philosophical counsel to the Universal Chiro
practors' Association, honorary member of the German-
American Chiropractors' Association, secretary of the Iowa
Chiropractors' Association, counsel for the P. S. C. (Palmer
School of Chiropractic) , and manager and assistant editor of
the Chiropractor. And it was further said of him that "one
of his aims in life is to be a Therapeutical Idol Shatterer"
and "destroyer of superstitious ideas regarding man, and re-
placer of practical studies."
From the evidence in the case cited it became quite clear
that in the Palmer School, as conducted by the elder Palmer,
anyone could embark on the study of chiropractic. It was
not even necessary that he be able to read and write. The
standard, by 1910, was higher. No primary education was
required, but B. J. Palmer said that "each student must
have a brain and know how to use it." Every student was
required to spend twelve months, totaling twenty-seven hun
dred hours, in the college before he got a diploma. If he
passed his examinations with a degree of 98 per cent, he was
awarded the degree of Ph. C. But when Dr. Thomas F.
Duhigg reported the results of an inspection of the schools
of Davenport for the Pennsylvania Bureau of Medical Edu
cation and Licensure he pointed out that in 1915 the three

were really little fit to educate anybody in anything. None
had a library, a hospital, a laboratory worthy of the name,
post-mortems, or capable teachers. To these institutions came
students without preliminary education, and after one year

of lecture halls and demonstration rooms, they were turned
loose to minister to the sick.
Low as were the requirements of the fountainhead school
and some of its Iowa offshoots, chiropractic colleges estab
lished by exploiters in other states were not even one half so

its writing and general appearance of having come from an
ignorant and illiterate woman, was sent from a town in
Texas to the Carver Chiropractic College in Oklahoma City:

formed kindly but firmly that she was obviously not the pos
sessor of sufficient fundamental learning to warrant her un
dertaking the diagnosing and treating of human ailments as
a life occupation. The Carver Chiropractic College, however,
was in no way subject to any qualms. After all, two thou
sand dollars is not to be sneezed at. Following is the Carver
reply:
Dear Madam: Your most interesting letter stating that you
were very much interested in the study of the subject of
Chiropractic and reciting the incidence (Sic!) leading to the
death of your husband and the information that you had re
ceived from some of your Chiropractic Doctor friends that
his death was all unnecessary, had a Chiropractic Doctor
waited on him instead of an M.D. I think you are entirely
correct, however, that is an incidence (Sic!) That is a con
dition we must all meet. While it grieves us to give up the
ones we love, your husband showed forethought in providing
for you in a way and I can not think of a better means to
put your money to than preparing yourself for a real life's
work.
Chiropractic is a profession based upon a science. While
your education may be limited you have the intelligence and
the determination and sufficient education to understand the
English language you would have no difficulty in getting a
knowledge of this subject so that you could go out and
practice and be efficient. You can enter at any time and in
eighteen months, upon making your grades, can be gradu
ated. If you can come at once it will be well for you to do
so, but if not, make your arrangements to be here sure by
the first Monday in April. Living conditions here are very
reasonable. You will find no difficulty in getting good and
economical living quarters. We will do what we can to help
you when you come. You will find the student body a fine
working, virile body. Oklahoma City is a city of 125,000
which offers the advantages of a city of this size and you will
enjoy life while here.
I am sending you a catalogue under separate cover which
will give you all the information I have not given you in
this letter.

FADS AND QUACKERY IN HEALING
Trusting that we will hear from you or see you in a short
time, I am.
Very truly,
Carver Chiropractic College
H. E. Thompson.
It would be possible to marshal innumerable examples
of the crudity of chiropractic literature. An analysis of any
considerable mass of this material reveals at once the fact
that such of it as is sound from a grammatical point of view
is florid with the phraseology of the writer of modern ad
vertising blurbs; that which has not had such censorship is
almost invariably full of misspelled words and specimens of
grammar that would excite the derision of a fifth grade
scholar from any elementary school. The acme of chiro
practic diction was no doubt reached in the following defi
nition which constitutes a part of the act regulating chiro
practic signed in 1920 by the Governor of New Jersey.
Definition of Chiropractic: The term chiropractic
when used in this act shall be construed to mean and be the
name given to the study and application of a universal phi
losophy of biology, theology, theosophy, health, disease,
death, the science of the cause of disease and art of permit
ting the restoration of the triune relationships between all
attributes necessary to normal composite forms, to har
monious quantities and qualities by placing in juxtaposition
the abnormal concrete positions of definite mechanical por
tions with each other by hand, thus correcting all sublux
ations of the articulations of the spinal column, for the pur
pose of permitting the recreation of all normal cyclic
currents through nerves that were formerly not permitted to
be transmitted, through impingement, but have now assumed
their normal size and capacity for conduction as they ema
nate through intervertebral forramina —the expressions of
which were formerly excessive or partially lacking —named
disease.
When Dr. George Dock visited the fountainhead of chiro
practic in 1921, he found the business of training practi
tioners of chiropractic a most flourishing one. Palmer's orig

inal plant had expanded into a series of buildings devoted
to the teaching of some three thousand aspirants annually, at
a cost of several hundred dollars each. But the large build
ings, Dock reported, were still not devoted to teaching any
of the fundamental facts of physiology, pathology, bacteriol
ogy, or even hygiene and sanitation. There were classrooms
seating from 300 to 500 students in which the lecture
method was used to force home the ideas of B. J. Palmer,
Mrs. Palmer, and their colleagues of the faculty. The walls
bore trite epigrams and aphorisms earnestly beseeching the
students to give ear to the words of the prophet. There were
a cafeteria, a printing plant, a private branch post office and
express service, a room containing specimens of bone lesions,
and a roof garden. More recently there has been established
Station WOC, which radios chiropractic philosophy to pros
pective patients, the while it dispenses the usual form of
aerial entertainment. This station is more egregious in its
splendor, Harry Hansen informs me, than anything he has
seen except the station conducted by Roxy in New York.
It would seem that the chiropractic course has now length
ened —presumably with the advance in chiropractic knowl
edge—to three years of six months each, although arrange
ments may still be made to take the whole eighteen months
straight through. In this course, alleged to be of 5,335 class
hours, the student is taught the philosophy of chiropractic,
how to use the chiropractic thrust, how to adjust patients,
something about obstetrics, and more about salesmanship.
With from three to five thousand students annually paying
from I350 to $500 each, it can be readily seen that the busi
ness does not exactly lose money.
Consider now the length of the terms of the ordinary
medical school, the expensive equipment of its laboratories,
and its large staff of professors in the various fundamental
branches and medical specialties. At once it will be realized
why the medical school requires State or philanthropic sup
port for its maintenance, and why the ignorant and un
equipped aspirant who wants to embark on a career of heal
ing will choose chiropractic, with its eighteen months of

lectures, instead of medicine with its preliminary high school
and college education, its four years in the medical school,
and its one to two years of interneship in a hospital. Inci
dentally, in the medical schools, there is no course in sales
manship.
As may well be imagined, chiropractors have multiplied.
And as they have multiplied, so also have chiropractic
schools. In 1920 B. J. Palmer made a speech at a convention
of chiropractors in Butte, Montana. The astute B. J. was a
little incautious, or perhaps the wine of fame had gone a
little to his head. For he said:
Our school back at Davenport is established on a business
and not a professional basis. It is a business where we manu
facture chiropractors. They have got to work just like ma
chinery. A course of salesmanship goes along with their
training. We teach them the idea and then we show them
how to sell it.
This phase of chiropractic education has become more and
more important. Indeed, advertising concerns have been
formed for no other purpose than to aid the chiropractor in
reaching his prospective patients. One such organization in
Indiana is frank:
To advertise inside the chiropractic, medical and truth
laws, requires some adroitness, some ingenuity of expression,
some more than common ability as a wordsmith.
The advertising matter of the exponents of the chiro
practic art has provided amusement to thousands since first
it burst upon the American scene. In 1921 the Idaho Falls
Times-Register displayed the announcement of the Busby
Chiropractic Specialists. It was headed in black-faced type:
"Why His Wife Left Him." It told of the case of one Jack
who "never had a smile for his wife" and "was grouchy with
the baby." Mrs. Jack thought he had ceased to love her be
cause he desired to sleep alone. As a matter of fact, the
Busby Chiropractors inform us, he did love her "but, due
to nerve pressure in the spinal column, he was not normal
sexually." Mrs. Jack did not know this and in time she left

him. "A happy home could have been made if he had gone
to the Busby Chiropractic Specialists and had those verte
brae adjusted to normal."
The pleasant little item that has been cited appeared on
the "Society and Personal" page of the paper as being, per
haps, especially suitable for home reading. It is matched
only by the chiropractic testimonial for which the Chicago
Tribune vouches:
Dear Doctor. —Before taking Chiropractic and Electric
treatments, I was so nervous that nobody could sleep with
me. After taking six treatments anybody can sleep with me.
A few years ago the press made much of the story of the
"talking girl" of Waukegan who had been cured after talk
ing seven days and nights. Medical practitioners, it was
stated, had failed and then the chiropractor had achieved a
successful result. It made a good newspaper story, especially
for those newspapers that saw in it the opportunity to sug
gest to the chiropractic fraternity that their business had
been given a magnificent boost in the news column, and
that it was highly desirable that they should add to this free
advertising momentum an additional urge through the ad
vertising pages. Rate card enclosed! Briefly, the child did
not suffer from so-called "talking sickness"; the alleged ad
justment of the spine did not "cure" the "sickness" and,
finally, the child had not completely recovered. The case
was one of epidemic encephalitis, with a temperature rang
ing between 99 and 103 and active delirium, inequality of
the pupils, and strabismus. The improvement was gradual
and that incident to the ordinarily observed progress of the
disease. As shown by the case record, the chiropractor's
"treatment" did not modify the course of the disease. The
"talking" had ceased at intervals previous to his visit and
continued at intervals after his "treatment." But the pub
licity given the case offered great opportunities for adver
tising, and advertising is an important part of the chiro
practic curriculum. In fact, the child never completely re
covered from the disease.

FADS AND QUACKERY IN HEALING
CHIROPRACTIC ORGANIZATION
It is an aphorism that where there is money there is power.
Expensive legal organizations were early established for tak
ing care of the chiropractor who fell afoul of the laws gov
erning the healing art. Funds were established for releasing
him when he chanced to be the victim of an enforced rest
behind the bars. The usual committees for lobbying protec
tive legislation through State and national legislative bodies
began to function —and it must be said for them that they
have functioned efficiently in most cases. Already chiroprac
tic is legally established in many States, and apparently im
mune to prosecution in those where it still flourishes with
out legal warrant.
In the meantime, B. J. has not been idle. His fertile mind
saw that chiropractic must grow if it was to survive. In 1910
he testified that he would not adjust the vertebra of a dog
for a stomach-ache or yelping at night. "I think I would use
a shotgun in that case," said B. J. But in 1921, chiropractors
were adjusting mules that refused to get up and cows that
were somewhat swelled. But in this bright land of the free
trifling with the health of the animal seems to be a much
more serious matter than offering treatment to one's fellow
citizens. Chiropractic veterinarianism has not yet become
popular.
Those who have taken at least a casual interest in medical
quackery will remember that one Albert Abrams, of Cali
fornia, some years before his death propounded an entirely
new method of diagnosing and treating disease, the same
having to do with certain vibrations, currents and ohms,
and a mumbo jumbo of pseudoelectrical nomenclature. The
osteopaths, struggling against the flood of chiropractic sew
age which threatened to engulf them, saw in the Abrams
method an opportunity for a new lease of life. Many osteo
paths hailed its coming with shrieks of happiness, both in
the public press and directly to their clientele. And the ex
ceedingly clever Dr. Abrams, knowing the superior flavor
that attaches to exclusiveness, announced early in his exploi

tation of the "oscilloclast" and the other oscillating devices
with which his name was connected, that their use would be
limited to physicians and osteopaths. The humble chiro
practor was to be excluded.
Now, the astute B. J. Palmer is not averse to taking a leaf
from some other man's book. As has been mentioned, his
esteemed ancestor, the magnetic healer, adopted certain prin
ciples promulgated by Dr. Andrew Still. So B. J. suddenly
appeared on the horizon with a little device of his own
called the "neurocalometer" —"the little wonder instrument
which so accurately locates impinged nerves." B. J. is too
wise to discard chiropractic ideas in favor of any theory of
vibrations, and thus to sacrifice the identity of his hereditary
science. But he does develop "a little wonder instrument"
to put on the spine to tell the chiropractor where to do his
pushing. In a letter issued from the chiropractic fountain-
head on December 15, 1924, a prospective student was urged
to enroll promptly in order to take advantage of current
prices on this device:
The neurocalometer is not sold, but is leased for a period
of ten years. As you may know, the original lease price for
ten years was $620, soon increased to $1,200, later to $1,500,
and then to the present price of $2,200, with the prospect of
an increase at an early date to $3,000.
But if the aspirant for chiropractic honors would enroll
in the January, 1925, class at Davenport (either cash or
deferred payment) , he was told, he could get a neurocalom
eter with his diploma, or even six months later at the cur
rent lease price. All he had to do was to pay $200 down and
then $50 a month for sixteen months. The neurocalometer
is simply one of those sensitive little electrothermal devices
called thermopiles which produce a weak electrical current
with any change of temperature. B. J. says it shows such a
change when the nerve coming out of the hole in the spinal
column is being pressed upon. But apparently he hasn't been
able to convince all the rest of the chiropractors that the
device is a scientific one. Here and there previous gradu

ates of the Palmer School, as well as chiropractors of other
educational ancestry, have begun to object to its intrusion
into the field. Here are the resolutions adopted by the
Hoosier Chiropractors' Association, printed in its Central
States Bulletin:
Whereas, apparently in order to intimidate chiropractors,
to hold a monopoly upon the chiropractic profession, and to
increase his own personal fortune by perhaps two millions
of dollars, B. J. Palmer has and is attempting to force the
lease of an instrument called the neurocalometer upon chiro
practors who in turn are required to extort from their pa
tients an exorbitant fee for its use;
Whereas, the neurocalometer has been carefully examined
and tested by members of this Association, and found to be
merely an instrument to be used to enable the user to in
crease his charges, which increase in his income has been
boasted about by many of the users;
Whereas, by these tests which were made without preju
dice or favor, it has been found that said instrument can
not in any way be relied upon, neither does it add in the
least in rendering more efficient chiropractic service, nor can
any advantage to the patient be accomplished by its use;
Whereas, the statements of B. J. Palmer since the intro
duction of said instrument have been damaging and appar
ently made with malice aforethought;
Therefore be it resolved, that we, the members of the
H. C. A. do hereby condemn the use of the neurocalometer;
Be it further resolved, that we go on record as warning
all chiropractic patients of the inefficiency of the neurocal
ometer and against the compulsory exploitation of prices by
those chiropractors employing the use of said instrument;
Be it further resolved, that one copy of the resolution be
sent to B. J. Palmer and that we hereby authorize the pub
lication of this resolution when deemed proper by chiro
practors.
And the editor of the publication continues:
The issue is clear cut. Palmer has made the division, it is
Palmer and one thousand chiropractors against the field.
Every chiropractor must take his stand and choose his side.

It might further be added that not all of the thousand will
remain put to the neurocalometer idea. Already reports are
current that suits have been filed for the return of the money
paid on the lease; reports that chiropractors are returning
the machines because they will not do what is claimed. . . .
Had only a few purchased the leases, B. J. xoould have had
little ammunition and chiropractic would have been little
harmed from his ruthless onslaughts. Every time he fails to
sell a lease it means about $2,006 less for him to use in his
national advertising by way of radio, magazines, etc. A day
of adjustment in the future is certain.
CHIROPRACTIC STATISTICS
According to an investigation recently made by Dr. Louis
S. Reed, chiropractic with its 16,000 practitioners is the
largest medical sect now existing in this country. Of course,
no one knows exactly how many chiropractors there are, but
the figure is quite certainly between 15,000 and 17,000. Ac
cording to recent studies, California, stamping ground of
most medical cultism, has some 2,400 chiropractors. New
York 1,475, and Missouri 900. Other states in which the
chiropractors are prominent are Wyoming, Colorado, Kan
sas, Oregon, and Iowa. Wyoming, which has just a few doc
tors, has one chiropractor for every two physicians, and
Oregon one for every three. It has been argued that chiro
practors replace physicians and take care of the shortage that
exists in the small towns. Actually, the chiropractors tend
to concentrate in the cities, 39 per cent of them being in
cities of over 200,000, as contrasted with 26 per cent of
physicians.
As has previously been told, chiropractic grew rapidly
up to 1923. Then it entered a decline which seems to have
persisted since that time. A report of a convention of chiro
practors held in New York in 1930 indicated acceptance by
Mabel Palmer herself, and by many other leaders, of the
idea that chiropractic was on the road to ruin. According to
Dr. Reed, there are today some 2 1 active schools with a prob
able total attendance of 1,400 students. Within the last
three years chiropractors are no longer dominated by the

Palmerites. Moreover, just as the osteopaths have gradually
spread into physical therapy, so also the chiropractors, once
in the field of healing, undertake to advise concerning diet,
massage, physical therapy, colonic irrigations, and similar
procedures. From the main cult have come offshoots which
are concerned more with the ligaments than with the bones;
others which mix hot air treatment with adjustments.
As may well be imagined, most chiropractic colleges are
conducted for profit or as adjuncts to a practice. The great
fountainhead in Davenport is declining. Instead of 2,000 to
3,000 students, as in its heyday, it now boasts only a few
hundred. Much of the success in its early days depended on
the business methods. These included the meal ticket sys
tem of practice, the nonreturnable kimono, and the higher
degree.
By the meal ticket system, the patient is told when he first
enters that he will require twenty adjustments, and he is
sold a ticket, paid for in advance, containing twenty num
bers. Each time he comes a punch is taken in the ticket as
well as in the patient. It is not recorded that any patient
recovers until he has completely exhausted the punches in
his ticket. Though the chiropractor insists that he pushes
back the vertebra he is unable to offer any explanation as to
why it does not stay back.
Most of the patients of chiropractors are women. An old
farmer down in Kansas said that he had noticed that when
ever a man came to a chiropractor, the bone in his spine
that was out of place was usually near the head. The idea
offers intriguing possibilities for continued thought. Women
have, unfortunately, been much more the victims of char
latans than have men. When the lady comes she is told to
bring with her a kimono, which she wears when reclining
on the table. Each time she leaves, the kimono is placed in a
steel locker. Should she decide, between treatments, not to
continue, she must always come back for the kimono. It is
an old rule in charlatanism that the difficult step is to get
the patient into the office. Once inside, he can be sold again.
Although most chiropractors are just ordinary "D. C's.,"

a few of the anointed boast other appendages. Some are
not only Doctors of Chiropractic, but Masters of Chiroprac
tic, Chiropractic Instructors, and Chiropractic Philosophers.
In the catalogues of the college it was the custom to publish
the diplomas granting these degrees. It is significant that the
name sometimes appears twice on the diploma —once where
it is granted, and once where the recipient signs it as grantee.
A visit to the Palmer School made by a representative
of the American Medical Association revealed an extraordi
nary assemblage of buildings typical of quackery. First comes
the home of B. J.; then the famous Garden of St. Peter
resembling, superficially, John Graham's Temple of Health.
St. Peter is the custodian. On payment of ten cents one en
ters the garden and is permitted to see the stuffed snakes
and animals, the fountains and the statues. Then one pro
ceeds to the famous Museum of Spines. Here, it is reported,
there are assembled the spines of every species that boasts a
vertebral column and, most interesting of all, the spine of
the boa constrictor, some 25 feet long and containing 400
vertebrae. Consider what happens to the vertebrae of the
boa constrictor when it is wrapping itself around a tree.
Consider the tremendous number of subluxations in its boa
constrictor spine! What anguish to its serpent heart!
Next to the Spinal Museum is the Library. The investi
gator found, on visiting this Library, that it was locked, and
the key was located by the janitor only with difficulty. When
he finally did get in, he discovered less than a five-foot shelf
of old medical books and three periodicals, the Ladies Home
Journal, True Detective Stories, and some similar publica
tion. What a farce such a collection when contrasted with
the marvelous libraries associated with modern medical
schools! As Dr. Louis Reed emphasizes, without exception,
all chiropractic schools are business institutions run for the
profit of their owners.
Ten per cent of the revenues of the Palmer school was
formerly devoted to a fund for securing chiropractic legisla
tion in various states. Through their national organization,

exhibits of the spines of beautiful girls who enter chiro
practic exhibition, or should it be exhibitionistic, contests.
In state after state chiropractors are practicing without hav
ing fulfilled legal requirements. Time and again they are
arrested, but the lack of funds for prosecution on the part
of State officials has made such arrests well nigh futile. The
chiropractor is not, in any sense of the word, a scientist. He
is a dangerous charlatan opposing scientific medicine and
endeavoring to enter from the basement the practice of
healing. Just what the ultimate outcome of the chiropractic
cult will be no one knows. It is reported that B. J. Palmer
has on several occasions considered a possible fusion of this
cult with some evangelistic doctrine. All of our states exempt
religious healers.
It has been said that osteopathy is essentially a method of
entering the practice of medicine by the back door. Chiro
practic, by contrast, is an attempt to arrive through the cel
lar. The man who applies at the back door at least makes
himself presentable. The one who comes through the cellar
is besmirched with dust and grime; he carries a crowbar
and he may wear a mask!

NATUROPATHY AND ITS PROFESSORS
"After his decease, and a severe casualty deemed fatal by skilful
physicians, we discovered that the Principle of all healing and the law
that governs it is God, a divine Principle, and a spiritual not material
law, and regained health."—Mary Morse Baker Glover Patterson Eddy.
Of
all the nations of the world, the United States is most
afflicted by its healers. Besides those holding the degree
M. D., signifying doctor of medicine and, nowadays, some
seven years of study following high school graduation, a
host of queer practitioners pervade the medical field. They
have conferred on themselves strange combinations of let
ters, indicating the peculiar systems of healing which a
somewhat lax system of legislation and law enforcement per
mits them to practice on an unwary public.
Cult follows cult, and quackery succeeds quackery, fre
quently with amazing rapidity. Moreover, many cults seem
to be definitely confined to small districts and fail to come
to light in the available literature on the subject, or even in
a careful investigation. Then, too, a single temporarily suc
cessful cult like chiropractic —itself the child of osteopathy
and magnetic healing —gives birth to many offshoots which
again propagate more bizarre offspring and unusual hy
brids. A complete picture of the farcical scene would require
endless research. The United States unquestionably bears
the palm in every class so far as healing cults are concerned.
The scientific medicine of today is based on the discov
eries made in the fundamental sciences. It holds to no single
theory as to the causation of disease and it does not insist

correspondingly that the successful treatment of disease de
pends on the use of any single method of manipulation or
administration. The cults may be classified easily into men
tal healing cults, mechanical cults, electric cults, nature
cults and similar divisions, since they adhere definitely to
such single devices. Other cults may be classed merely as
nonmedical, since they deprecate the use of medicaments.
They are founded, moreover, on peculiar fallacies with rela
tion to the anatomy of the body, on misconceptions of cer
tain physiologic functions, or on exaggerations of the rela
tive importance of certain parts of the body in maintaining
it in a constant state of health; these cults avoid the funda
mental sciences as far as possible. Rather than attempt to
correlate the fallacies on which the cults are based with
established knowledge, cultist leaders are inclined to deny
flatly the facts that have been demonstrated. Of germs and
their causation of disease, they take little cognizance, re
ferring constantly to the "germ theory." Many cultist leaders
denounce the eating of meat because of some weird notions
of body chemistry. Others employ apparatus of such intrica
cies as would bring a flush of envy to the cheek of Rube
Goldberg; mechanically such machinery excites the ridi
cule of the humblest tyro in the science of physics. The
complacency with which cultist leaders dispose of the fun
damental facts of science in promoting their views may be
taken as sound evidence of their essential eccentricities.
THE ORGANIZATION OF NATUROPATHY
In one of the suburbs west of Chicago was a sanatorium
conducted by a son of a naturopath, one Dr. Henry Lind-
lahr, who was a graduate of a low-grade medical college in
Illinois called the National Medical University; that also
has passed into the beyond. Chief in this college
(?)
was old
Dr. L. D. Rogers, once secretary of the National Association
of Panpathic Physicians, an attempt to organize all of the
comical cultists into
a
single group.
The evidence available indicates that Henry Lindlahr fell
early in life for the strange notions of health and disease

exploited by Bernarr Macfadden in the moron's bible, Physi
cal Culture, and also for the schemes of Benedict Lust,
founder, as he claims, of the main school of naturopathy in
this country. Of him, more later! As in every other naturo
pathic institution, the methods of diagnosis used in the Lind-
lahr institution were preposterous, the methods of treatment
varied and ridiculous. The slogan of the institution was that
rallying call of all the peculiar cultists—"no surgery, no
drugs, no serums." The methods of treatment used include
strange diets, air baths, water cures, light treatments, chiro
practic, osteopathy, homeopathy, herbals, psychoanalysis, and
any other monkey business that any strange healer might
bring temporarily in the limelight. For instance, schools of
naturopathy teach, among other courses, sysmotherapy, glu-
cokinesis, zone therapy, physicultopathy, astrological diag
nosis, practical sphincterology, phrenological physiology,
spectrochrome therapy, iridiagnosis, tension therapy, and
naprapathy.
THE DEATH OF EUGENE DEBS
When Eugene Debs, eminent leader of the Socialist party,
left Atlanta Prison, he was sent by a woman practitioner of
the Abrams electronic methods in Terre Haute, Indiana, to
the Lindlahr institution. One night I went to see him with
Sinclair Lewis and Paul De Kruif. Lewis was interested in
Debs as material for a novel on labor. The ride was an
event, but the details are of little interest for the present
story. As a physician I was much surprised at that time to
find a patient in a sanatorium coming down to see guests
on his own responsibility just before midnight. We sat on
the porch of the institution talking until the early morning
hours. I explained to Mr. Debs casually the nature of the
institution to which he had committed his health. I remem
ber that Lewis pleaded with him to get some modern medi
cal attention. I did not see Debs again, however, until the
night before his death. The freethinker in politics is likely
to fall for freethinking science just as he falls for political
panaceas.

FADS AND QUACKERY IN HEALING
One evening in 1926 I received a telephone call from the
Lindlahr Sanatorium. The person who called said that Mr.
Debs was dying and that his brother wished to have me
secure for him the advice of some medical specialist. Mr.
Debs, it appears, had told his brother that he wanted me to
be notified in case he was ever in a serious condition. To
the person who called I said that a competent medical man
would ask first to have the patient removed to a reliable hos
pital. The patient was in this instance too far on the last
trail to permit removal. Mr. Debs, it seems, had gone to
visit Carl Sandburg who lives in Elmhurst near the sana
torium. While returning, the great socialist had lapsed into
unconsciousness. For two days he had been treated in the
institution, then his condition being apparently fatal, his
brother had been sent for.
In view of the circumstances I consented to ask two well-
known medical specialists in Chicago to make the trip, and I
went with them to see Mr. Debs. What was the procedure fol
lowed in the naturopathic institution when its chiropractic
director and its medical consultants, such as they were, were
confronted with a serious situation? Mr. Debs, when we saw
him, was clearly the victim of malnutrition. He had been
treated with the strange diets and the starvation treatment
recently so strenuously supported by Bernarr Macfadden in
his periodicals. The noted speaker for socialism lay in bed
barely breathing. His heart was in a state of fibrillation—
a mere twitching of the fibers rather than the sustained
beat characteristic of an active heart. The pupil of one eye
was dilated and the other contracted. The record sheet of
the institution made no note of this observation, which
would have indicated to any competent diagnostician a prob
able disturbance in the condition of the brain. Confronted
with this situation, the healers of the naturopathic sanato
rium had attempted to overcome the congestion in the lung
due to impeded circulation of the blood by applying dia
thermy or electrical heat. Perhaps because of the uncon
sciousness of the patient, he had suffered burns which were
visible on the skin at the points of application of the elec

trodes. Apparently he had not been turned in bed as a com
petent physician would always turn such a patient to prevent
congestion from settling of fluids in the lung. The tissues
were practically dehydrated. Water had not been put into
the body, as it must be put into the tissues of every uncon
scious person if life is to be saved. An unconscious man does
not voluntarily ask for a drink.
Disturbed by the failing heart, the practitioners, whose
slogan was "no surgery, no drugs, no serums," endeavored
first to support the heart by giving a prescription which was
listed on the history chart merely as "eclectic remedies."
An inquiry revealed the fact that cactus, an old eclectic
remedy, had been prescribed—a plant preparation which
was once seriously tested by the American Medical Associa
tion. During the tests it was found that cactus solution put
into the tissues of a dog would not produce a symptom.
Then when the eclectic remedies failed, an attempt was
made to give digitalis. This sovereign drug in diseases of
the heart almost always produces results when properly ad
ministered. The tincture had been given in small doses; a
few drops placed upon the tongue. Finally when this remedy
failed also in stimulating and controlling the heart an at
tempt was made to inject a preparation of digitalis into
the muscles. Obviously, since the practitioners were unaccus
tomed to the use of drugs, they hardly knew how to avail
themselves of potent remedies when they found them neces
sary. The incident is typical of naturopathic treatment.
THE BASES OF NATUROPATHY
A naturopath ought to be, as his name implies, a healer
who depends on natural methods of cure. However, while
walking barefoot in the dew, exposing one's self in the garb
of nature to the rays of sunlight, the eating of hay, grain, and
oats, and similar technics may constitute a part of every
course of naturopathy, the cult has gradually embraced every
strange system of healing that has come across the American
horizon in the past twenty-five years.
The chief exponent of naturopathy is one Benedict Lust

of the American School of Naturopathy in New York City.
Following the name of this philosopher appear usually N.D.,
D.O., D.C., and M.D. The N.D. signifies doctor of naturop
athy; the next two degrees cover osteopathy and chiropractic;
the M.D. claimed is from some homeopathic and eclectic
medical college, although on the witness stand Lust was
apparently unable to prove graduation. Lust claims osteo
pathic licensure in New Jersey, but there is no evidence that
he has ever been licensed for anything in New York. On the
other hand, he has been convicted of practicing without a
license and fined $100 in that state. In his Naturopathy
School and Health Home he offers, as do all other naturo
paths, the whole category of peculiar technics. Benedict
Lust used to be found constantly among the advertisers in
Macfadden publications. There he promoted from time to
time his scheme for blood washing. The technic of blood
washing can be had also by correspondence for $100. It is
taught, furthermore, in several resorts operated by this
minor prophet of healing in Florida and in New Jersey.
From the first, naturopathy has been developed as an
effort to give chiropractic something more to sell than adjust
ments of the spine. Several chiropractic schools teach natur
opathy. Probably 50 per cent of naturopaths have come from
the ranks of chiropractic, and any chiropractor can become
a naturopath by taking a three months' post-graduate course
in a naturopathic school. To dignify these institutions with
the title of schools is exalting them far beyond their merits.
The average course runs through 24 or 36 months with a
short school day. Students come and go as they please. One
school has twenty different names for its courses and offers
a liberal reduction to a student taking four courses at the
same time. One school counts attendance in each class twice
—once for naturopathy and once for chiropractic. Another
school gives each student two diplomas, each diploma bear
ing a different name for the school. These systems are
planned primarily to meet special requirements in various
state laws. Our laws regulating the practice of healing are
the joke of the universe. Of course no school of naturopathy

is associated with a regularly established hospital. The stu
dents learn what they can, when they can, on whom they can.
Recently the Department of Medical Education of the
American Medical Association undertook a special investi
gation of naturopathic schools. The shrine was visited on
November 7, 1927, when it was situated in an old apartment
house on E. 35th Street in New York. There it used two
floors and a portion of a third. The equipment included an
osteopathic table, five chiropractic adjusting tables, a chem
ical laboratory with one table big enough for two students,
two old cupboards, some glassware, and some Bunsen burn
ers. Twenty students were in the college, and fifteen were
graduated in 1926. The school meets only at night and the
students pay two hundred and fifty dollars annually. In
Philadelphia the naturopathic college and hospital is housed
in an old apartment building, the hospital thus far existing
only as a dream. Nevertheless the college issues an eight-
page announcement which not only gives a picture of the
hospital with a complete list of its staff, but also announces
the appointment of six of the graduates as assistant physi
cians to the hospital. Although the school claimed ninety
students, about forty were actually found somewhere around
the institution. Most of the courses are given at night.
In Newark, New Jersey, a two-story dwelling house, the
First National University of Naturopathy, is operated by one
F. W. Collins, N.D., A.M., and his assistant John Parsons
Fields, who it seems is D.C., Ph.C, N.D., D.C., D.Ph., and
M.D. In the same institution are also the Collins and Hill
Realty Co. and the Standard Products Corporation, which
manufactures a water softener and cleanser. This school
gives each graduate two or three diplomas and charges him
six hundred dollars tuition. Actually the school advertises
some twenty bizarre courses, representing twenty different
colleges. The one classroom of which the twenty institutions
can boast, included when seen thirty chairs, a blackboard, a
table, and a piano.

Jersey not for pecuniary profit and registered with the Re
corder of Deeds of the District of Columbia, under Con
gressional Act. An admission fee of $25 charged at first was
raised later to $50. A certificate in the form of a diploma,
granting the degree of a Doctor of Medicine and Master
Diagnostician is given to those who attain a total average of
75 per cent or over in the examination required by the
Academy. This diploma or certificate, be it understood, does
not permit or give anyone the right to practice Medicine and
Surgery. Each member was requested to send in at least once
yearly a report of his investigations, relative to the applica
tion of surgery, drugs, serums, vaccines, electrical and drug-
less treatments, and mental therapeutics.
The Academy, President Collins now announces, which
has been attacked from many sides, and has been inspected
through the Federal Department, Department of Justice,
Attorney General's Office, and Post Office Department, is
still in good standing.
Any graduate physician or surgeon, medical or drugless,
who desires to become a member of the Academy must fur
nish at the time of application a photograph of himself and
photostatic copy of his diploma or diplomas. He must answer
99 questions and, upon receiving a total average of 75 per
cent or over, he is granted the diploma of the American
Academy of Medicine and Surgery, signifying that he passed
a successful examination and conferring upon him the de
gree of Doctor of Medicine and Master Diagnostician. In
case of failure in the examination his admission fee into the
Academy is refunded. So far no list of diplomates or failures
has been reported.
The investigation recently completed revealed ten naturo
pathic schools actively engaged in turning out peculiar
healers for those who like their medicine fantastic. Pennsyl
vania has four of the schools and New York, New Jersey,

of the remainder.

the patient sits facing east or west while his abdomen is
thumped, and colored lights are thrown upon it; iridiag-
nosis, which claims ability to diagnose disease through the
color of the iris of the eye; spectrochrome therapy, in which
the patient is advised to wear clothing and garments accord
ing to the colors of the spectrum; and, in many schools, zono-
therapy. In this technic the body is divided into zones
lengthwise and crosswise, disease in one zone being cured by
the application of little wire springs around the fingers and
toes controlling other zones.
Benedict Lust's own definition of naturopathy includes
the "art of natural healing and of the science of physical
and mental regeneration on the basis of self-reform, nat
ural life, clean and normal diet, hydrotherapy (Priessnitz,
Kneipp, Lehmann, and Just system) , osteopathy, chiroprac
tic, naturopathy, electrotherapy (sunlight and air cult) , diet,
phytotherapy, physical and mental culture to the exclusion
of poisonous drugs and non-adjustable surgery."
Out of the schools of naturopathy and our exceedingly
lackadaisical laws controlling the practice of healing have
come opportunities for other inspired prophets to develop
still more bizarre institutions in medical instruction.
The American College of Sagliftology, located in San
Diego, California, is controlled by one P. Hollow Poole and
his wife. Poole assumed the title of doctor and was promptly
indicted for misuse of that title. His technic is primarily
a part of the uplift movement. Mr. Poole is convinced that
health depends on keeping everything in the interior up
lifted. He therefore sells corsets, belts, rubber stockings, and
other devices planned toward this end. In his college anat
omy, contourology and mensuration constitute courses run
ning from six to twelve months. A graduate is called a
sagliftologist.
In St. Louis Dr. William H. Woodfin, A.M., Ph.D., D.D.,

the master mind system. Dr. Woodfin confers the degrees of
Doctor of Psychology, Doctor of Metaphysics, and Doctor of
Divinity for from $20 to $100. He must be busy, since he has
about twenty stenographers constantly employed. He not
only trains healers but himself treats the sick.
In Seattle, Washington, in 1919 the Universal Sanipractic
College was organized. The word "sanipractic" was defined
as the "practice of health" with the keyword "elimination."
The devotees were concerned with all methods of treatment
except drugs and major surgery, but permitted the adminis
tration of herbs and teas. The Washington state law permits
sanipractors to try everything except the administration of
drugs. The students were therefore primarily chiropractors
who wanted unlimited rights to practice. This institution
represents merely another attempt to find a short route into
the practice of healing for those who want to enter by the
back door.
Naturopathy and the allied cults represent capitalization
for purposes of financial gain of the old advice that outdoor
life, good diet, enough exercise, and rest are conducive to
health and longevity. When these simple principles can be
linked with the printing of worthless pamphlets, intricate
apparatus, or faith cures, the formulas yield gold. By these
systems, misinformation in the field of science is spread
widely among what is probably one of the most ignorant
people in the world relative to the organization of their own
bodies and their care. The slogan, "no bugs, no drugs, no
surgery," is used to catch the unwary. The appeal is one
likely to attract particularly the laborite, the radical, and the
freethinker. The writings of Upton Sinclair on these subjects
mislead thousands. The example of Eugene Debs must
have misled hundreds of others. In time of stress when
pain becomes impossible to bear even by the self-hypnosis of
Christian Science, the nature cure healer himself or the
fanatical exponent of faith healing reaches eagerly for the
hypnotic tablet of a barbituric acid derivative, the soothing
needle of the narcotic, or the blissful unconsciousness of
anesthesia. Then when the heart is no longer able to urge

the tired circulation and begins feebly to discontinue its
automatic functions, the physician is called in; shaking his
head mournfully he provides enough digitalis to slow the
beat and make it more forceful. To this state of affairs one
may apply the reverse of the slogan of a famous rat-paste:
"They don't die in the house." As the spectre of dissolution
peeps over the foot of the bed the naturopathist, chiro
practor, manipulator and faith healer depart. The physician
enters, fountain pen in hand, ready to sign the death cer
tificate.
The practitioners of naturopathy, according to Dr.
Louis S. Reed's late report to the Committee on the Costs
of Medical Care, number some 1,500. Whereas most cults
embrace a single conception as to the cause and healing of
disease, naturopathy embraces everything in nature. Bene
dict Lust, N.D., D.O., D.C., M.D., already mentioned, pre
sents the following definition:
... a distinct school of healing, employing the beneficent
agency of Nature's forces, or water, air, sunlight, earthpower,
electricity, magnetism, exercise, rest, proper diet, various
kinds of mechanical treatment, mental and moral science. As
none of these agents of rejuvenation can cure every disease
(alone) the Naturopath rightly employs the combination
that is best adapted to each individual case. The result of
such ministrations is wholly beneficent. The prophylactic
power of Nature's finer forces, mechanical and occult, re
moves foreign or poisonous matter from the system, restores
nerve and blood vitality, invigorates organs and tissues, and
regenerates the entire organism.
The real naturopaths were, of course, such healers as
Father Kneipp, Priessnitz, and others who advocated natural
living and healed by the use of sunlight, baths, fresh air, and
cold water, but there is little money to be made by these
methods. Hence the modern naturopath embraces every
form of healing that offers opportunity for exploitation.
Thus, there have grown from naturopathy a myriad peculiar
doctrines which run the gamut from aeropathy to zono-
therapy.

The schools of therapy having any status whatever are
three in number, one in Philadelphia, one in New York,
and one in Florida. In these schools the strange notions that
have been mentioned are taught to candidates who may not
be able even to read or write, because preliminary require
ments in such schpols are given little if any consideration.
Although a high-school education may be mentioned as a
necessity, its equivalent may be substituted and the equiva
lent, in the judgment of the admitting officers, would give
pause even to such a mathematical genius as Einstein. The
professors themselves are without baccalaureate degrees or,
in most instances, any other degree of importance; and the
students are not even the equivalent of the professors.
A few of our states provide for licensing naturopaths but
most states include them with the drugless or limited prac
titioners. Once admitted to the practice of healing, these
cultists begin at once to practice unlimited medicine. Since
the weapons of medicine against disease are potent for harm
as well as good, such practitioners are a menace to the public
health and a drain on the public purse. A description of a
few of the extraordinary doctrines follows:
Aerotherapy. Among the hundred or more types of heal
ing offered to the sophisticated is aerotherapy. Obviously,
aerotherapy means treatment by air, but in this instance hot
air is particularly concerned. The patient is baked in a hot
oven. Heat relieves pain and produces an increased flow of
blood to the part heated. The blood aids in removing waste
products and brings to the part the substances that overcome
infection. There is nothing essentially wrong about hot air
therapy.
Since the time of Hippocrates and indeed even in Biblical
legend men have availed themselves of the healing powers
existing in nature. The light and heat of the sun, the burn
ing steam from natural hot springs, the dry air of the desert,
and even the buffeting of the waves of the sea have been used
for physical stimulation in overcoming disease. It has re

mained for the astute commercial minds of our progressive
land to incorporate these qualities for their personal gain.
Aerotherapy as one department of physical therapy be
comes a cult when it is used to the exclusion of all other
forms of healing. In New York a progressive quack estab
lished an institute equipped with special devices for pour
ing hot air over various portions of the body. He issued a
beautiful brochure, illustrated with the likenesses of beauti
ful damsels in various states of negligee, smiling the smile
of the satisfied, under his salubrious ministrations. In this
document appeared incidentally the claim that hot air will
cure anything from ague to zoster. The same claim has been
made by the faith healers and the apostles of manipulation.
But the first call it Christian Science and the second call it
chiropractic.
Alereos System. Here is a system of drugless healing which
"recognized the human body as a wonderful and perfect
machine, which, properly adjusted and taken care of, will
run without friction." It emanates from Brooklyn. "The
Alereos system," says the folder, "in relation to the human
machine, occupies the place of the skilled mechanic to the
disabled engine. It searches for the causes of the trouble and
seeks to remove them by its tools. These are the hands, aided
by several mechanical appliances and vibrations." The home
office supplies heat and mechanical vibration with "several
specially constructed apparati (sic) ." Not content to sell its
simple hot air and vibration treatments on their merits, the
Alereos system plays strongly on the osteopathic and chiro
practic claims of contractions and pinched nerves, and con
demns all drug treatment as poisoning. It is the acme of ex
ploitation of the sweat bath and massage. One takes ten
treatments for twenty-five dollars in advance; obviously, the

stars has always had fascination for the multitude and it
would have been strange, indeed, if some astute healer had
failed to take advantage of this folly in the founding of a
cult. The Astral healers advertise in foreign language news
papers. They read the diagnosis from the horoscope and
then make an additional charge for giving the advice indi
cated by their readings.
Autohemic Therapy. For many years one L. D. Rogers
was the head and chief owner of the National Medical Uni
versity of Chicago. The school was a low-grade institution,
virtually a diploma mill. Rogers is a promoter of medical
schemes and fancies. Like many other cultist leaders he is
constantly founding societies of which he is the chief pan
jandrum. Once he was the permanent secretary of the Na
tional Association of Panpathic Physicians, apparently an
attempt to organize all the comical cultists into a single
group. However, the society had only a brief existence, and
the permanent secretary was quite temporary. Then he
began to exploit a cancer serum and organized the Ameri
can Cancer Research Society, L. D. Rogers, president.
Finally, he got the notion called "autohemic therapy." "It
consists," he says, "in giving the patient a solution made by
attenuating, hemolizing, incubating and potentizing a few
drops of his or her own blood, and administering it accord
ing to a refined technic developed by the author." Playing
the game to the limit, Rogers also advertises a one-hundred-
dollar mail order course for other physicians. He wrote a
book called Autohemic Therapy and organized the Auto
hemic Practitioners. Newspaper publicity in the form of
full-page advertisements and clever press agentry fetch the
come-ons for the course. The appeal is made cleverly to the
anti-medical cultists of all varieties by the slogan "without
use of bugs or drugs." A clever and shrewd old fakir is
L. D. Rogers! There is not an iota of scientific evidence that
his method or his system ever cured anybody of anything.
Autology. E. R. Moras, M.D., founder of autology, finally
arrived in the "booby-hatch." Before that, however, he had
achieved a considerable following through advertising in

the press, and through exploitation along the lines estab
lished by Elbert Hubbard. Indeed, Elbert said of autology:
"Dr. Moras has written a Commonsense Book on Autology,
and by so doing, placed the Standard of the Creed of Health
farther to the front than any man who has lived for a thou
sand years." Ah, well, Elbert was never much given to con
servative statements! As might be expected Moras also had
the support of Physical Culture, Bernarr Macfadden's major
opus; of J. H. Tilden of Denver, who has some fads of his
own, and even of Luther Burbank.
Autology is a system of stereotyped hygienic and dietetic
advice sandwiched in between a lot of pseudoscience and bad
counsel. It is essentially another preachment of Ecclesiastes'
urge for moderation in all things. Unfortunately it was
carried to the point at which Elbert Hubbard said, "Mod
eration, equality, work, and love —you need no other phy
sician." Moras exploited his book at anywhere from $10 to
$2, and on the side sold some patent medicines. Finally, his
eccentricity went beyond the bounds of legal sufferance. He
was arrested for insulting a woman on a train; he attempted
to blackmail Leon Mandel out of a million dollars, and
appealed to the President of the United States to help him
collect $50,000 from Parke-Davis and Company. So his
friends put him in a sanatorium!
Auto-Science. An Auto-Science Institute is conducted in
San Francisco, devoted, it appears, to practical psychology,
scientific serums, and suggestive therapeutics. The watch
word is "Law of Creative Energy." Regular lessons can be
had for four weeks on trial, but the diploma, the degree, and
the "Auto-Science" textbook cost $35, which is a special re
duction from the sum of $50, the regular fee for the course.
The high priest, Dr. E. C. Feyrer, presents testimonials of
grateful imbeciles who have been cured of all sorts of things.
It appears that not only can you heal yourself, but you can
help others by mental broadcasting. Is there no protection
against this sort of thing? Must one be healed even when he
enjoys ill health?

a homeopath, presumably obsessed with the homeopathic
slogan "similia similibus curantus," or "like cures like."
Dr. Charles H. Duncan of New York was able to have his
views promulgated through some of the good medical jour
nals and their strangeness secured him unusually great news
paper recognition. "Autotherapy," as the name implies, is
"self-therapy" or "natural therapy." The word "nature" is a
term to conjure with in cultism. Carrying the idea of the
"hair of the dog that bit you" to its ultimate interpretation,
Duncan recommends the healing of boils by cooking up and
swallowing the matter from the boil; for dysentery he filters
the excretions and injects the fluid that filters through; for
tuberculosis he filters the sputum and injects the filtrate. He
claims all sorts of cures. It is the belief of competent authori
ties that the system has no basis in scientific knowledge and
that the results secured, if any, are merely such as follow
injections of foreign substances of any kind into the body.
B
Biodynamochromatic Diagnosis and Therapy. Whenever
the irregulars in the healing art assemble for the purpose of
exchanging trade secrets and telling each other how good
they are, George Starr White, M.D., F.S.Sc. (Lond.) , D.C.,
Ph.D., LL.D., Los Angeles, is among those present. He was
"second vice president" of the Allied Medical Associations
in 1918. He is also opposed to vaccination and helps out
the American Medical Liberty League. White was gradu
ated from the New York Homeopathic Medical College
when he was forty-two years old. He played with Abrams'
spondylotherapy (see later) and also pushed Fitzgerald's
"zone therapy" (see later) . Then he developed the fancy-
name system that combines a lot of hocus-pocus —it seems
one diagnoses disease by a "Sympathetic Vagal Reflex." To
elicit the said phenomenon, the patient faces east or west
and his abdomen is thumped until a dull area is found.
Then colored lights are thrown on the abdomen and the
thumping is continued. A ruby and blue light with asso
ciated dullness means one thing and a green light combina

tion another. That is to say, Dr. White says so; really, it
doesn't mean anything. Once Dr. White took a flier in the
patent medicine business. The F.S.Sc. (Lond.) , with which
he is endowed, means "Fellow of the Incorporated Society
of Science, Letters, and Arts of London, Ltd." Lots of people
who play the same game as White have the same letters. The
cost of the elegant diploma is about $5. Sometimes White
also puts after his name D.C., Ph.D., LL.D. No one knows
where he got those. The method was given a beautiful send-
off in Mr. Macfadden's Physical Culture magazine by Dr.
Edwin F. Bowers in February, 1918. Dr. Bowers is not a
doctor of medicine, and the only M.D. he has is the one
Macfadden gives him. Strange how the same names recur
again and again in these stories of the ghoullike activities
of the harpies who live by exploiting the sick!
In 1925, White produced the last word in this fancy busi
ness, the Rithmo-Chrome and Duo-Colors. He has a lot of
books to sell and a lot of apparatus. For instance, in his
latest announcement, Figure 10 shows a "person sitting
on a Filteray Cushion and receiving Filtered Ultrared
Rays while doing Rithmo-Chrome breathing and inhaling
Oxygen-Vapor or Medicated Vapor and at the time getting
therapeutic effect of the magnetic forces of the earth, as he
is grounded and facing exactly north and south." If the
Duo-Colors are added to this, Dr. White affirms, the patient
is certainly getting "Natural Methods Condenst." And if
he isn't getting that, what is he getting?
Biological Blood-Washing. This utter humbug is accred
ited to Benedict Lust, of whom more later. He is one of
the king pins of the naturopathy cult. Under "naturopathy"
his record will be made apparent.
Chirothesians. This peculiar group emanates from Cali
fornia, and its fountainhead is the Western College of Drug-
less Therapeutics. It combines a new religious cult with
medical hocus. Many State laws give amnesty to religious
healers. The catalogue of the college says: "While working

under this title, healers ordained to work are protected
from annoyance by the state medical board." Evidently a
chirothesian is not limited to any system. One had his office
full of bottles labeled cancer, paralysis, rheumatism, and
tumors; another said that he made his diagnoses by exami
nation of the pulse and "irido-diagnosis." (For the latter
system, see Under "I.") Chirothesianism is apparently a
method of mixing religion and fake healing to get around
the medical practice laws.
Christos (blood washers) . A half-dozen cults use the term,
"blood washing" as a come-on. It usually refers to some
method of purging the intestinal tract. The Christos cult
consists mostly of Negroes. Herb tonics are dispensed with
the claim that they are especially blessed by Christ, the
Savior. Taken in the form of tea, these herbs wash the blood
of sin and impurities. New York authorities arrested and
prosecuted the Negro leaders.
Chromopathy. Naturopathic physicians who practiced
White's colored light system on the side used this term to
indicate the healing of disease by colored lights.
Chromatherapy. Another modification of White's colored
light scheme.
Electric Light Diagnosis and Therapy. See Electrotherapy.
Electro-Homeopathy. A combination of electrotherapy and
homeopathy. (See under each.)
Electro-Naprapathy. A combination of two cults. (See
under each.)
Electrotherapy. The use of electric devices has a definite
place in the treatment of disease. It should not be thought,
however, that any electrician or machinist is competent to
use such methods. Electricity is a two-edged sword; in the
hands of the ignorant, it may wreak disaster. Actually its use
should be limited to those who have had the training of a
physician and then given special study to the use of electric
devices or to competent technicians working under the direc
tion of a physician.

Geotherapy. New York investigators found a concern
treating disease by the application of little pads of earth —
hence the grandiloquent title. A warning resulted in the
abandonment of the enterprise.
Irido-Diagnosis. The poetical notion that the eye is the
mirror of the soul evidently convinced a minor medical
prophet in Chicago that money might be made by founding
a school of medicine in which the diagnosis of all diseases
would depend on the ability to notice the changing colors
of the iris or colored material of the eye. With a remarkable
genius for publicity, he succeeded in attracting much free
newspaper mention and in leading to his school numerous
ignorant satellites who desired to enter on the practice of
healing by some easy route. Among those attracted have been
a few regularly licensed physicians who sought to exploit
themselves and enhance their incomes by adding the claim
of this superior power to such as might already have been
conferred upon them by the state. Even today the practi
tioners of this vagary burst into temporary luminescence in
the sensation-seeking press. Fortunately the prophet himself
was accused by his wife of mental vagaries. He gradually
subsided!

fornia, claiming in his advertisement the special powers of
reducing and building obesity, and reducing various dis

Naturology. This is merely another name for naturopathy.
This school was founded by a naturopath of the Benedict
Lust school who adopted this fanciful name to show that he

Pathiatry. This particular cult is trademarked. "It com

So simple and delightful as to become a part of the daily

Poropathy. Arthur de Collard turned up in Richmond,
Va., and persuaded the legislature in that State, in 1918, to
license him to practice poropathy. Arthur claimed to be a
cousin of Napoleon and a graduate of several European uni
versities. His diplomas, he said, had all been burned, and
he would not answer the simplest question on the elements
of medicine and surgery. The bill defined poropathy and
manipulative surgery as a new branch of therapeutics. It
employs no medicine taken through the stomach, and does
not employ the knife. Healing and curative agencies and
lotions, however, applied directly to the diseased organs and

bill, would adjust, heal and cure broken bones, sprains, and
dislocations. After a committee substitute for the bill and
various amendments to the substitute had been rejected, the

the right to practice poropathy in Virginia. There are now
several poropathists in the state who have taken a course
under De Collard.
Practo-therapy. This was a group of men and women,
mostly nurses, who treated human ills through intestinal
irrigation. "Practo-therapy" was evidently a fanciful title in

Quartz-therapists. A term used by "Naturopath" irregulars

Sanatology. Sanatology is a delightful title conferred on his
particular science of healing by Dr. P. L. Clark, Chicago,
who insists that he is the first man in the world to make
the pronouncement and prove that acidosis and toxicosis
are the two basic causes of all disease. In his school on Prairie

move the causes and restore the body to normal. He issues
little cards for free consultation and blood-pressure test,
which are the "come-ons" by which he secures permanent

THE QUACKERY OF ALBERT ABRAMS
"A false tendency," replied Goethe, "is not productive; or if it is,
what it produces is of no worth. It is not so difficult to perceive this
in others; but with respect to oneself the case is different, and great
freedom of mind is required. And even knowledge of the truth is not
always of use; we delay, doubt, cannot resolve,—just as one finds it
difficult to leave a beloved girl of whose infidelity one has long had
repeated proofs."—Conversations of Goethe with Eckermann.
a lready well sunk in the oblivion that is the terminus of
A most forms of medical quackery, nevertheless the
A.brams box, E.R.A., the electronic reactions of Abrams, or
some more recent modification of this bizarre notion are still
promoted by a few charlatans. Albert Abrams attracted
world-wide notoriety by the unusually picturesque character
of his methods. He was born in San Francisco in 1864.
According to available records, he attended the University
of Heidelberg, Germany, and was graduated in 1882. The
story of his career in brief as told by himself in Who's Who
(for he was early included in that assemblage of the noted
and notorious) , indicates an average medical existence until
1910. Some ten years after his graduation, he became pro
fessor of pathology in the Cooper Medical College in San
Francisco, holding the position from 1893 to 1898. His ear
nestness and intelligence had apparently been recognized by
the California State Medical Society, of which he became
vice president in 1889; he had been made president of the
San Francisco Medico-Chirurgical Society in 1893. Coinci
dent with his recognition as a pathologist, he began to write

profusely not only on scientific topics, but also a sort of
medical belles-lettres which were considered clever for their
day. They were somewhat satirical in tone and attracted
wide attention.
SPONDYLOTHERAPY
In 1909 Abrams published a work called Spinal Thera
peutics, and in 1910 a volume on Spondylotherapy, which
two books constituted his first definite departure from med
ical orthodoxy. The term came from spondylo, a Greek word
referring to the spine, not the American "spondulix." In
creating spondylotherapy, Albert Abrams emphasized the
peculiar hypothesis that the reflex centers in the spine could
be stimulated by constant, rapid percussion or hammering,
and that this could be used for diagnosis and treatment. In
reviewing his book, The Journal of the American Medical
Association called attention casually to the fact that this
might be considered an attempt to give the general medical
men something akin to osteopathy and chiropractic. At any
event, Dr. Abrams soon began to exploit his idea, giving
courses on spondylotherapy in various parts of the country
at $50 per course and calling the attention of physicians to
his methods by various types of advertising, just within the
fold of ethical procedure. In 1922, after Abrams had con
ceived his remarkable scheme of electronic medicine, spon
dylotherapy courses of one month each advanced to a fee
of $200 per course. At the time when he first began to pro
mote his conception of spinal percussion, he founded the
American Association for the Study of Spondylotherapy, of
which he naturally became president and later honorary
president.
It is not at all unusual for medical cults to organize them
selves promptly for efficient salesmanship and exploitation of
their wares. It must be pointed out, however, that this is
not the same thing as the organizing of scientists into bodies
that meet once each year for the interchange of advance in
scientific knowledge.

FADS AND QUACKERY IN HEALING
THE BIRTH OF E.R.A.
Twelve years after he had apparently percussed the back
to the fullest extent of what it would yield monetarily, Dr.
Albert Abrams turned the patient over and began to thump
the abdomen.
For many years the art of percussion has constituted a sig
nificant part of the practice of physical diagnosis. Indeed,
Auenbrugger, who evolved the science of percussion more
than a century ago, had shown physicians that various parts
of the body when struck give off a resounding tone or a dull
tone, according to the type of tissue that lay underneath.
The method had been used to great advantage since that
time for the diagnosis of such diseases as pneumonia, tuber
culosis, enlargement of the heart, collections of fluid in the
lungs or abdomen, and similar conditions. However, Dr.
Abrams did not confine himself simply to percussion of the
abdomen. That indeed was simply incidental. It added to
the psychic suggestion of his machinery a vicarious laying
on of hands. He utilized all of the mystery and profound
awe that are inherent in electric apparatus, particularly the
radio. Instruments were developed beside which a Goldberg
cartoon is simple indeed. In the Goldberg cartoon a brick
falls on a springboard causing a rock to hit a cat which
springs at a canary causing it to flutter its wings. This puts
out a candle which has been heating some water in a spoon.
The steam condensing drops on the bald head of a sleeping
man in a rocking chair. Awakening with a start he begins to
rock, thus activating a fan which chases away a fly that has
been crawling on the fat man's bald head.
In brief, Abrams secured from a prospective patient a
drop of blood upon a piece of filter paper and placed this in
an apparatus called a "dynamizer." This dynamizer was in
turn connected with a rheostatic dynamizer from which
wires passed to a vibratory rheostat, which finally was con

passed from the measuring rheostat to the forehead of some
healthy individual. The individual stripped himself to the
waist and then faced west in a dim light. Notice this added
hokum that goes back to the symbolism of Biblical legend!
The operator, or Abrams' disciple, as he may better be
termed, then percussed or tapped upon the abdomen of this
healthy subject. Various areas of dullness naturally were
found, and it was the peculiar delusion of Albert Abrams
that he could tell whether the person whose blood was being
tested was suffering from syphilis, sarcoma, carcinoma or
cancer, typhoid fever, malaria, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, or
various forms of sepsis by such dull areas. Note that he
selected the diseases most feared by mankind. Not only that!
He claimed he could determine the very spot within the
body of the individual who had supplied the blood at which
the disease had its focus. Furthermore, the severity of the
condition was measured in ohms of resistance. Still more
wonderful, but unfortunately not true, Dr. Abrams claimed
that one could substitute the autograph of some dead indi
vidual instead of his blood and find out what diseases that
individual suffered from. Finally, he asserted that he could
determine, according to the amount of dullness and its
position, the religion of the person tested. In his periodical,
founded especially for disseminating these extraordinary
ideas, he classified six types of religion, including Catholic,
Methodist, Seventh-Day Adventists, Theosophist, Protestant,
and Jews, with the area of dullness for the Methodist in the
left lower quarter of the abdomen and that for a Protestant
in the right lower quarter, never explaining what peculiar
conditions of the appendix in the right lower corner, or the
lower large bowel in the lower left quarter might be re
sponsible for the varying dullness in the subject tested. The
explanation was never forthcoming as to why the blood of
persons of the Jewish faith should produce so much more
abdominal dullness in the subject than that of Christians.
Had the percussion been made directly on the persons con
cerned, the frequency of constipation in persons of Jewish
origin, who are naturally heavy eaters, might have explained

the matter satisfactorily, but it must be borne in mind that
the percussion was invariably made on a healthy subject and
that the person concerned supplied only a drop of blood
which was placed in the Abrams dynamizer. Once these
strange devices were developed, Dr. Abrams made them
available to physicians and osteopaths who cared to have
them.
A periodical known as Physical Clinical Medicine was
founded and "devoted to the study of the electronic re
actions of Abrams in the diagnosis, treatment, and pathology
of disease." It was sold at $1 per copy or $2 per year. Here
Abrams advertised his courses in spondylotherapy and elec
tronic diagnosis and treatment at $200 per course in ad
vance, and here also he offered to furnish the four pieces
of intricate machinery for a total of $198 with the significant
legend "no apparatus sold on credit—terms cash."
It will be seen that thus far Albert Abrams was concerned
only with the diagnosis of disease and that the electronic
method had nothing to say about treatment. It is a well-
known fact, however, that much more money is to be made
from persistent courses of treatment which involve numer
ous visits to the office of the cultist than from the single
visit that produces a diagnosis. It might have been expected,
therefore, that the astute Abrams would develop a method
of treatment on the basis of his system of diagnosis. The
device which he finally issued was known as the oscilloclast.
This device was to be had only on lease, however. The lessee
had to sign a contract that he would not open the device
after it was received. The oscilloclast was sold for a first pay
ment of either $200 or $250, according to whether it was
wired for alternating or direct current, and the lessee was
responsible for monthly payments of $5 each, covering its
term of use. According to the theory of the exploiter of this
device, each disease has a vibration rate. When the patient
is subjected to treatment with the device the vibration rate
is made the same as that of the condition from which he
presumably may suffer.

THE QUACKERY OF ALBERT ABRAMS
EXPLOSION OF THE ABRAMS NOTION
In October, 1923, an opportunity occurred in Los Angeles
to examine the actual value of the Abrams apparatus
through the medium of a justice court case. In connection
with this matter, Professor R. A. Millikan, head of the Cali
fornia Institute of Technology, winner of the Nobel Prize
in physics and an authority in the realm of physics, exam
ined the Abrams apparatus and its method of use. He stated
that he did not consider that this apparatus rested upon any
sort of scientific foundation whatever, and, indeed, that the
claims set up by Abrams and his followers from the stand
point of physics are the height of absurdity. In a more tech
nical explanation, Professor Millikan pointed out that when
making a diagnosis, the Abrams followers insert electric
resistance into a circuit which cannot oscillate at all, and
therefore has no vibration frequency and that the claim that
a diagnosis can be made by turning a dial to different
buttons indicates complete ignorance of the fundamental
laws of physics. He further pointed out that Abrams' fol
lowers claim that they impose on the microorganism of dis
ease its own vibration frequency; yet what they actually do
is to impose one and the same vibration frequency for all
diseases. "If a microorganism has any natural frequency at
all," said Professor Millikan, "it would have to be millions
of times higher than any audible frequency of the kind they
use in the treatment, so that the claim that they are finding
and then imposing upon the disease its own natural fre
quency is simply the height of ignorance in view of the kind
of physical mechanism with which they are dealing." Pro
fessor Millikan characterized the device perfectly when he
said it was the kind of machine a ten-year-old boy would
build to fool an eight-year-old.
At the same time other investigations were made by phy
sicians who did not hesitate to open and analyze the Abrams
apparatus. It was found that it constituted a veritable jungle
of electric wires—an apparatus violating all the sound rules
of electric construction. Indeed, cases are reported of deaths

that occurred to persons subjected to treatment, because the
construction of the apparatus was such that the ignorant
electronic practitioner so connected the machinery that the
full city current passed through the body of the patient.
THE ABRAMS PRACTITIONER
We come then particularly to the type of physician who
employs the Abrams apparatus, and who is pleased to call
himself an "electronic practitioner." The records of many
were in the files of the American Medical Association that
are devoted to quacks and quackery. As was pointed out,
Abrams organized early the American Association for the
Study of Spondylotherapy. Promptly on the launching of so-
called electronic medicine he developed the American Elec
tronic Research Association with various state branches.
Albert Abrams was first president and then honorary presi
dent. Early in the development of his campaign, Abrams
determined to admit osteopaths to the exclusive circle of
electronic practitioners and to his courses in San Francisco.
He knew the value that attaches itself to exclusiveness, and
the humble chiropractor was not admitted into the sacred
fold. However, certain chiropractors are apparently not
averse to employing the Abrams machinery for extracting
shekels from the deluded and unwary. Indeed, the report of
the annual convention of the American Electronic Research
Association brought prominently to the attention of those
present the fact that manufacturers of Abrams apparatus
were regularly selling such a device to chiropractors. One
Dr. Cowan, who it appears represented the American Insti
tute of Rational Therapeutics in Chicago, spoke as follows:
Question: What is the name of the machine?
Mr. Cowan: We have two types of treating machines. One
is a unit that treats one person at a time. That is called the
electronoclast. We have also a master machine that treats six
patients at a time. That is known as the isoclast.
Question: The diagnostic machine?

Mr. Cowan: That is known as the hemopathometer. Hemo

Question: Do you sell to chiropractors?
Mr. Cowan: Do we sell to chiropractors? I answered that
by saying that we do just exactly like everyone else on the
floor. If a chiropractor is licensed by the State of Illinois
Question: Yes or no.
Mr. Cowan: All right, I do exactly like my competitors,
yes, I do like they do. Does that answer it?
As I said, we have over 300 graduates who have taken our
work. The vast majority of them are osteopaths, next are the
medical men. We have a smattering of other practitioners.
In the state of Illinois we have no chiropractic license. These
men are on a plane with the medical men, almost. They can
sign death certificates. They are permitted to practice. If
they come to us we teach them the work. If it is wrong, if you
people think so, we are willing to change it, if they do.
Dr. Replogle: I would like to know what is the use of so
many funny names? Why not call it the oscilloclast? That
was the original name.
Mr. Cowan: That is a very good question. Why not call
it the oscilloclast? Unfortunately, we are living in an age
where it is not heaven yet, and if a name is perfected by any
one individual and copyrighted, no one has a right, even if
they so desired, to name their apparatus after that. Iso means
the same, clast means to break down. That is the principle
of our treating machine. We break down by similar vibra
tions. That is why we call it isoclast. The word oscillo is
different.
Dr. Replogle: Oscilloclast, clast means to break, does your
machine mean any more than that?
Mr. Cowan: If I would use the word oscilloclast, I could
not use it if I wanted to.
Dr. Cowan was no modest violet in discussing his appa
ratus: "In the diagnostic machine," he said, "we check up
Dr. Abrams. We don't maintain that Dr. Abrams was wrong,
but he knew nothing of what he was talking about." It is the

Abrams' device, that Abrams knew little or nothing at all
about the fundamental facts of electricity.
Were the cult still active, it might be worth while to
recapitulate some of the many data accumulated by the
American Medical Association of attempts to study scien
tifically the Abrams apparatus and to submit Abrams and
his followers to tests under scientifically controlled methods.
The blood of a guinea pig, and a lady guinea pig at that, was
sent to an Abrams practitioner in Oklahoma City, purport
ing to be from Mr. P., whose history was sent with it. The
Abrams practitioner submitted one of those remarkable
diagnoses of all sorts of diseases with various ohms of re
sistance. Yet a postmortem of this virtuous, unsuspecting
lady guinea pig showed her to be suffering from none of the
highly unvirtuous complaints which were accredited to the
blood that she yielded. Then the blood of a most gentle
manly guinea pig was sent to an Abrams practitioner in
Albuquerque, and the astounding report was returned that
this remarkable animal suffered from a streptococcic in
fection of his left fallopian tube. He had shown no female
characteristics up to that time, and a postmortem examina
tion yielded no evidence of ladylike attributes. Similar ex
periments were made with all sorts of Abrams practitioners
in all parts of the country and with equally preposterous
results. When I asked Mr. Upton Sinclair what he thought
of these experiments, he said: "I think that was a dirty
trick to play on a man like Albert Abrams."
The apotheosis of Abrams' career came with the intro
duction of the sphygmo-biometer, to be used in diagnosing
the presence of oil beneath the surface of the earth. One
thing about oil, however, it is either there or it is not. Some
body digs down to prove its presence or absence. But a lady
may be told that she has a cancer, which is promptly re
lieved by the Abrams machine, and since she never had a
cancer in the first place she is found in many summer resorts
bragging about her cure. It takes an X-ray and most times an
operation to determine the certain presence of this internal
cancer.

THE QUACKERY OF ALBERT ABRAMS
This remarkable cult naturally attracted wide attention in
the daily press. It became a common subject of newspaper
consideration, and astute editors of magazines saw opportu
nity for exploitation. Early in the history of the cult, Pear
son's Magazine succumbed to the Abrams publicity. On the
other hand, the Dearborn Independent, perhaps stimulated
somewhat by Mr. Ford's anti-Semitic leanings, revealed the
fallacies and interests underlying the Abrams exploitation.
Again the Scientific American published a series of articles
constituting a complete investigation of the Abrams matter
which showed it to be quite without reason.
ABRAMSISM IN ENGLAND
In January, 1925, the British Medical Journal published
the full report of a British committee on a device developed
by one Dr. E. W. Boyd, apparently a disciple of Abrams,
who had developed what he called an "emanometer." One
of the members of this committee, an engineer named
W. Whatley Smith, soon came to light as the author of
articles in several periodicals addressed to the public, in
which he featured the findings of the committee, emphasiz
ing his belief that the results had to some extent established
the principles underlying the observations of Dr. Abrams.
One of his articles was headed with the direct question:
"Did Dr. Abrams Make A Real Discovery?" To that the
answer is obvious. Since time immemorial it has been known
that a certain number of credulous persons will always be
found who will believe anything that they cannot under
stand; this, after all, was the great discovery of Dr. Abrams.
The complicated machinery that he devised for extracting
the shekels of the unwary was the modus operandi /or put
ting his discovery to practical effect.
In Mr. Smith's statement as to the work of the British
committee he omitted many facts which can be gleaned by
careful reading from the original report. In the first place,
Dr. W. E. Boyd derived his knowledge of the Abrams device
from X-ray pictures of the apparatus, since he had contracted
not to open it. He concluded that the Abrams resistance box

was not a resistance device, but a coil wound for inductance.
Sir Thomas Horder, the head of the committee, emphasized
that the Boyd apparatus is not the Abrams apparatus. "It is
commonly but erroneously supposed," he said, "that the
instrument of Boyd is no more than a minor variation on
that of Abrams, whereas it appears actually to be a design
de novo based on a different conception of the phenomena
involved." Sir Thomas Horder also pointed out that none
of the members of the committee mastered the technic for
themselves and that they depended on the work of the ex
ponents of the method; he thanked Dr. Boyd particularly
for lending himself to the work.
In analyzing the results it may be important first to point
out that attempts were made to measure electrically the
changes alleged to occur, thus avoiding the percussing tests
on the abdomen of a human, but that this was found im
possible. The results were indeterminate and the committee
does not even report them. Let us consider then the report
on the tests of the sputum, to which Mr. Whatley Smith
refers. A first series of tests was carried out in London. Here
Dr. Boyd endeavored to separate correctly twenty pairs of
specimens of sputum taken from two patients chosen and
approved by one Dr. McCrae. "The outcome of the test was
unfavorable to the technic," says the report, "for of the
results returned by the exponents only eleven were correct,
while nine were wrong; which is just the kind of result
which would be expected if chance alone were operative."
Mr. Smith says nothing in his paper of this test.
The report points out that Dr. Boyd sent a memorandum
to the committee ascribing his failure to the fact that the
arrangements were not satisfactory and that the time re
quired for checking the specimens caused them to become
stale. He then arranged for another test in his own labora
tory, in which he supplied the specimens and in which the
only ones present were Mr. Whatley Smith, Dr. Boyd, Dr.
Boyd's secretary, and two Glasgow boys who were the sub
jects. It was this test which Mr. Whatley Smith glorifies as
one hundred per cent perfect. No real scientist who reads

the details of the tests conducted for Mr. Whatley Smith will
feel anything but a sort of pity for Mr. Smith's credulity.
One can remember in this connection only similar groups of
investigators who have been the willing scapegoats for think
ing horses, spiritualistic mediums, and hysterical malin
gerers. Indeed, it occurred to the representatives of the com
mittee that Mr. Smith might have been overenthusiastic, so
the full committee, including Sir Thomas Horder, Mr.
E. J. Dingwall, and Dr. Heald proceeded to Glasgow for a
repetition of the tests exhibited for Mr. Smith. The whole
committee was satisfied. That is the sum and substance of
the tests made in England to determine whether or not the
Abrams ideas were sound and the Abrams devices trust
worthy.
A real scientist would have drawn the conclusion from
these tests that Dr. Boyd, in his own laboratory, using cer
tain electric apparatus, had apparently been able to dis
tinguish between two specimens of sputum through a change
in the percussion notes of the abdomens of two boys with
whom the sputums were connected electrically. Instead, the
committee drew the conclusion that these experiments estab
lish to a high degree of probability the fundamental propo
sition underlying the apparatus designed for eliciting the
electronic reactions of Abrams. They have the saving grace
to say that the whole thing is extremely elusive and highly
susceptible to interference and that it would be premature
even to hazard a hypothesis as to the physical basis of the
phenomena described. As is obvious to anyone who can read,
the experiments have nothing whatever to do with the
diagnosis of disease. Realizing perhaps the dangerous use
that might be made of their conclusions by the followers of
Abrams, the committee stated their view on this point in
no uncertain terms:
"To sum up," they said, "the conclusions arrived at in
this communication leave the position of the practicing elec-
tronist as scientifically unsound and as ethically unjustified
as it was before. They give no sanction for the use of E.R.A.
in the diagnosis or in the treatment of disease. Nor does

there appear to be any other sanction for this kind of prac
tice at the present time."
THE DEATH OF ABRAMS
On January 13, 1924, Dr. Abrams departed this life, suc
cumbing to an attack of pneumonia. He left behind him
considerable property and several relatives, together with a
will indicating his desire that a school be established for
perpetuating his electronic methods and his discoveries.
Promptly suits were instituted involving the property thus
concerned. Electronic practice had paid well, as is apparent
from the fact that the available assets amounted to at least
a million dollars, not including the value of the patents for
the Abrams devices. These patents are obviously worthless
without the promotion of an Abrams behind them and if
one is to judge by the available evidence, the future will
show only diminishing returns. Indeed, in filing her suit,
the sister of Albert Abrams pointed out that the organization
of the college, the charitable institution which he had in his
lifetime established, was merely a profit-making concern of
Dr. Abrams and was his individual property. But now the
Abrams College no longer functions except as the address
of an alleged Abrams research organization.
It is common in the history of cults in medicine that they
live as long as there are two reasons for their existence: (1)
The survival of and promotion by the major prophet who
inspires his followers by his personality, his enthusiasm, and
his methods; (2) the existence of funds to a considerable
amount, administered by trustees who cannot reach the prin
cipal, and capable of earning additional funds which are
devoted to the perpetuation of the cult. So far as electronic
medicine is concerned, the major prophet has passed and
there seems to have appeared on the horizon thus far no
chief disciple of his unusual personality. On the other hand,
the funds left by Abrams constituted a juicy bone for which
the attorneys for his relatives and representatives of the elec
tronic organizations contested mightily. Apparently an agree
ment was reached whereby the institution elaborated by

Albert Abrams for the promotion of his methods and his de
vices is perpetuated. So long, therefore, as these funds are
not detoured from that purpose there will be a few elec
tronic practitioners to ply the public with their method of
diagnosing and treating disease. It has been customary to
characterize such methods as pseudoscientific. To use such
a term in connection with the Abrams technic and devices
is to dignify them far beyond their merit. They are, in fact,
only the continuous proof that a considerable number of
people are willing to believe anything that they do not
understand. The possibilities of financial gain invariably
attract many who are willing to believe so long as belief
constitutes a source of income.
EVOLUTION OF THE ABRAMS NOTION
It has been said that whenever a new idea develops in any
field it becomes the source of innumerable similar extraor
dinary conceptions. Attention has already been called to the
neuro-calometer developed by B. J. Palmer to get aboard the
Abrams band wagon, exactly as Abrams developed that to
take advantage of the public interest in osteopathy and
chiropractic. Shortly after the appearance of Albert Abrams
upon the medical scene, Gaylord Wilshire of Los Angeles
brought to public attention, through extensive announce
ments in the press, a device which he called the "Ionaco,"
and which Arthur J. Cramp, Director of the Bureau of In
vestigation of the American Medical Association, rechris-
tened the "magic horse collar."
The Ionaco, briefly, consisted merely of a coil of wire
inside a second coil. The second coil was connected with the
house current. Sometimes there was placed at the end of the
second coil a little light. Exactly as the moving point on the
dial of a gas meter, or the deflecting needle of a galvanometer
will fix the patient's attention and thereby enhance the
power of suggestion, so also will a little light serve this
purpose. The patient was told that he might be rid of any
chronic disorder merely by placing this device around the
neck and turning on the current. It was said that by this

means a magnetic field was created and that this magnetic
field controlled all disease by magnetizing the iron in the
blood. If the reader has ever attempted to pick up a piece
of spinach with a magnet, he will ascertain how utterly pre
posterous is this notion. The iron in the blood is organic
combined iron exactly as is the iron in spinach, and there is
no evidence that the creation of a magnetic field in any way
influences such combined iron. However, even if the hypoth
esis were true, there would still be no reason for magnetizing
the iron in the blood to overcome tuberculosis, heart disease,
disease of the kidneys, or similar disturbances.
Gaylord Wilshire sold these devices for $55 cash or $65
on time payments, and thousands of them were sold by his
methods of promotion. Shortly after the development of the
device Wilshire himself died of a disease of the kidney in a
New York hospital, no doubt without the benefit of his own
invention. He was a remarkable charlatan. Twenty-five years
previously he had first attracted public attention by selling
gold mines to socialists on time payments, one dollar down
and one dollar a week. Then he came to public notice
through speculation in subdivisions outside Los Angeles—
somewhat the same type of financial promotion. However,
the City of Los Angeles still perpetuates his name in the
Wilshire Boulevard and the Wilshire Building.
Following the death of Gaylord Wilshire, hundreds of imi
tators brought similar devices to public notice. They were
christened variously, as the "Ionizer," the "Theronoid," the
"Restoro," and many other appellations. All were promoted
with the same type of publicity that sold the Ionaco. No
doubt the greatest sales were secured by the use of the radio.
Of the use of the radio in the promotion of quackery, more
will be said in a later chapter. The modern charlatan avails
himself of this, as of every other method, of publicity.
One of the most remarkable examples of the power of sug
gestion was demonstrated in an exhibit of the Restoro in a
Chicago salesroom. Following a morning of fatiguing work
in nearby department stores, employees would stop briefly for
luncheon in a restaurant in which all of the seats had, as

Irvin Cobb put it, elephantiasis of one arm. They then pro
ceeded to the exhibit of Restoros and sat fifteen or twenty
minutes quietly in a chair with the Restoro device about
their necks. At the end of the treatment they readily signed
testimonials stating that they felt much better on leaving
than when they came in. The observation was entirely true.
What they failed to take into account was the fact that their
ordinary routine did not include luncheon followed by
twenty-five minutes of enforced rest. The Restoro device was
simply the intermediary that made the rest compulsory. This
is what scientific medicine calls an uncontrolled experiment.
It has been difficult to separate from the scientific field of
physical therapy the remarkably important powers inherent
from the point of view of suggestion in shooting sparks, bril
liant lights, and similar electrical manifestations. It is pro
posed later, in a discussion of the rise of physical therapy, to
analyze some of these methods.

"Exaggeration is in the course of things. Nature sends no creature, no
man into the world without adding a small excess of his proper qual
ity." —Ralph Waldo Emerson on "Nature."
Three
types of persons are interested in health: those who
are well; those who are sick; and those who are well but
who think they are sick. In these times, the interest of those
who are well is present, albeit apparently somewhat slight
and casual. The interest of those who are sick is intense, but
transitory; when they are well their interest tends to lessen.
The interest of those who are well but who think they
are sick is constant and pitiful; they form the substance on
which the "patent medicine" mongers have thrived since
time immemorial; they constitute, in large part, the great
audience for false prophets of health, as well as for those
who are attempting to give honest information about the
body and its care in health and in disease.
Nineteen thirty witnessed the appearance on the literary
scene of several biographies of Bernarr Macfadden, one of
them indeed almost a self-revelation, since it came from the
pen of Fulton Oursler, adviser to the Macfadden publica
tions, and so intimate with their control that his wife has
published her chats with the Macfadden family. As Allene
Tamley remarks in a consideration of these three opera in
the Outlook, "There has never in our history been a national
hero so important as to rate three biographies in a single

day." True, Washington, Lincoln, and Roosevelt have been
favorably mentioned, and indeed unfavorably on various
occasions, but the great Bernarr bursts upon the scene like
a charge of T.N.T.
Our hero greeted the morning sun on a hot August day in
1868 near the village of Mill Spring, Missouri. Both parents
died before he was eight years old. Successfully overcoming
the common diseases of childhood, he ran off to St. Louis
and began to develop himself in a gymnasium. The records
reveal that he was no mean opponent on a wrestling mat.
With this background he began to promote himself as a
"kinistherapist." A kinistherapist, for the information of my
readers, is a person who treats muscles or who concerns him
self with their motions. By 1899, when he was 31 years old,
our hero had already begun to display for an interested
public those poses of his body which revealed vast areas of
cutaneous tissue, and which have made him known since
that day as "Body Love Macfadden."
In his earlier publications he associated his promotion of
physical culture with advertisements for various cures, with
announcements of hair culture, and with insinuations re
garding available books on delicate subjects. Gradually this
publication evolved into Physical Culture. Quite promptly
he attracted the attention of that protector of public morals,
Anthony Comstock. Raids on his New York office resulted in
removal to New Jersey, where he was arrested and charged
with sending lewd and obscene matter through the mails.
For this he received a sentence of two years' imprisonment
and a fine of $2,000. Eventually the sentence was remitted,
but the Government has not yet returned the $2,000.
With this introduction, let us consider some of the med
ical notions promulgated in what is alleged to be a non
medical periodical, namely, Mr. Bernarr Macfadden's Phys
ical Culture. The type of fiction and general literature
issuing from the Macfadden press is another story. If Mr.
Macfadden were to content himself purely with preaching
the gospel of simple diet and adequate exercise, one could

have no fault to find with him, except that he utilizes the
erotic appeal in his teachings.
The manner in which the sex appeal is used by the
Macfadden periodicals has been duly criticized by numer
ous observers, and perhaps nowhere else so well as by
N. H. Bowen, in a brief discussion in the Detroit Saturday
Night.
Mr. Bowen says, in a consideration of the Macfadden
string of periodicals: "The important thing to note is that
in every one of these stories the suggestion is of something
relative to sex; in fact, these two magazines reek of sex."
It needs no reading of the Macfadden publications to
convince any sound observer that their appeal is primarily
sexual and erotic. The covers, invariably in the gaudiest of
colors, are devoted to pictures of women in various stages
of nudity, usually sufficient, however, to avoid conflict with
the postal authorities. The illustrations place emphasis on
the beauties of the salacious and the cabaret, rather than on
the higher types of art which have less sex appeal. Even the
illustrations of the crude stories that form the basis of the
Macfadden literature are the old male and female struggle
type or the slow fadeout rigid clasp that featured the movies
in their earlier and rawer stages.
The fiction of the Macfadden periodicals is quite fre
quently of the so-called confession type. Perhaps these con
fessions are true, but if they are, their appeal lies, not in
their truth nor in any moral lesson that they may teach, but
in their essential suggestiveness. Of literary value they have
none, and their duration is as evanescent as the paper on
which they are printed.
However, we are concerned here not so much with the
exceedingly low scale to which the Macfadden literature is
pitched, as with the false campaign of health which his
periodicals promote.
It does not suffice Mr. Macfadden to prove that good
health may be achieved through proper diet and proper
exercise; he seems to have felt that in promoting these de
siderata he must attack those phases of the scientific care of

the body that lie within the purview of the scientifically
trained physician. In Physical Culture, he has attacked pri
marily those who use methods and knowledge which are not
available to him through the fact that the law is inclined
to protect the public by guaranteeing to some extent the
sanctity of the M.D. degree.
In his campaign, Bernarr Macfadden aligned himself with
the border-line cultists that oppose scientific medicine and
devote themselves to the promotion of some single concep
tion of disease causation, prevention, and treatment.
One finds him promoting actively the interests of the
manipulative cults, including chiropractic and osteopathy;
of the Abramsites, with their fantastic electronic conception;
of the naturopathic cult, with its emphasis on barefoot walk
ing in the morning dew; of colonic flushing with its filling
stations and vegetable diet; of the antivaccinationists and
antivivisectionists; of the fanatical groups that feel that their
personal beliefs are more important than the good of the
community; and, indeed, of any of the extraordinary fads
which have risen for a moment above the horizon of med
ical practice only to sink rapidly into oblivion.
One goes through volume after volume of the health
faddist's monitor and selects therefrom articles showing how
Mr. Bernarr Macfadden has lent himself to the promotion of
dozens of now discredited notions. This, however, is unneces
sary at this time, since Macfadden has himself indicated his
willingness to promote every new notion —it would be
beyond the mark to call them ideas. It is, moreover, neces
sary only to refer to a few issues of Physical Culture to see
the type of science which Mr. Macfadden is willing to accept.
In one number, one finds a defense of the now completely
discredited Albert Abrams, by the completely deluded
Upton Sinclair; a defense of naturopathy, by Bernarr
Macfadden; and a defense of the unestablished views of
W. H. Bates, who believes that it is possible to train a de
formed eye to see without glasses, again by no less an author
ity than Bernarr himself.
There is also an article showing that bobbing of the hair

makes women bald, without the slightest basis in scientific
proof —certainly with no actual evidence.
Moreover, two issues contain a symposium devoted to the
triumphs of osteopathy, without any recognition of the fact
that it never has been shown that the very conditions which
form the basis of osteopathy actually exist.
With a peculiar disregard of his own constant and un
warranted attack on medical science, Mr. Macfadden has
employed, to bolster his views, such physicians as are willing
to take a few dollars for writing articles for the Macfadden
magazines.
It should be obvious to any logical-minded man that a
physician who has even an ordinary ability to interpret what
he reads will know that the Macfadden periodicals have
been devoted largely to an attack on scientific medicine, and
to discrediting not only the modern treatment of disease but
also the campaigns for the prevention of disease carried on
by scientific medicine. These campaigns, history shows defi
nitely, have cleared up the plague spots of the world and re
sulted in the saving of millions of lives wherever they have
been applied. It should be obvious to any physician that the
lending of his name and his M.D. degree to the periodicals
of Mr. Macfadden constitutes a definite departure from his
scientific training, and certainly from the ethical ideals
which were conferred on him with his medical education.
It is perhaps the boast of Mr. Macfadden that he has been
able to secure a few —fortunately only a pitiful few —phy
sicians who are willing to contribute to his pernicious
propaganda.
Those who have, on occasion, looked into a Macfadden
periodical turned but a few pages until they came upon a
photograph of the "Bare Torso King" —to confer on him
the title originally conferred by the Detroit Saturday Night.
Time calls him "Body-Love" Macfadden.
There he stands, almost in the garb with which nature
clad him, a majestic figure with lungs inflated and pompa
dour defying the world. His skin, if we are to believe his
own accounts, is full of vigor and strength. But apparently

PHYSICAL CULTURE, BERNARR MACFADDEN
the attacks that have been made on his motives, if not on
his facts, have been sufficient to pierce even a skin strength
ened by all of the methods known to the apostles of physical
culture.
In particular, Mr. Macfadden was worried some years
ago by an editorial which appeared in the Ladies' Home
Journal, in which the editor of that long established period
ical called attention to the evil that is being spread by sex
publications. Mr. Macfadden's defense is to claim that many
of the great health campaigns for which the Ladies' Home
Journal is renowned were his own innovation. With colossal
impudence he states that Physical Culture began twenty-five
years ago to expose the patent medicine takers, and that the
Ladies' Home Journal took up the fight only after Physical
Culture had started.
And this in a periodical which has always reeked with the
advertisements of nostrums and fallacious health systems!
It is claimed further that Physical Culture originated the
campaign against venereal disease. And this in a periodical
which by its refusal to recognize the scientific facts concern
ing venereal disease may contribute to the spread of these
diseases.
It is the belief of at least many editors that the Macfadden
periodicals, with their sex stimulation and appeal, promote
unchastity. The refusal to recognize that such conditions
as gonorrhea and syphilis are caused by definite bacterial and
parasitic organisms will help to prevent the dissemination of
knowledge as to the way in which these diseases may be
prevented through the use of antiseptic substances. It is this
Macfadden who claims that he has contributed greatly to the
war on venereal disease!
It was the view of the intelligent Greeks that the human
body well taken care of is a holy and spiritual thing. The
laws of health and hygiene which they promoted were such
as bring the body to a high state of perfection and discourage
immodesty and salaciousness in relation to health. The Mac
fadden gospel is essentially an appeal to a large minority of
persons whose eyes are aroused by the flash of nakedness or

whose weakened wills succumb to every new health fad. He
has taken what should be a beautiful search for health, for
vigor, and for strength, and made of it an ugly and dis
couraging thing to every right-minded individual.
GLUTTONS FOR EXERCISE
The Macfadden gospel is primarily the belief that big
muscles are synonymous with health and that exercise is the
road to this goal. One of the difficulties with the whole
physical culture and athletic movement has been the cre
ation of outdoor fanatics, marathon runners, hundred mile
pedestrians, and similar enthusiasts who believe that the
road to health lies in the exceptional performance rather
than in well conducted and suitably regulated physical
activities.
One of the most amusing performances ever witnessed by
the people of these United States, directly or in the movies,
was the cross-country marathon promoted by C. C. Pyle. In
this foot race from Los Angeles to New York, some 200 run
ners started, and about a quarter of this number finished the
3000 mile grind. Just what that was planned to prove, or just
what relationship it might have to the general subject of
health, has not yet become apparent.
No doubt, the one hundred mile walker is a healthful
person or he could not walk a hundred miles, but the aver
age man has little occasion to walk one hundred miles and
does not need the hundred mile equipment. Man, like other
domesticated animals, did not always live indoors. Modern
investigations indicate that a certain amount of time out
doors is beneficial to health. But outdoor exercise to the
point of overfatigue, of irritating sunburn, or of undue ex
posure to the elements is likely to do as much harm as good.
Various authorities have suggested the amounts of muscu
lar activity desirable for persons of various ages. Hethering-
ton of the University of California suggested four hours of
muscular activity at the age of five years, five hours from
seven to nine, six hours from nine to eleven, five hours from
eleven to thirteen, four hours from thirteen to sixteen, three

hours from sixteen to eighteen, and two hours daily from
eighteen to twenty as the proper amounts.
Williams states that one hour should be given daily to
activities involving the use of the large muscles of the body
after 20 years of age, and that anything less than that will
result in physical deterioration.
Men should not live for the muscles alone. Think of
Sandow! Think even of Bernarr Macfadden! And when you
think of them, what have you got? But maybe some people
want to be Sandows and Macfaddens.
Calisthenics, daily dozens, and similar exercises are valu
able within limitations, but our tendency is to become exer
cise fanatics if we do not become fanatics about something
else. The tendency is dangerous. There is no royal road to
health by means of any daily dozen, or any other exercise
formula promoted by some former trainer of prizefighters
with the aid of good advertising agencies.
The chief advantages of exercise are that the body's gen
eral chemistry and physiology are stimulated, the circula
tion is aided, and the elimination encouraged.
There are no magical formulas in exercise that will guar
antee freedom from disease or the presence of what is com
monly called "pep," vim, vigor, and vitality. The latter char
acteristics seem to be just as much a part of the mental dis
position as of the physical state. Keeping young, vigorous
and happy depends largely on one's state of mind.
After all, what does the average person accomplish by his
exercise? The physiologists have found that a healthful man,
with well developed muscles, who is working very hard, can
sustain an average output of about one-tenth horse power for
eight or ten hours. If he works himself up to an output of
two-tenths horse power, he is exhausted in two or three
hours. Expert rowers in racing shells can work up to five-
tenths or six-tenths horse power, but they are all through
after 20 minutes.
An automobile engine or any kind of motor gets far more
done with less wear and tear on the machine than occurs
with the human machine. For 10 or 15 seconds, the amount

of time required for a 100-yard dash, a human being can
develop, according to Haggard, as much as three to three
and a half horse power. But what of it? Any kind of an au
tomobile engine does better than 20 horse power.
THE SHAKING MACHINES
About 1
857 a Swedish physician named Dr. Gustav Zander
began to use mechanical means for massage and exercise.
These machines were the first ever used for the purpose.
Since that time various devices have been developed, includ
ing the hobby horse, popularized by Mr. Coolidge, and all
sorts of vibrators, shakers, and springs, as well as machines
for manipulating and vibrating the muscles of the human
body.
In a consideration of the use of these machines, the Coun
cil on Physical Therapy of the American Medical Associa
tion condemns them, although not unreservedly, for several
reasons. In the first place, it is felt that the psychology that
their use develops in the patient is wrong, since they con
vey the impression that the machine has curative qualities
and that it is unnecessary for the patient to do anything,
but that he can leave everything to the machine.
It is argued that the machine will accomplish things that
cannot be accomplished by simple exercise, but in the in
stance of extra fat around the waist actually better results
are accomplished by leg and abdominal exercises without
apparatus, and better results for weight reduction can be
accomplished by a walk or slow run in the fresh air. The
machines treat only one part of the body at a time and do
not have the advantage of general exercise in developing
other parts of the body.
Indeed, the Council on Physical Therapy points out that
vibratory massage of the abdomen with a strap attached to
a motor for ten minutes cannot give as much benefit as a
ten minute fast walk with conscious effort given to holding
in the stomach and abdomen.
The tendency is for people to become very tired promptly

XII
THE BIG MUSCLE BOYS
"Although men are accused for not knowing their own weakness, yet
perhaps as few know their own strength." —Jonathan Swift.
Turning
the pages of a periodical like Physical Culture,
or noting the pages devoted to sport in our daily press,
one might become impressed with the notion that the chief
goal of man is muscle. Not that Bernarr Macfadden, the
"Bare Torso King" neglects the mind, for in the Macfadden
string of periodicals was one known as National Brain
Power.
But most of the great gospel is the lauding of strength
both as a means and an end —of strength for strength's
sake. And not just ordinary strength, but the kind of strength
that bends crowbars between the teeth, bites chains in two,
lifts a team of horses and carries five or six men posed in
artistic designs, while giving huge grunts to the accompani
ment of an orchestra.
Once upon a time there was only one "Bare Torso King,"
the pictures of whose powerful frame thrilled the multi
tude as he appeared clad only in a breech clout, with fists
clenched and gorilla-like chest pumped out like that of a
pouter pigeon. But nowadays as one turns the pages, he
comes upon coupon after coupon, inviting him to subscribe,
urging him to inquire, pleading with him to be strong.
As the reader scans the advertising literature and the
other material that he receives when he sends the coupon,
he will observe a remarkable sameness. He will derive from

his observations certain fundamental opinions as to why
the exponents of muscularity are engaged in the business of
selling muscle-building courses and as to the kind of persons
who fall for such courses.
He will probably discover that there is a peculiar appeal
in the portrait of the nude that is cleverly worked on by the
bare torso gentlemen to secure their clients. He will find,
no doubt, that these gentlemen are not suffering inordi
nately from modesty as to their own accomplishments, and
he will probably become convinced that their business is
one that is profitable.
Let us first glance over a few of the leaders in this unique
occupation.
INTRODUCING L. W. ALBIZU
Consider first Prof. L. W. Albizu. He is—or was—the in
ventor of the Roller Dumb-Bells —"The World's Quickest
Way to Strength." He has a system; in fact, each of the bare
torso gentlemen has a system, and Professor Albizu admits
in connection with the exploitation of his system that he is
"the sensation of the physical culture world."
Apparently all that you have to do to become strong by
the professor's method is to roll his dumb-bells up and down
the wall. He does not give you a diploma, and he empha
sizes this fact because some of the big muscle men do give
you a diploma. Professor Albizu gives you a health and
strength course at $20 cash or $22 on time, and, with it, you
get a pair of dumb-bells —or perhaps you are a dumb-bell —
who knows?
Of course, he has a question blank, because mail-order
physical culture, these gentlemen all carefully explain, can
only be properly conducted on those who are sufficiently
healthful to stand the rigors of the exercise. Still it is adver
tised to make the weak man strong. But Professor Albizu is
not unduly curious. Chiefly, he wants to know your meas
urements, if you have ruptures, if your neck is short or long,
and if your collar bone shows when you stand naturally.

INTRODUCING CHARLES ATLAS
Alphabetically next comes Charles Atlas. Somehow Atlas
is such a good name for a strong man that one hesitates to
believe it a real one; but maybe it is.
Atlas has occupied many a page with his advertisements
in the physical culture magazines. He offers "Health—Domi
nating, Wealth-Winning Health." He emphasizes "Big Pow
erful Muscles," and he tells you that Atlas-trained men are
"Personality" men. "My system," says Mr. Atlas, "is the last
word in Health and Energy Building." "I give only actual
instructions, high-powered secrets (all of these mail-order
Samsons have secrets) that do get the quick and certain re
sults. And who could be Better qualified to teach you these
amazing secrets than the World's Most Perfect Man?" Curi
ously, each of these bare torso gentlemen is the world's most
perfect man. Or is that Clark Gable?
So you clip the coupon and send for "Secrets of Muscular
Power and Beauty." It's free—absolutely free. "Scores upon
scores of vital, inspiring pages of information and beautiful
art pictures yours FREE." (All of these bare torso gentlemen
emphasize the beautiful art pictures that are free.) We will
not try to duplicate the different kinds and sizes of type that
an Atlas advertisement uses; our printers might object. But
besides the type, there is a little insert that tells you about
your chances to get free "seven large photographs of myself"
as well as "cash prizes, expensive trophies, and beautiful
diplomas." Where is the farmer's boy or the dry goods clerk
that could resist an appeal like that?
The reader sends the coupon and the Atlas book comes.
A letter comes also with more capital letters than a Hearst
editorial. Charles Atlas tells you in the mimeographed per
sonal letter that he himself is full of "boundless energy,"
"great power," "wonderful strength," and "radiant, vibrant
health." He is glad "for your sake" that he has it and can
transmit it to you. No apparatus is required. He pleads with
you to send $30 cash or $35 on time in payments for his
course. To prove to you how good he is, he encloses some

circulars showing four or five other gentlemen with clenched
fists, puffed out chests, and breech clouts, breaking up iron
chains and poising for Ajax defying the lightning. These
bare torso gentlemen, it seems, are graduates of Mr. Atlas'
course. And ah! how Mr. Atlas pleads with you in connec
tion with each of these photographs. Indeed, he rises at last
to these heights of beautiful sentimentalism:
WHAT WILL THEY THINK OF YOU?
Your sweetheart —you know what kind of a man she ex
pects you to be. Are you going to disappoint her? Will you
let all her dreams about her lover fall to the ground? She
wants you to be a virile, manly man, full of strength and
power, able to protect her. Your mother—she expected great
things of you. She hoped you'd grow up a splendid example
of vigorous manhood. Don't let her hopes of you be shat
tered. Resolve now to make something of yourself. Refuse
to be a weakling. Health and strength can now be yours.
The confidential question blank with the questions com
piled by Mr. Atlas, or his advertising agent, seems to be cal
culated particularly to appeal to the psychasthenic and
hypochondriac.
Mr. Atlas wants to know, among other things, if you are
"nervous or fearful?" "Despondent, angry, worried, irritable
at times?" (Who isn't?) "Have you any harmful habits you
wish to overcome?" (This is the old appeal, based on ancient
beliefs as to the dangers of certain sexual habits.) "Is your
will power weak or strong?" "Are you sexually weak?" "Are
you timid, shy, bashful?" And so on and so on!
And then, "If you really crave Superpower, Glorious
Health, Uncanny Strength, Tremendous Nerve Force and
a Perfectly Developed Body Mail This Enrollment Blank
Right now."
So much for Mr. Atlas!

given him "such marvelous strength that people refer to me
as the Superman of the Ages."
We warned you, reader, that these bemuscled gentlemen
were in no sense to be compared with the modest violet.
But Mr. Breitbart shames the chrysanthemum or the rhodo
dendron:
There is nothing else like my method and there is nothing
else that will as surely or quickly give you the big, bulging
muscles and crushing strength that every red-blooded man
wants.
See what I have been able to accomplish myself, by the
use of this system. I support more weight than any other
man. I drive heavy nails through many layers of oak and
iron with my bare hands. My muscles are trained. I am able
to bend heavy steel bars into carefully worked designs. I per
form feats of strength that astonish thousands with the sheer
power of muscle that my system has given me; and this same
method can give the same power to you.
Like Mr. Atlas, Mr. Breitbart has secrets; he not only has
his own secrets, but he admits that he knows everybody
else's secrets. And he continues, "mine is a new and far better
method, unlike any you have ever seen or heard."
All you need to do is to send for Mr. Breitbart's new
book. He has been offered real money for this book, he tells
you, but he is willing to give it to you for a dime to cover
the cost of mailing. Send him a dime at once, and you will
get not only his book but also "Breitbart's Muscle Meter"
FREE.
As can be imagined, for your dime you get quite a pack
age. You get first Mr. Breitbart's book entitled "Muscular
Power," showing on its cover Mr. Breitbart in the act of
pulling open a tiger's mouth. Now that's the kind of ac
complishment so many of us need; Mr. Breitbart does this
sort of thing quite as a matter of routine.
Next you get to see a picture of Keith's Theater in which
Mr. Breitbart performed; then you get to see Mr. Breitbart

and his muscles from the waist up, including, also, a most
aggressive pompadour.
Then comes the text matter with such headings as "Muscle
Rules the World," which tells you that exercise and muscle
building make success. By this time, evidently fearing that
he may be thought a braggart, Mr. Breitbart coyly makes
this little disclaimer:
J do not wish to be thought egotistical or go about shout
ing and blowing my own horn. I leave such praise to others
and I hold myself far above such cheap and unbecoming
practices. I determined in this book to let others tell you all
about myself.
Then follow page after page of clippings about Mr. Breit
bart and photographs of Mr. Breitbart when Mr. Breitbart
was on the vaudeville stage. There is Breitbart breaking a
heavy iron chain with bare hands —with a closeup of the
chain —Breitbart bending and coiling a one-half inch thick
iron bar around his arms with bare hands, Breitbart biting
through a heavy iron chain which six husky men were un
able to break apart; Breitbart resting on a bed of nails sup
porting a bridge with a man and an ox weighing over a
ton.
And so on and on and on interminably: Breitbart after
Breitbart —and muscle after muscle, until at last one comes
to the pages of testimonials and the photographs of the pu
pils, and the final plea to "Fill out and mail the enrollment
blank at once."
We are convinced that Charles Atlas was the world's most
famous man, but here is Mr. Breitbart's claim.
Muscle by muscle, inch by inch, Breitbart easily outstrips
every claimant to Strength and physical development—
surely he is the Superman of the Ages.
Nevertheless, Charles MacMahon of Philadelphia, about
whom we shall speak later, outstrips Breitbart —he doesn't
even wear a breech clout.

that you paste around your biceps muscle. Then you bend
your arm and if your muscle is as big as Mr. Breitbart's you
can break the paper. We refer here not to the strength of
the muscle but to its volume. Mr. Breitbart's isn't stingy. He
gives you a paper tape measure in addition to the "muscle
meter," and he gives you a money-order blank all filled out
ready to send him $25 cash or $26 on time. Mr. Breitbart
also has a confidential information blank in which he in
quires if you are subject to colds, asks about your appetite,
and if your temperament is nervous and emotional, or quiet
and steady. Naturally Mr. Breitbart has to know these things
to plan your course.
INTRODUCING EARL LIEDERMAN
Mr. Earl Liederman offers you ten more years of life. "I
don't claim to cure disease," he says. "I am not a medical
doctor but I'll put you in such condition that the doctor will
starve to death waiting for you to take sick."
Earl Liederman fixes you up in ninety days and he re
quires two pages of advertisements to tell you about it—
one devoted to Mr. Liederman au naturel and the other to
his announcement. When Mr. Liederman is through with
you, you are a real man, he says. He tells you about your
deep, full chest, your huge, square shoulders, your massive,
muscular arms, the flash to your eye, and the pep to your
step.
All you have to do is to send for his booklet "Muscular
Development." It contains, as by this time you will have
come to expect, forty-three full page photographs of himself
and his pupils. There are the bare torso photographs in
every conceivable posture, and there are six bare torso
pupils. Then, at last, there is a letter asking $28 in cash or
on time. It is the same old postal money-order blank, the
same old imitation personal letter, the same old questions
and the same old mention of the necessary apparatus. And,
if you fail to bite, finally there come to you week by week
the same old follow-up letters.

THE BIG MUSCLE BOYS
CHARLES MACMAHON
You have been told that Charles MacMahon outstrips
them all—at least so far as shown by the pictures in his
little booklet. As you might easily have anticipated he has a
little booklet. All the mail order Herculeses have little book
lets. If you sent for Charles MacMahon's little booklet, it
was probably in response to the "ad" in which he cautions
you not to be a "flat tire."
All of the emphasis in the "ad" is on flatness. If you have
a flat chest, he offers to puff you up; if you have flat feet, if
you have a flat pocketbook —but no, it seems he doesn't fix
flat pocketbooks. He merely says that ill health means a flat
pocketbook and he is going to save you all the expense that
ill health entails by putting you in A-i physical condition.
Indeed, flatness appears to be an obsession with Charles
MacMahon: "I Flatly Refuse to Let You Pay One Cent,"
he says in big type, but he continues in little type "either on
my booklet, my pamphlet, or toward defraying my expenses
of wrapping, postage and the labor of getting them to you."
But when you do get them, then comes your opportunity to
spend money.
First, there comes the page of bare torsoed gentlemen
who—we are asked to believe—have taken the MacMahon
course; also the testimonials of these Samsons. Next there
is the little booklet entitled "The Royal Road to Health and
Strength" by Charles MacMahon. Here and there among the
many photos of Mr. MacMahon which illuminate every
other page, one finds remarkable statements. For instance on
page 6, the text reads:
A man with a squarely built, well muscled waist rarely
suffers from disease of the digestive and dissimilative organs.
We have been trying to find out what a dissimilative organ
is; the word intrigues us.
Charles MacMahon learned his technic from the Hindu
wrestlers, so he says, and he specializes on the legs and the
waist. This is Charles MacMahon's "system." All the bare

torso gentlemen have "systems" in every sense of that un
usual word. He also has an apparatus, although not a rubber
or a spring apparatus. You may have noted that these expo
nents of the science of physical culture have been unable
to agree on the desirability of apparatus or on any one ap
paratus. Indeed, no two of them have agreed. Every bare
torso king has an apparatus all his own.
Mr. MacMahon offers you nine separate lessons at inter
vals of ten days. With each lesson you get a set of separate
pictures. The price is $30 and includes the necessary appara
tus. If you pay $24 cash, you get the new $30 tumbling and
hand-balancing course free. Suppose you don't accept right
away. Let us tip you off. It will be to your advantage. Wait
for the second, or third, or fourth, or fifth offer. If you wait
long enough Mr. MacMahon throws in more courses, per
sonal service, and a magazine subscription.
Finally, may we point out that the MacMahon question
blank asks only for measurements and doesn't even make a
pretence of finding out if the applicant ought to be indulging
in strenuous exercises? Perhaps it is quite suitable for Mr.
MacMahon to lift up the columns of buildings and to toss
around 200 pound weights. But how about the man with
high blood pressure, arteriosclerosis, or disease of the heart?
Does Mr. MacMahon care? Or does he take the attitude that
the fellow who wants to spend $30 and take a chance at rup
turing a blood vessel or "overstraining his heart should have
that privilege?
MICHAEL MCFADDEN
This gentleman modestly admits that he is the "Champion
of Champions." His name is McFadden. For $8 he sells you
the McFadden Patented 10 Cable Progressive Exerciser. He
offers also the Patented Progressive Handles, the Patented
Progressive Stirrup, the Patented Progressive Head Gear,
twelve weeks' Home Instruction Course, "most wonderful
ever written —the kind you cannot get elsewhere" —more
secrets, you see! —and finally the Michael McFadden En

All of this, which he alleges is worth $30, he offers for a
trivial $8, and he guarantees to increase your biceps one full
inch in from thirty to ninety days and all other parts of
your body in proportion. What! All parts? What, hoi His
guarantee, he says, is backed by a $10,000 challenge. Further
than this deponent sayeth not!
His saffron colored circular shows some fourteen bare
torso gentlemen in various stages of bareness, presumably
all brought into muscular beatitude by exercising regularly
with the McFadden Patent High Tension 10 Cable Progres
sive Exerciser, with a resistance of 10 to 200 pounds. One
thing about Mr. Michael McFadden—if you don't answer
him right away he apparently is willing to let you suffer.
You will not have your mail box cluttered up by the weekly
or semiweekly follow-up letters. Mr. McFadden lays little
stress on his course; his stock in trade seems to be chiefly
the name that one conjures with in the mail-order physical
culture world and the Patented High Tension 10 Cable
Progressive Exerciser and other "Progressive" things.
INTRODUCING LIONEL
Of all the mail-order strong men Lionel Strongfort most
merits discussion in matters of health, for he appeals to the
fears of the sick and the neurasthenic to a greater extent than
do any of the others. The literature that he circulates and
his follow-up letters emphasize sexual weakness to the point
of nausea. It would be unsuitable to reprint them even for
the sake of proof. Letter after letter in his series emphasizes
sex and virility and lost manhood. Evidently the promoters
of "Strongfortism" have found that there are a sufficient
number of psychasthenics with fears as to their sexual powers
to make the appeal a drawing one.
The Strongfort course is built around his resistance in
creasing dumb-bell, "a triumph in athletic apparatus."
"The Strongfort is without doubt the handsomest dumb
bell on the market," urge the circulars.
The Strongfort question blank is about like the others,

except for this question, masterly in its barefaced, impudent
departure from the facts:
Any white spots under your finger nails?
(Indicating Uric Acid in the system)
There is an attempt to play upon the old uric acid buga
boo by frightening everyone who has white spots on his
finger nails. And who doesn't have them at one time or an
other? The fact that the white spots have no more to do with
uric acid than with carbolic acid doesn't worry Strongfort.
Besides, the Strongfort blank again and again emphasizes
"secret habits," "virility," "night losses," and other sexual
matters.
The Strongfort booklet —he has a booklet —is a remark
able concoction of mendacity, attacking well-nigh every
thing except Strongfortism so far as relates to health and the
control of disease. It is illustrated by the usual bare torso
photographs, the oak leaf serving the demands of modesty
furnished in the other bare torso booklets by the surcingle,
leopard skin, or air brush of the photoengraver. The key
note of Strongfortism, aside from the "Resistance Increasing
Dumb-bells," is "internal and external muscular harmony."
Once everyone has achieved this desideratum by the course
and the dumb-bells, the millennium will be reached. Follow
ing are a few modest Strongfortisms:
Strongfortism is a panacea for all habits that arise from
physical weakness, as all bad habits do, because Strongfort
ism builds up Strength that resists such habits. There would
be no need for Prohibition laws on liquor or any other vices
if everybody practiced Strongfortism.
Strongfortism is the key which unlocks Nature's store
house of vital energy. It reaches and develops the inner
muscles which control the vital organs, generating the Life
Forces.
The weakling is developed and inspired with the mastery
of mental power and physical perfection —the glorious crown
of MANHOOD. The dyspeptic and neurotic, whose system
is racked by disease, finds rebirth in the quickening pulse of
a revitalized body, vibrant with health and energy.

THE BIG MUSCLE BOYS
A person who is rendered immune through a course in
Strongfortism is safe against colds, epidemics, and all kinds
of diseases, whether catching or otherwise, simply because
his internal system is in harmony with the external—every
set of muscles works one with the other—every organ is
regular and this rhythmical kinetical action gives a volume
of vital force which repels every kind of disease. It is the
man in ill health or whose vitality is low that is susceptible
to catarrh and all kinds of diseases.
Of all the preposterous medical hokum we have ever read,
nothing has crossed our vision to equal that appearing in
the literature of Mr. Strongfort. If ever superlatives were
justified they are justified in discussing his work in relation
to that of the other bare torso gentlemen in this series. Ac
cording to our investigation:
He puts the most stress on sex.
He attacks the most other instructors.
He sends the most follow-up letters.
He makes the most medical claims.
He makes the most extravagant promises.
In only one way is he outstripped and that, as has been
mentioned, by Mr. Charles MacMahon.
PROF. H. W. TITUS
Here we are at Professor Titus, last of the series, and ready
to confess that reading the claims of these physical culture
mail order promoters has made us tired. We have apparently
overexercised. We get no kick out of the literature of Pro
fessor Titus.
The fact that he announces himself as "The Most Success
ful Director of Physical and Health Culture in America"
does not seem to thrill us. When he asks, "Do you take pride
in your personal appearance?" our flagging energy does not
revive. His offer of a complete course of Lessons with the
Progressive and Automatic Exerciser for $15 down, $5 in
thirty days, and remaining $5 in sixty days does not strike
our fancy. Even the yellow ten dollar reduction check that
comes with the fourth or fifth follow-up letter makes no ap

peal. Actually the literature and the claims of all of these
bare torso gentlemen leave us in a muddle.
One of them curses roundly all other courses that use
apparatus; the spring apparatus proponents vilify the rubber
band stretchers; the rubber band stretchers attack the spring
benders; the dumb-bell workers roast the spring benders
and the rubber stretchers; the roller dumb-bell advertiser
says the standing dumb-bells are worthless, and the standing
dumb-bell promoter announces vigorously that they won't
roll off the table. Mr. Strongfort tells us that anybody that
bites chains in two is a fake; Mr. Breitbart shows how he
bites the chains; Mr. MacMahon develops the waist muscles
—that's the secret—but Mr. Strongfort develops the internal
muscles; then, too, you will remember Mr. MacMahon con
cerns himself with the "dissimilative" organs.
If we are to indulge in these strenuous exercises and in
door sports, why not find out first through some sort of
physical examination whether or not we are fitted to under
take the stunts of these physical culture professors? Mr.
Thomas Rice of the Brooklyn Eagle has recently looked into
the control of these mail order physical culture courses and
the muscle-exploiting gymnasiums. He says:
Under present conditions, anybody may set himself up as
a physical culturist. Not only that, he may advise his clients,
or whatever he may choose to call them, to pursue a course
that must inevitably shorten their lives, and no check at all
may be placed upon him.
Any boxer, wrestler, football player, runner, shotputter,
etc., who has passed out of competition is privileged to open
a gymnasium and tell the world that he is capable of giving
fit
instruction to all comers, regardless
of
their present appar
ent health or their past history. . .
.
What may be excellent for the athletes in their prime
may be dangerous for the immature boys, and may be abso
lutely fatal for the middle-aged and elderly, but hundreds,
if
not thousands,
of
the "professors" do not know that, and
many would not care
a
hoot
if
they did, so long as young,
middle-aged, and elderly paid their fees promptly.

deal to do with the work of the big muscle boys.
Ah, well! Enough of this! The great outdoors beckons;

THE ANTIVIVISECTIONIST
AND ANIMAL EXPERIMENTATION
"Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves longer." —Patrick Henry.
George
Jean Nathan, in that immortal document, "Pis
tols for Two," in which he and Mons. Mencken, using
the cognomen Maj. Owen Hatteras, gave to an unsuspecting
world an insight into their personal characters and charac
teristics, tells us which of his aphorisms delights him most.
Of all the soul-searching mots perpetrated by this astute
coiner of phrases, the one he selected is likewise the one
that gives me most joy. "An antivivisectionist," said Dr.
Nathan, "is a woman who strains at a guinea pig and swal
lows a baby." There it is in a nutshell! A Freudian might
claim that the term "nutshell" was prominent in my mind
because I was discussing the antivivisectionist.
At a period when the whole world begins to turn to sci
ence as the real goal of mankind; when intelligent human
beings begin to discard pseudosentiment for fact, the fol
lowers of what is essentially merely an illogical, fanatical
cult continue to oppose progress if it is to involve in any way
what they conceive to be abuse of the lower animals for pur
poses of study. This opposition seems to rest invariably on a
lack of actual knowledge of what animal experimentation
has accomplished for mankind, of what it has contributed to
the life and comfort of the animal, of the extent to which
the animal may suffer in the cause of experimentation, and

of the very rules which the scientists themselves have elabo
rated to safeguard their work with animals.
It is impossible in the scope of a brief article even to
enumerate all that has been learned by animal experimenta
tion. Without the aid of this method Pasteur could not have
founded the science of bacteriology; such diseases as hydro
phobia, tuberculosis, yellow fever, plague, scarlet fever, diph
theria, and diabetes would not have passed under the control
of scientific medicine but would have continued to take
their immense toll of life and to cause immeasurable eco
nomic loss through illness. Indeed, to calculate the sums
saved and earned through preventing illness, through open
ing up countries constantly menaced by disease, through the
building of the Panama Canal, and through the saving of
workers in industry would produce a figure so vast as to be
almost incredible.
BIOLOGIC ASSAY
In the course of the great campaign for the use of experi
ments on animals to control human diseases, little attention
has been given in general to the great problems of what
scientists know as biologic assay. Almost everyone realizes
the part played by animal experimentation in the provision
of information.relative to the functions of living bodies. Ex
periments made on animals have helped scientists to know
how the heart is controlled by the nervous system, how the
blood pressure is maintained, and how the nerves send forth
stimuli and bring back sensation. These facts once learned,
it is not necessary to repeat the experiments on innumerable
animals, and scientists do not engage in wanton dissections
for such purposes.
Equally important, however, from the point of view of
the human being, is the constant use of experimental ani
mals to determine the potency of drug preparations, to test
the value of vaccines and serums, and to establish the safety
of other life-giving substances used for the control of disease
in the human body. All these things are involved in the proc
ess known as standardization; thus, exceedingly important

remedies for diseases of the heart known as digitalis, stroph
antus, and squill must be standardized by methods known
as the frog, cat, and guinea pig methods, in which definite
doses of the drug preparations are injected into such animals.
The substance known as pituitary extract, which has
saved millions of hours of suffering for women in childbirth,
must be tested on the organs of guinea pigs or cats before
its powers to produce certain definite effects are definitely
known. Insulin, the substance used to aid the diabetic in the
digestion of sugar, is standardized by use in rats and rabbits.
Salvarsan and similar drugs used in the control of syphilis
and African sleeping sickness must be tested on mice and
rats before it can be distributed for the control of these dis
eases in human beings. Even ergot, known for centuries to
have value in aiding the control of hemorrhage after the
birth of a child, is now thoroughly tested as to its various
and possibly poisonous qualities on animals before it is sold
for use on human beings.
The preparation of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin could
not be carried on without the use of the rabbit; the use of
smallpox vaccine is dependent on the use of the calf and
the pig, and, indeed, every preparation made to combat in
fections by germs must be standardized in some manner on
living tissue before the physician could consider for a mo
ment the use of such a preparation on a human being.
Shall the poisonous doses of potent drugs be learned by
tests made on the white rat or the guinea pig or on man; or
worse still, shall we permit men to die or suffer mutilation
to spare the feelings of the white mouse? Isn't it after all a
question of sparing the hyperesthetic sensibilities of some
idle woman rather than the duller sensibilities of some lower
animal? One by one the infectious diseases that attack man
are being brought under control. There still remain those
incurable diseases such as cancer, those conditions such as
Bright's disease, high blood pressure, heart disease and dia
betes, which may be alleviated but have not been completely
conquered. Shall the methods that have brought success in

misguided and unreasoning followers of this cult opposed to
human progress?
The warfare between man and disease is a never-ending
conflict. The triumphs of hygiene and sanitation in the past
have permitted the building of great cities and the turning
of man's inventive genius from a struggle against the ele
ments and Nature to constructive achievements in industry
and transportation. If the campaign of the sentimentally
minded emotionalist against the use of animals were to suc
ceed with the great legislative bodies of our nation, the
progress of civilization would be inhibited to a far greater
extent than the average man even begins to realize.
THE VALUE OF SERUMS AND VACCINES
Anyone who has seen a child succumbing to the gradual
encroachment of the diphtheria membrane in its throat sud
denly respond to the marvelous effects of diphtheria anti
toxin will oppose to the utmost any attempt to deprive that
child of the remedy. In preparing antitoxin, the horse is re
quired for the production of the serum, and the guinea pig
for standardization. I have seen the horses used for such
service. Their paths are spread in pleasant places. They toil
not at all, they are kept clean, they frolic in the open air
except when the weather may be inclement. They are well
fed and given the best of attention. I have seen the serum
withdrawn and seen the horse make no more visible sign of
protest than is made by the average man when he sticks his
finger on a pin in the back of his wife's dress. I have seen
guinea pigs by the thousands utilized for this work. If I am
any judge of guinea pig emotions they do not suffer unduly
in the process. I have never seen a guinea pig suffer as much
as a hysterical antivivisectionist suffers at a dog and pony
show or a circus.
Before the discovery of the serum for epidemic meningitis,
from fifty to seventy-five per cent of all who were afflicted
died. When the serum is given the mortality is below twenty-
five per cent of those affected, and this says nothing of the
saving in illness and in permanently disabling after effects.

FADS AND QUACKERY IN HEALING
In the investigation which led to this discovery rabbits,
guinea pigs, horses, and monkeys were employed. In a war,
nations sacrifice the lives of hundreds of thousands of their
finest young men; the people are told that the sacrifice is
made so that women and children may have a safe place in
which to live. Shall the lives of rabbits and guinea pigs be
weighed against the lives of the same children threatened
by far greater dangers than those of war: the dangers of in
fectious disease? Puerperal infection which killed the woman
in childbirth was controlled through animal experimenta
tion. What about saving women from that menace?
THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF DRUGS
It is not alone the so-called biological remedies such as
antitoxins, vaccines, and serums that are dependent on ani
mal experimentation. Most of the potent drug remedies
used today for the alleviation and cure of disease must be
tested and standardized by the use of animals. Most of our
important synthetic drugs were first evolved only by the use
of animals. The anesthetics such as ether, chloroform, ethyl
ene, and nitrous oxides have the same effects on animals
that they have on man. Was it not right that they should be
tested first on animals? Such drugs as digitalis which makes
the lives of many persons suffering from heart disease en
durable, have to be standardized by animal tests.
Of course, animal experimentation never will be dis
carded. After all, the progress of scientific medicine is a
powerful movement sweeping on and on with ever increas
ing impetus. The "fly on the chariot wheel" cannot halt it;
but there is danger that the swarm of flies may impede its
movement.
ANIMAL EXPERIMENTATION BENEFITS ANIMALS
Strangely enough, the lower animals have benefited as
much as has man himself through the progress made by ani
mal experimentation. Hog cholera serum, the tuberculin test
for cattle, the control of hoof and mouth disease, puerperal
sepsis in cattle, hydrophobia, fowl plague, and the many

worm diseases that afflict animals depend for their control
on the same type of experimentation that yielded results for
the diseases of man.
There is another side of the question that has its humor
ous aspects. It is necessary to kill hundreds of thousands of
stray dogs and cats in our large cities to keep them from over
running the human inhabitants. It has been estimated that
a single pair of rats, if permitted to breed unchecked might
produce within three years a number of progeny running
into eighteen or twenty-four figures. Everyone knows about
the prolificity of guinea pigs and rabbits which multiply in
ordinately. Who shall say that the uses of science are not as
kind a fate, as satisfactory an existence, as is the hunting
down of the surplus by the hunter, the trapper, the poisoner,
or the poundmaster? As we have shown, the horse used for
the production of serum has a far happier life than the
drawer of burdens in the ownership of some unthinking
careless human being.
THE HISTORY OF ANTIVIVISECTION
It is hard for a person with a logical mind to see why
this argument should be necessary. The average sensible
American business man or farmer is likely to feel that we
are agitating a cause in which the side of reason is so obvious
that its elucidation is wasted effort. But there is a reason!
Scientific experimentation on animals began to attract pub
lic notice about 1875, when the accomplishments of research
into the normal functions of the human body had already
yielded notable results. In Great Britain agitation resulted
in the appointment of a Royal Commission which made an
investigation and recommended that the work be continued
under suitable control.
Since that date efforts have been made by little groups of
illogical thinkers to secure legislation both in Great Britain
and in almost every state in our own country to inhibit or to
prevent completely experiments involving the use of ani
mals. In 1896 a great crowd of ladies and lawyers appeared
before the Committee of the Massachusetts Legislature.

Pamphlets were issued, leaflets were circulated, speakers vo
ciferated abusively, mendaciously, and piteously year after
year. Worst of all, a few shortsighted possessors of great
wealth, animated by no one knows what reasons, left funds
in perpetuity for the uses of promotion of such organiza
tions. Where there are funds, there are jobs for secretaries
whose duty it is to promote regardless of the advances of
progress. Year by year the same little lobbies pop up before
the legislators. The same windy breed of legislators —the
sob sisters of the legislative halls—produce the same bills
and defend them with floods of crocodile tears. The same
cohorts of university presidents, professors, physicians, and
representatives of industries vitally affected must be mobi
lized to present the facts in order to overcome this deluge of
misguided sentiment. Year after year each legislator receives
in his mail, if he is an American, a periodical called Our
Dumb Animals, and if he is a Britisher, one called The
Abolitionist. And the rationally minded sober citizen looks
on aghast and murmurs, "How long, O Lord, how long!"
The antivivisectionist is likely to attack the scientist who
uses animals in his experiments on the ground that the lat
ter is obsessed by sadistic impulses and that he takes a pecu
liar physical and psychologic delight in cruelty to animals.
Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. There
have always been lovers of animals among scientists; indeed,
many have devoted much of their time to the protection of
the interests of animals. There are, moreover, among them
men and women whose whole lives are devoted to the protec
tion of the weak and of the unfortunate. Among the terms
used by the antivivisectionist are such words as "master
demon," "archfiend," "human monster," "human devil,"
"devil incarnate," and "fiend incarnate." Moreover, the
places of research have been called "scientific hells,"
"temples of torment," and "halls of agony," and the work
characterized as "scientific assassination," "torture of the in

gation into the scientific aspects of this subject. Indeed, it is
more reasonable to say that the character of the antivivisec-
tionist is intemperate and biased, and that his propaganda
leads him into frenzy, than it is to believe that the scientist,
who works with a logical series of experiments that will lead
to the cure of human disease, does so animated by fanatic or
orgiastic motives.
OLD DOCTOR HADWEN
One finds among the propagandists against animal experi
mentation the type of character that partakes of the ecstasy
and the almost evangelistic enthusiasm that one sees in the
leaders of cults of any type. In 1924, one Doctor Hadwen of
England toured the United States for the promotion of the
interests of this peculiar group. His lectures overflowed with
unbridled exaggeration; he used all of the oratorical tricks
and showmanship that evangelists have made familiar to us.
On returning to England, however, he was called to treat a
child dying of diphtheria and with the characteristic blind
cruelty of the antivivisectionist, he overlooked all of the ex
perimental evidence that establishes the diphtheria bacillus
as the cause of this disease, and all of the evidences that prove
that diphtheria antitoxin will cure it. The child was per
mitted to die under the gentle ministrations of this mis
guided enthusiast. True, Hadwen was acquitted by the Brit
ish court, because those who are licensed to practice medi
cine are permitted by the law to use such knowledge as they
possess and such individual methods as their peculiar school
of teaching may cause them to believe are satisfactory. The
burden is thus put upon the layman in the selection of his
physician, and the parent who called Doctor Hadwen had no
recourse. When delusions persist to such lengths, is it not
time that an intelligent government concern itself seriously
with the matter?

to animal experimentation have stimulated new activity by
those whose occupations demand that they urge this cause on
legislators and on the public. The sudden awakening of
these agitators after a long period of comparative quiet is,
no doubt, due to the fuel added to their resources by these
new bequests. A human being, about to pass into the Be
yond, is an easy subject to sentimental appeals by fanatical
and unreasoning opponents of scientific medicine.
Not long ago, Mr. H. L. Mencken wrote an expose of the
life and work of the executive secretaries employed by these
bodies—sometimes themselves the originators and directors
of organizations which seem to be established principally to
give the executive secretary a job. In a hearing recently held
before the United States Senate Committee charged with
legislation on this subject, evidence was brought forth in
dicating that one of the organizations now opposing animal
experimentation is definitely of this character.
An indication of the way in which these antisocial propa
gandists attempt to discredit scientific medicine is a ques
tionnaire circulated to the physicians of this country by a
so-called National Antivivisection Society. The questions in
this inquiry were so phrased as to permit easy misuse of the
answers by the group issuing the questionnaire. The very
premises on which the whole argument was based were such
that mere acquiescence to the premises committed a physi
cian to opposition to animal experimentation. Moreover,
physicians were asked to guarantee that all biologic methods,
such as the use of diphtheria toxin-antitoxin and toxoid, and
the use of vaccination against smallpox and other diseases
would be absolutely free from harm in every case. Because
of the physiology of the human being and because of his
body chemistry, and because no two human beings are ex
actly alike in their constitution and in their structure, it is
impossible to guarantee anything in relation to the human
body. It is possible to show that more than a million chil
dren have been given toxin-antitoxin in New York City
without a single harmful result. It is possible to show that
many millions of persons have been vaccinated against small

pox with vast benefit to the control of this disease, and with
rare instances of harm through secondary infection. It is
possible to prove absolutely that the world has been made
safer and more healthful not only for human beings but also
for the animals themselves through the use of animal ex
perimentation. However, the antivivisectionist does not care
for such evidence. He seeks only the rare accident that will
make it possible for him to interfere with the progress of
science and to extract still more shekels from the sentimen
tally minded patrons who support him.
Students of the propaganda put forth by the antivivisec-
tionists, the antivaccinationists, and all those who oppose
modern science are able to produce incident after incident
in which scientific literature has been misquoted, partially
quoted or misinterpreted to promote the antis' cause. It is
the pride of the medical profession that it invariably cleans
its own house. It is the pride of science that it publishes facts
in order that investigators and practitioners may have accu
rate judgment as to the value of any procedure. It is the
habit of propagandists for antiscientific organizations, how
ever, to pervert statistics, to eliminate statements unfavor
able to their cause, and even to misquote when that seems
desirable for the ends they seek.
For more than a quarter of a century, leading educators
and statesmen have recognized the value of animal experi
mentation for the good of all living beings and have de
spaired because so many human beings seem to be swayed
by false propaganda. Year after year, physicians, chemists,
biologists, sociologists, economists, and statesmen have had
to give freely of their time and their funds in order to meet
the attacks of these propagandists before legislative bodies.
If the sums necessary for this defense of science could have
been applied still further to the saving of life, who knows
what vast good might not have been accomplished.

mentation that will make it as nearly perfect as possible in
preventing unnecessary pain and in providing animals with
the best of care. A committee of the American Medical As
sociation regularly functions for no other purpose. Under
the control of this committee each laboratory binds itself
to observe the rules laid down and to post those rules regu
larly in each department. The rules require the animals
be held at least as long as they are held at the city pound;
that they receive every consideration for their bodily com
fort; that no operations be made, except with the sanction of
the director of the laboratory; that animals be anesthetized
and rendered incapable of receiving pain in all operations,
except in those in which anesthesia would defeat the object
of the experiment, and finally that animals be killed pain
lessly at the conclusion of the experiment. These rules are
most rigidly enforced and laboratories throughout the coun
try are open to inspection by anyone interested from a scien
tific point of view, or from the point of view of control of
this work.
If it be true, as has been said again and again, that science
is the hope of the future for the progress of humanity, those
who obstruct this progress by needless and unwarranted fol
lies should be considered as subjects for mental investiga
tion, or else as misguided sentimentalists whom one con

FADS IN HEALTH LEGISLATION
"The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience. The
felt necessities of the time; the prevalent moral and political theories;
institutions of public policy, even the prejudices which judges share
with their fellow men, have had a good deal more to do than the
syllogism in determining the rule by which men should be gov
erned." —Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes: "The Common Law."
"It is absurd that the administration of a modern State should be left
to men ignorant of science and of its human consequences."
—Frederick Soddy: "Science and Life."
Not
long ago a group of physicians was returning from a
medical convention. They were seated in the smoking
compartment of the Pullman, discussing the newest restric
tions which a beneficent democracy had decided to place on
the practice of medicine, and time passed so rapidly that
they failed to take notice of the fact that they were rapidly
nearing their destination. The porter, whose vision of fifty-
cent tips was fading, finally mustered up the courage to
make a direct attack. He tapped one of the gossiping medi
cos on the shoulder and inquired: "Brush you off, sah?"
"No, indeed," said the doctor, unwilling to be disturbed,
"I don't want to fill all this air with bacteria."
"Don't be afraid, sah," said the porter, "the brushin' that
I do ain' gwine disturb no bacteria none."
In 1920 the Board of Health of Florida established the
following regulation, among others, for the conduct of com
mon carriers:
The brushing of passengers' clothing in the body of the
car in transit is prohibited.

Between the porter's skepticism and the fears of the au
thor of that ordinance what a wide range of opinion! But
how much of our health legislation is actually as ineffective
as the porter's brush? In no field of human activity do the
laws present such a bewildering maze of fact and fallacy, of
the unenforcable and the unobeyable, as in that of public
health. In many instances they seem to represent the transi
ent enthusiasms of the day translated into the rigid legisla
tion of a generation; in other cases, they ramble limpingly
along miles behind the science with whose progress they
pretend to keep pace.
Far back in the last century an epidemic of cholera broke
upon the world, and with no knowledge of bacteriology the
authorities of the time were confronted with a demand for
protection by a panic-stricken public. On August 16, 1832,
the Board of Health of Washington issued the following
pronunciamento :
The Board of Health, after mature deliberations, have
Resolved, and they do now declare, that the following
articles are, in their opinion, highly prejudicial to health
at the present season. Believing them, therefore, in the light
of nuisances, they hereby direct that the sale of them, or
their introduction within the limits of this city, be prohib
ited from and after the 22nd instant, for the space of ninety
days:
Cabbage, green corn, cucumbers, peas, beans, parsnips,
carrots, egg plants, cimblings or squashes, pumpkins, tur
nips, watermelons, cantaloupes, muskmelons, apples, pears,
peaches, plums, damsons, cherries, apricots, pineapples,
oranges, lemons, limes, cocoanuts, ice-creams, fish, crabs,
oysters, clams, lobsters, and crawfish.
The following articles the Board have not considered it
necessary to prohibit the sale of, but even these they would
admonish the community to be moderate in using:
Potatoes, beets, tomatoes and onions.
Having thus cut off entirely the supply of fresh vege
tables, with the exception of four on which they cast dis

ances or other exhibitions which might be calculated to
bring together large collections of persons be suspended for
ninety days, and then followed with a still more remarkable
resolution:
Resolved, That it is the opinion of the Board of Health
of this city that quarantine regulations interdicting the com
mercial intercourse of our country are wholly ineffectual in
preventing the introduction and spread of Asiatic cholera,
as well as vexatious and embarrassing to the community, and
that they are injurious by creating a false confidence in such
provisions, to the neglect of the more important preserva
tives from the disease. The Board, therefore, earnestly desires
that the city authorities will not enact any prohibitory regu
lations upon this subject.
So early entered the commercial considerations with which
health regulations are still so frequently at war! In this day,
when we know that cholera is caused by a definite bacterial
organism, first described by Robert Koch in 1883; when we
know that it is spread like typhoid, through contact with a
patient, or through contamination of milk or water by his
excreta; when we know that it can be and has been kept out
by an adequate system of quarantine, the resolutions of the
Washington Board seem asinine and ridiculous. Our knowl
edge of infectious disease has developed more in the past
forty years than in all the previous centuries. Our sanitary
authorities no longer work in the dark; they are able to
recommend safe and sound legislation for the control of dis
ease. But only too often, alas, legislators contrive to yield to
expediency, to fanatical enthusiasm, or to the unweighed
superficial evidence of the hour. The results are always ludi
crous and sometimes they are disastrous.

random, choosing those which demonstrate how little the
legislative mind has changed during a century.
In 1916, the State of Colorado passed a measure regard
ing the hygienic arrangements of places in which food is
prepared, manufactured, or distributed. Among other clauses
appeared the following:
Cuspidors for the use of operatives, employees, clerks, or
other persons shall be provided whenever necessary, and
each cuspidor shall be thoroughly emptied and washed out
daily with a disinfectant solution.
Thus, Colorado, the mecca of the tuberculous, instead of
attempting to educate its public to the menace of expectorat
ing where food is lying about, promotes the habit by supply
ing facilities for it! What, indeed, is the presence of the
spittoon but a psychological encouragement to spitting?
That gaudy institution, the American barbershop, in
which Babbitt receives elegantly the simultaneous ministra
tions of barber, manicurist, and bootblack, is naturally sub
ject to numerous abuses from the health point of view.
Dermatologists have conferred the name of barber's itch
on a form of infection often acquired there, and no doubt
many a seeker of cosmetic embellishment has fetched away
other and even worse blessings. These facts have become
known, it appears, to legislators, and the result is a weird
assemblage of regulations governing tonsorial activities, most
of them utterly inadequate to prevent the dangers at which
they are aimed, and all quite unenforceable without tre
mendous staffs of special barbershop hounds. Consider the
following from the Colorado code:
Soaps, bay rums, face lotions, hair tonics, and other toilet
articles and all solutions must be pure and unadulterated.
Let anyone explain what that means —and if it means
what he probably thinks it means, how is it to be enforced?
The State of Colorado also believes that its barbers should
be physically above reproach. It therefore disregards a half

dozen obvious facts that make the enforcement of the law
impossible and salves its conscience with the following:
Any barber who is affected with open tuberculosis, vene
real or other communicable disease must not practice the
barber trade. Habitual drunkenness or the use of intoxi
cating liquor during business hours is strictly forbidden.
Strange that Colorado should thus by insinuation attack
the sobriety of one of the most erudite professions practiced
in our midst!
Alabama answers the roll call with a sanitary regulation
concerning soda fountains:
No patron or customer shall be supplied with a spoon for
consumption of a drink or a confection except it has been
sterilized since last used, or has never been used.
Sterilization requires equipment which the soda fountains
of Alabama certainly do not provide. Where, indeed, is the
evidence that disease is carried by spoons that have been
washed in running water? And how is the spoon, once steril
ized, to reach the customer in a still sterile condition? More
over, who knows how many bacteria may reside on a spoon
that has never been used?
Arizona provides a law regulating midwives with this
provision:
A midwife must endeavor to secure the assistance of a phy
sician if the child is not born after twenty-four hours of
labor.
It would be interesting to know what scientific opinion
aided the lawmakers in determining that twenty-four hours
should be the limit of difficulty. Why not twelve or eight
een? And if twenty-four is safe, why not thirty-six?

ceptacle in which he has conveniently concealed it. It also
requires the cleaning of telephone earpieces and mouth
pieces with soap and water at least once a week, although
there is not the slightest scientific evidence that disease has
ever been transmitted by these appliances; indeed, experi
ments recently conducted under government supervision in
England show that the likelihood of infection from such
sources is infinitesimally small.
Following the last great epidemic of influenza Illinois and
many other States adopted elaborate laws for the control of
that disease. The Illinois regulations involve notification,
placarding, quarantine, and terminal disinfection. On No
vember 3, 1918, the State of Washington issued a regulation
requiring every person to wear a gauze mask of a specified
character when in public during the duration of an epidemic
of influenza, and other States have laws requiring the use
of gauze masks by those in contact with a patient. All of
these regulations are subject to criticism on the ground
that the manner of spreading the disease is not definitely
known and that there is no sharp dividing line between what
is commonly called a severe cold during nonepidemic pe
riods and what is called a light attack of influenza during
epidemic periods. It is known that the infecting substance
of epidemic influenza is carried in the nose and throat, and
so precautions should be observed during epidemics by those
in contact with infected persons, but any regulation requir
ing notification and placarding for influenza during nonepi
demic periods is quite unwarranted in theory, and is cer
tainly never observed in practice.
Next to the common carrier the hotel and the restaurant

North Dakota has a hotel inspection act that covers care
fully almost every imaginable sanitary contingency. Many
years ago an elongated Texan entered a Texas hostelry and

ered his feet his neck was unprotected. The result of his
harrowing experience was the famous, and perhaps legen
dary, Texas bed sheet law which ordained that every hotel
must provide sheets long enough to tuck under the mattress
at either end. But North Dakota's law is not directed so
much to the matter of comfort as to that of hygiene. It
provides that hotels charging fifty cents a night or more
shall always change sheets and pillow slips after a guest
departs. Obviously, the guest who pays less than fifty cents
a night is likely to be less cleanly and to leave more for
the next occupant than is the one who is able to pay more,
but no doubt economy as well as hygiene swayed the legis

From the point of view of vital statistics no law is so im
portant as that requiring the registration of births. The
United States has been particularly backward in this respect
and there are many States not yet in the registration area.
Moreover, both physicians and the public are frequently lax
in carrying out the duties imposed upon them by law. Fur
thermore, while legislators are quite willing to pass all sorts
of statutes for the benefit of the public health they usually
hesitate to provide the necessary funds for administering
the acts that are passed. The result is sometimes ludicrous.
But it is a question if folly in this department has ever at
tained elsewhere the heights revealed in a circular issued by
the State Registrar of Virginia on March 20, 1921. I quote
in part:
Senate Bill No. 210, to preserve racial integrity, passed the
House March 8, 1924, and is now a law of this State.
This bill aims at correcting a condition which only the
more thoughtful people of Virginia know the experience of.
It is estimated that there are in the State from 10,000 to
20,000, possibly more, near-white people, who are known to
possess an intermixture of colored blood, in some cases to a
slight extent, it is true, but still enough to prevent them
from being white.

In the past it has been possible for these people to declare
themselves white or even to have the Court so declare them.
Then they have demanded the admittance of their children
into the white schools, and in not a few cases have inter
married with white people.
In many counties they exist as distinct colonies holding
themselves aloof from Negroes, but not being admitted by
the white people as of their race.
In any large gathering or school of colored people, espe
cially in the cities, many will be observed who are scarcely
distinguishable as colored.
These persons, however, are not white in reality, nor by
the new definition of this law, that a white person is one
with no trace of the blood of another race, except that a
person with one-sixteenth of the American Indian, if there
is no other race mixture, may be classed as white.
Their children are likely to revert to the distinctly Negro
type even when all apparent evidence of mixture has dis
appeared
Our Bureau has kept a watchful eye upon the situation,
and has guarded the welfare of the State as far as possible
with inadequate law and power. The condition has gone on,
however, and is rapidly increasing in importance.
Unless radical measures are used to prevent
it,
Virginia
and other parts
of
the nation must surely in time go the way
of
all other countries in which people
of
two or more races
have lived in close contact. With the exception
of
the
Hebrew race, complete intermixture or amalgamation has
been the inevitable result.
To succeed, the intermarriage
of
the white race with
mixed stock must be made impossible. But that
is
not suf
ficient. Public sentiment must be so aroused that intermix
ture out
of
wedlock will cease.
The public must be led to look with scorn and contempt
upon the man who will degrade himself, and do harm to
society,
by
such abhorrent deeds.
The registrar obviously recognizes the frequency in the
South of amourettes between white men and Negro girls
and apparently plans to prevent more of them by arousing
public opinion. He recognizes also that at least 20,000 per

such ostensibly white persons may be a somewhat dusky
progeny. What he does not know, and what no one else
knows for that matter, is any certain method of determin
ing when Negro blood is present in a person, or how to
determine just when the prospective infant of such a person
will show it. Nevertheless, he is bold in attacking the prob
lem, perhaps because his solution offers a means of provid
ing funds for extending the work of his department. Here
is his solution:
The task of the Bureau of Vital Statistics is a great one,
with not a cent of appropriation to accomplish it with.
There is a plan, however, by which it may be financed if
the public will lend its aid.
Thousands have applied for the registration of births that
occurred before June 14, 1921, the date when the old law
went into effect.
The new law further provides for the registration of all
persons who desire
it,
and who will make application for
such registration
of
color and birth, remitting at the same
time the fee
of
twenty-five cents for each applicant. Do not
send stamps. The births will be permanently recorded and
preserved for all time and will be
of
great value for many
purposes, such as to prove American citizenship when apply
ing for passports to go abroad, and for establishing and pre
serving the family tree for future generations.
We will even admit for registration persons living in Vir
ginia but born elsewhere.
A
family may complete its family
tree
by
recording deceased ancestors or relatives. Each per
son will thus obtain full value received for the small fee.
Virginians now living elsewhere may also register.
If
ten or twenty thousand or more will register within the
next few weeks, we will be able to provide printed forms,
filing cases, desks, typewriters, postage and clerk hire, to
begin
a
vigorous State-wide educational propaganda.
As has been said, there
is
no known method by which the
admixture of Negro blood with white in the human being
may be certainly detected. It thus becomes possible for any

came to a formal test, science would be quite unable to aid
him in detecting the presence of a Negro strain that was
not obvious to the naked eye.
REGULATING THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE
With our forty-eight States and the District of Columbia
we have an equal number of laws regulating the practice
of medicine. They are practically without uniformity, and
in many states there are four or five discordant laws cover
ing the various new cults. Following is an excerpt from an
act passed by the legislature of Connecticut —a State famous
for lately licensing almost a hundred men with stolen, pur
chased, or otherwise misgotten medical diplomas. This law
is entitled "An Act Concerning the Practice of Natureop-
athy":
For the purpose of this act, the practice of natureopathy
shall be held to mean the practice of the psychological,
mechanical and material sciences, as follows: The psycho
logical sciences such as psychotherapy; the mechanical sci
ences, such as mechanotherapy, articular manipulation, mas
sage, corrective and orthopedic gymnastics, neurotherapy,
physiotherapy, hydrotherapy, electrotherapy, thermotherapy,
phototherapy, chromotherapy, vibriotherapy, concussion,
pneumatotherapy and zonotherapy; and the material sciences,
such as dietetics, histolotherapy and external applications;
but shall not be held to mean internal medication.
Here is legal power inflicting on the people of the State
all the fantastic forms of assault upon the exterior of the
ailing human that have been devised by the paranoiac brains
of a hundred cultist prophets! By the act the State gives
legal recognition to the disciples of the late—but not too
late—Albert Abrams, who was responsible for vibration

spectrochrome-therapy; of George Starr White and his bio-
dynamo-chromatictherapy of Still, the osteopath; Palmer,
the chiropractor, and heaven knows how many more gro
tesque evangelists.
Connecticut thus provides amiably for all the cultists;
most other States, perhaps a little more wary, provide only
for the groups with effective lobbies.
In 1931, attempts were made in Arizona to create a naprap-
athy board, in Pennsylvania to create a special board con
sisting of naturopaths, chiropractors, and neuropaths to
regulate drugless healing, and in nine other states bills were
killed introduced in favor of naturopathy. Utah, however,
marred an otherwise perfect record by passing a bill which
provided that practitioners of naturopathy might be exam
ined by a committee of naturopaths exclusively instead of
by a committee which included physicians. The bills regard
ing naturopathy in other states are just about as complicated
and peculiar as the one which controls the practitioners of
this remarkable cult in Connecticut. In practically all states
the naturopathic bills propose to authorize the licentiates to
use the title "doctor" with their names provided the word
naturopath follows the name of the healer. In several states
where there are basic science laws, attempts have been made
to exempt naturopaths. Wyoming in 1931, exempted from
its Medical Practice Act all persons who treat human ail
ments by prayer or spiritual means, and in California—good
old California—it was proposed to create a Board of Chris
tian Healing and to regulate the practice of treatment by
Christian healing and imposition of hands or annointment
with oil, and prayer. There were no educational qualifica

of neuropathy, and in Washington in favor of sanipractic,
and in Iowa in favor of suggestive therapeutics.
The record for 1931 is typical of the year by year battles
in various States fought by the medical profession in behalf
of the people to prevent the licensing of ignorant healers
to practice their performances on the human body. Iowa,
birthplace of chiropractic, permits osteopaths to use the pre
fix "doctor" if followed by the letters D. O., and chiroprac
tors to use the prefix if followed by the letters D. C. Even
optometrists can call themselves "doctors" if they put Opt.
after their names. In America doctors of this kind are almost
as profuse as professors.
Quite frequently State legislatures endeavor to regulate
the practice of surgery. Wisconsin once tried to cause every
doctor to submit removed appendixes to the State Legisla
ture and in Massachusetts in 1931, a bill was introduced to
require the consent of a patient before a physician removed
any organ of the body and to require the physician to ex
plain to the patient before the operation the necessity for
such removal. Moreover, the bill proposed to cause physi
cians who anticipated some pain from their handling of the
patient to explain to the patient first that pain would result
and to obtain the patient's permission. Good old American
legislators never hesitate to practice law, medicine, dentistry,
or any other learned profession or science. A constant battle
wages between the medical profession and the Congress of
the United States because that Congress invariably embarks
on regulation of medical practice. Recent efforts of legisla
tors to break into medical science have resulted in some ex
traordinary demonstrations. In Mississippi in 1930, a law
was enacted providing that no marriage license shall be is
sued when it appears that the applicants, or either of them,
is drunk, insane or an imbecile. It is quite a task for a mar
riage clerk to determine whether or not any couple antici
pating marriage is imbecilic. The New York State Legisla
ture in 1930 passed a bill to license persons, firms, or cor
porations engaged in procuring people to donate blood.

FADS IN HEALTH LEGISLATION
CONTROLLING DISEASE BY LAW
The control of venereal disease is the despair of public
health officers and legislators alike. The statute books of all
the States bulge with measures that are hopelessly inefficient
to accomplish what they purport to do. Many States and
municipalities have laws requiring the reporting of cases of
venereal disease by both name and address, by address alone,
or with neither name nor address. None of these methods
yields anything resembling an adequate index of the true
venereal disease rate of the community. Some States also
require druggists to record the names of those purchasing
remedies believed to be for the treatment of venereal dis
ease, but I have seen nowhere any evidence that such laws
are obeyed or that they have accomplished anything. Else
where, arrangements are made to quarantine and treat those
suffering with venereal disease, particularly the prostitute
who is the widest disseminator of these diseases; the first few
hours after her release see her again at work, promptly in
fected again, if not still infectious, and as promptly infect
ing those who come in contact with her. The truth is that
physicians who have watched the progress of venereal disease
legislation over many years have become more and more con
vinced that their eradication is an educational and medical
problem, not a legislative one. Eradication will depend on
education in prophylaxis and on prompt and successful treat
ment. Certainly the burden of proof is on the legislators and
their advisers that their restrictive and regulatory measures
have accomplished anything. The only value of much of the
legislation so far enacted lies in its dissemination of educa
tional matter.
All in all, the study of legislation in the field of health and
hygiene leads to a simple conclusion, and it is that of Mr.
Justice Holmes: "The life of the law has not been logic"
and "the prevalent moral and political theories . . . have
had a good deal more to do than the syllogism in determin
ing the rule by which men should be governed." Nebraska,
Wisconsin, and many other States have laws which forbid

physicians to split fees, and a strong organization of sur
geons in this country requires each of its members to take
an oath that he will not do so. But only an elementary
knowledge of human nature is required to make it plain
that the man who wants to split fees will not hesitate to
violate a law that is easier to flout than the Volstead Act,
or to break an oath of the nature of that required by the
surgical organization. How many men, indeed, have ever
been penalized for violating that law, and how many have
been dropped from the surgical organization for forgetting
their oath?
PROTECTION OF MATERNITY AND INFANCY
A typical disregard of logic by legislators appeared in the
passage of the Sheppard-Towner Act providing for the "pub
lic protection of maternity and infancy." This act was one
of those, rather numerous during the Harding administra
tion, which arranged to give a certain amount of money to
the individual State out of the national treasury, provided
the State would appropriate an equal amount. As might
have been expected, the law was heartily endorsed by the
conference of State and territorial health officers, which
meets annually in Washington. Similar measures were in
troduced for the development of physical training, for im
provements in education, for the treatment of venereal dis
eases, and for other projects. As soon as any such federal
law is passed the proponents of it mobilize at the State
legislatures and use it as an inducement to get large State
appropriations.
The American Medical Association through The Journal,
and many other important medical organizations opposed
the passage of the Sheppard-Towner Act. It was urged that
the care of the mother and the child is a local—even a per
sonal —not a Federal function. It was pointed out that the
encroachment of the State upon the personal relations be
tween the patient and his physician was becoming a menace.
Compulsory health insurance and State medicine, indeed,
are the ultimate and worst forms of paternalism; they hinder

medical progress by inhibiting individual initiative. Let me
quote from Dr. Frank Billings, a leader of American medi
cine, on this point:
There may be rational grounds for this policy in sparsely
populated regions of the country which are not provided
with a sufficient number of resident physicians to care prop
erly for the sick. With this exception there is no rational
basis for this sort of paternalism on the part of the Federal
or State government. State medicine is naturally and prop
erly concerned in the matter of public health: air, and water
pollution, food contamination and adulteration, the preven
tion of the spread of communicable diseases, and the like.
The State properly may standardize and enforce certain rules
of procedure —notification, methods of disinfection, and the
like—for the medical practitioner in the management of
patients who suffer from communicable diseases; but the
treatment must be left with the physician. . . . Experience
shows that centralized administration, either federal or State,
of activities dealing with the health or with the treatment of
the sick and injured is likely to become bureaucratic and
occasionally is subject to political debasement.
It is significant that President Coolidge put himself defi
nitely on record as opposed in principle to all laws which in
volve Federal subsidies to individual States. But the reader
who will look up the platforms of both the major political
parties during 1920 will find planks in each of them prom
ising definitely to provide maternity-infancy legislation.
These planks were inserted by experienced platform builders
to attract the growing women's vote. The legislation prom
ised was enacted, all but six States made the individual ap
propriations required —and yet the maternal death rate has
not been appreciably affected.
However, the greatest interest attaches in recent years to
legislation which is concerned with Federal subsidies by the
government to the States in order to aid prenatal care and
maternal welfare and in attempts by the government to en
ter on the practice of medicine through the provision of
complete medical care to veterans and their families. The

progress of the legislation initiated as the Sheppard-Towner
legislation has been exceedingly interesting. When the bill
was first introduced it provided for operation over a certain
period. At the end of that period, a government bureau
once having been established with a considerable number
of employees, new legislation was agitated to make the ex
periment an indefinite one. Other legislation proposed to
continue the measures for but five years. The new bills
finally were organized into what was known as the Jones-
Cooper Bill. The functioning of the Sheppard-Towner Act
failed to effect any discoverable reduction in maternal and
infant mortality rates. No statistics could be obtained which
indicated that the operation of this measure had in any way
decreased the incidence of deaths of either mothers or babies.
No evidence was produced to show that any of the numer
ous child health conferences appreciably affected the infant
or maternal mortality rates. The original Sheppard-Towner
Act became a law November 23, 1921. At the end of its
service, legislation was passed to continue it for another
brief period. On June 30, 1929, however, the act died. Dur
ing the seven and a half years that it was in effect it cost the
people of this country about eleven millions of dollars. Dur
ing that time it did not apparently develop a single new idea
in the field of maternal and infant hygiene, nor did it ac
celerate the rate of decline in either maternal or infant
death rates. Much of the money devoted to the States through
the Sheppard-Towner Act was spent on health projects in no
way related to the prevention of maternal and infant mor
tality, but projects which seemed to the State health officers
excellent ways in which to spend the Sheppard-Towner
money.
The beginning of 1932 finds new legislation proposed for
the continuance of these appropriations, now known as the
Jones-Bankhead Bill, held incommunicado in a Senate com
mittee. In these days when budgets are difficult to balance
and when there is wailing and anxiety over Federal expendi
tures, Federal subsidies to the States are likely to be seri
ously curtailed. It would seem that the processes of Nature,

as revealed in national economics, have taken care of what
seemed to be an impossible situation from the point of view
of governmental control of health activity within the indi
vidual states.
THE CARE OF THE VETERAN
Following the World War, our government, like all others,
undertook to provide suitably for disability sustained by
veterans as a result of their war service. The record of our
government in the care of its veterans surpasses in lavishness
that of any other nation in the world. At a time when strin
gent economies in expenditure are necessary this fact must
be emphasized. Immediately after the World War, plans
were made to provide hospitalization for every veteran who
might be suffering from a disability incurred during the war,
or a disability that might be remotely related to his war
service. Then in 1924 it was revealed that numerous beds
in government hospitals were unoccupied. Legislation was
introduced to provide also for the hospitalization of veterans
with disabilities not of service origin, with the understand
ing that indigent veterans were to get first choice. The beds
available have multiplied enormously. Even now, however,
plans are proposed for increasing the number still further,
notwithstanding that a survey recently made indicated that
more than 200,000 beds in civilian hospitals are unoccupied
and that many civilian institutions face ruin for this reason.
The mathematics of the situation is simple. There are at
present some fifty-three veterans' hospitals with approxi
mately 26,000 beds. Because of the policy of taking care of
veterans for all disabilities regardless of their service origin,
the Veterans' Bureau estimates that 130,000 beds will be re
quired. The average cost of construction of a hospital is
from $3,000 to $3,400 a bed; the mere cost of construction
will therefore approximate $300,000,000. The cost of main
tenance will be well over $200,000,000 a year, not including
the cost of maintenance of the staff, which would be approxi
mately $20,000,000 a year more. What a prospect for a period
of financial depression! With these institutions once created

and operating, the government is confronted with two alter
natives: It may continue indefinitely to give free medical
care, enlarging the group cared for, thereby keeping beds
occupied and the Veterans' Bureau intact, or it may look
forward ultimately to disbanding the Veterans' Bureau and
to scrapping the million dollar institutions it proposes to
construct.
The psychology of the situation is again simple. A bureau
once established begins to expand, to grow, and to forestall
dissolution. The Veterans' Bureau, if it wishes to continue
as a thriving and growing organization, naturally will sup
port plans for extending its hospital facilities and its per
sonnel.
There are many reasons why the people of the United
States must oppose unreasoning expansion of the Veterans'
Bureau and why they should consider alternative plans such
as that providing cash benefits to disabled veterans. These
reasons are so logical and so inherently sound that they must
appeal to every thinking person. The continued building of
veterans' hospitals and the enlargement of the Veterans'
Bureau constitute an insidious approach to State medicine.
The actual needs of veterans will gradually be exceeded by
the medical provisions available. Then socialistically and
communistically minded demagogues will demand that the
State administer care to all individuals, as it has attempted
to care for veterans. Such a procedure would strike at the
fundamental principles of the democracy under which we
live and for which our veterans fought. It would impair
greatly the progress of medical science; it would destroy in
terest in medicine as a career. It would lead to the poor
type of medical service given to people under similar sys
tems abroad.
The veteran today must go to a veterans' hospital selected
for him by the Veterans' Bureau, even though it is some
distance from his home. Thus he is removed from his fam
ily to become a ward of the state. Government employees,
whose primary allegiance must be to the government which
employs them rather than to the veteran who is served, ex

amine and diagnose his case. Free choice of physician and
responsibility to the patient rather than to any other em
ployer is so fundamental in first-rate medical practice that
it has been recognized even by governments that are ex
perimenting with state medical care. Government bureaus
do not provide for this type of practice.
It has been argued that veterans, permitted to choose
their own physicians, will succumb to quackery. The argu
ment is not warranted by the experience of state insurance
systems that permit free choice of physicians. Our veterans
as a group are certainly as intelligent as the rest of the pub
lic. It is unlikely that they will choose quackery any more
than the rest of the people choose quackery in times of
illness.
American soldiers who fought in Europe and who served
in this country were inspired by the ideal of maintaining
the great American democracy. Our system of government
gives the individual free choice of his method of life; it
gives him a voice in selecting his government and the laws
by which he will be governed. The present plan of hospitali
zation for the disabled and the possible extension of this
hospitalization to the care of all veterans, to the families of
veterans, and, indeed, to other persons in the government
service is a threat at the very foundation of our government.
It will, no doubt, arouse chortles of joy among socialistic
and communistic leaders.
Yes! Mr. Justice Holmes was right: "the institutions of
public policy" have a great deal to do with shaping our laws;
certainly much more than sound logic or the established
facts of science!

THE CULT OF BEAUTY
"Remember that the most beautiful things in the world are the most
useless; Peacocks and lilies, for instance." —Ruskin.
"Beauty provoketb thieves sooner than gold."
—Shakespeare, "As You Like It."
In
the classified telephone directory of any large American
city one comes casually on the heading Barber Colleges,
and proceeds then through Barbers, Baths and Beauty Cul
ture Schools, to Beauty Parlors. Then one advances to Cor
sets and Accessories, to Cosmeticians and to Dermatologists
—and begins to realize at last what a vast trade has grown
out of the desires of Mr. Babbitt and his wife and daughters
to enhance the physiognomies and figures with which a none
too beneficent Providence endowed them. If one resides in
a town in which the trade is backward, the promoters of
comeliness may still be found under such old-fashioned head

heading Plastic Surgery, and comes upon the names of five
or six medicos who, it seems, devote themselves to the re
moval of the redundant wrinkle, to restoring the aquilinity
of misshaped proboscides, to the disposal of the fat resultant
from too many calories, and to the miscellaneous alteration
of countenances which, for one reason or another, seem to
their possessors to be not what they ought to be. These
learned gentry are obviously not to be listed with the ladies
above mentioned, except in so far as they are also concerned
with the glorification of American womanhood and woman
like manhood. Of their arts and their deceits more will be
said later.
Estimates place the number of beauty shops in Manhattan
at between fifteen hundred to two thousand. There are at
least a thousand in Los Angeles, not counting Hollywood.
The number in Florida for a while increased with every
incoming train, for the beauty shop, like the fur store, the
jewelry store, the dance hall, and the homes of "ladies of
leisure," is among the first to profit when money is loose,
profits are large, and the turnover rapid. Of late, the de
pression or predicament has turned many a damsel to beau-
tification at home. Only the permanent wave continues to
flourish. The high potentate of one college for cosmeticians
informs me that nine thousand emporiums are devoted ex
clusively to the sale and application of her wares, and that
an average of ten more or less sightly young women dispense
beauty and its accessories at each of them. The casual trade
in powders, soaps, creams, lotions, beauty masks, nose-
shapers, chin-lifters, ear-pressers, hair-restorers, hair-re
movers, hair-straighteners, and hair-tonics is a matter of
millions.
Indeed, it is largely on their sale—they are endowed with
names as fanciful as those of the ladies who promote them
—that the beauty shop industry has arisen. All the rest of
the hocus-pocus —the "colleges" for the training of appren
tices, the various mysterious technics and maneuvers, and
the trade associations and their carefully planned publicity
—are intended mainly to promote the traffic in toilet prepa

rations. If one turns from that section in the telephone book
devoted to beauty parlors and hairdressers to that headed
Cosmetics or Toilet Preparations, certain names will be
found recurring with the significant words "manufacturing
company" behind them. The company with the nine thou
sand dispensatories of cosmetic art manufactures one hun
dred and thirty-seven preparations. Corresponding to the
Beau Ideal Shop we have the Beau Ideal Preparations, to
the Boncilla Shops the Boncilla Laboratories, Inc., to the
Cara Mia Shops the Cara Mia, Inc., to the Charm of Youth
Shops the Charm of Youth Corporation, to the Marinello
Shops the Marinello Company. There are Helena Rubin
stein and Elizabeth Arden also. And so on through the list,
with the independent ladies who conduct individual shops
or parlors, perhaps in their own homes, supplied by manu
facturers who deal in the various preparations in bulk. The
business increases by leaps and bounds, and is acquiring a
legal status. Let us cease for a moment these generalizations
and gaze upon some concrete facts.
THE LAW AND THE BEAUTY SHOP
Many of our States are already in the fold with State
licenses for beauticians, and the way is open in most of the
others.
In Illinois one cannot practice beauty culture without a
certificate of registration as a beauty culturist. "Any one or
any combination of the following practices constitutes the
practice of beauty culture when done for cosmetic or beau
tifying purposes and not for the treatment of disease or of
muscular or nervous disorder," says the law. Here, indeed,
is a fine distinction, and the specifications go on to convey
suggestions titillating to an active imagination. Beauty cul
ture, according to the act, is "the application of cosmetic
preparations to the human body by massaging, stroking,
kneading, slapping, tapping, stimulating, manipulating, ex
ercising, cleansing, beautifying, or by means of devices, ap
paratus or appliances, arranging, dressing, marcelling, curl
ing, waving, cleansing, singeing, bleaching, coloring, dyeing,

tinting, or otherwise treating by any means the hair of any
person." I have seen a photograph of the governor of this
proud State as he signed the law, his cranium, quite devoid
of hirsutage, glowing beneath the countenance of an in
spired cosmetician, who breathlessly awaits the application
to the paper of the tintorial fluid that is to legalize her noble
profession. But wait! Another great profession also pleads
for protection! "However," says the act, "provisions of this
act shall not authorize any registered beauty culturist to cut
or clip the hair of any person unless he has first obtained a
certificate of registration as a barber."
The law specifies who may be a registered apprentice in
the art and limits the certificate of cosmetician to those who
are at least sixteen years of age, of good moral character and
temperate habits, and who have graduated from an eighth-
grade elementary school or completed an equivalent course,
and finally, who have either studied beauty culture for one
year as registered apprentices or graduated from an ap
proved school. Naturally, the legislators provided for admit
ting into the fold, pronto and without examination, all those
who were practicing one year before the law was passed. Also
they provided for the revocation of licenses for immorality,
habitual drunkenness, gross malpractice, incompetency, con
tinued practice by persons having contagious diseases, drug
addiction, and unprofessional conduct.
The Arkansas bill specifically mentions the removal of
superfluous hair as a part of the cosmetic therapist's art. The
Missouri law speaks of hairdressers, cosmeticians, or cos
metologists as well as of beauty culturists. It also employs
the words "cosmetology" and "cosmetological establish
ment." In its definition of the practices concerned, it men
tions particularly the removal of superfluous hair by elec
tricity and speaks of the "limited practice of cosmetology" as
the "occupation of manicurists and electrologists." The Mis
souri law requires the registration of each cosmetological
establishment for purposes of sanitary control and bars the
use of its rooms at any time for sleeping or residential pur
poses. It carefully exempts from the law members of the fol

lowing liberal professions: medicine, surgery, dentistry, os
teopathy, chiropody and barbering.
In Oregon the law takes another turn; there cosmetic
therapy includes "the application of the hands or of me
chanical or electric apparatus with or without cosmetic
preparations, tonics, lotions, creams or clays, to massage,
cleanse, stimulate, manipulate, exercise or otherwise improve
or beautify the scalp, face, neck, shoulders, arms or upper
part of the body, removing superfluous hair, manicuring the
nails of any person, male or female, and to arrange, dress,
curl, wave, cleanse, cut, singe, bleach, color or similarly
treat the hair of any female." Here also the new profession
has not been permitted to infringe upon the immemorial
rights of the barber.
Wisconsin found necessity for definitions of the terms
bobbing, beauty parlor, managing cosmetician, operator,
itinerant cosmetician, and school of cosmetic art. It carefully
exempts chiropodists, masseurs, hospital attendants, nurses
and student nurses, physicians, surgeons, and barbers from
the operations of the act. It places all cosmetic establish
ments under the State board of health for examination and
inspection. It regulates particularly the use of the electric
needle. There must be no treatment of diseases of the skin
or scalp except under the direct supervision of a physician.
Towels may be used only once and instruments must be
sterilized after each employment.
In some of the States the licensing of cosmetic practi
tioners is controlled by a State board of registration, in some
by the board of health, and in some by specially established
boards. In New Mexico the board has five members, of
whom at least two must be women beauty culturists and two
male hairdressers. Nothing is said about the qualifications of
the fifth member. Utah mentions specifically as included in
the practice of the cosmetician the removing of superfluous
hair, warts, or moles by the use of electricity or otherwise.
To those familiar with legislative methods in America it
will be clear at once that the passage of such legislation in so
many States within a period of little more than a year repre

sents an organized movement, with the submission of a so-
called model bill, modified to meet the idiosyncrasies of the
individual States. "These six laws were obtained," says the
official organ of the American Cosmeticians' Society, "as a
result of much self-sacrifice and hard work on the part of a
small group of women in each of these States. They have
behind them some fine organization work, personal enthu
siasm that could not be dampened by setbacks and misunder
standings, meetings without number, countless hours of
telephoning, hundreds of personal interviews with legisla
tors, weeks given over to lobbying in the State capitals, days
of anxiety and disappointment, and a generous amount of
that necessary thing —cooperation."
In Missouri success was not difficult because the local
branches of the American Cosmeticians' Society and the
National Hairdressers' Association combined forces to push
the bill through. But hearken to what happened in Oregon,
as told by Miss Mary E. Newman, of the National School of
Cosmeticians in Portland:
When newspapers began to ridicule our movement, many
of us who carried the most advertising stopped it immedi
ately, and made a personal appeal to the editors. They re
considered and gave us a splendid write-up.
We hired no lobbyist—we did our own lobbying. We each
tried to look our best and be ladylike, not bold or forward,
and we were listened to with respect, though at first there
was the usual attitude of ridicule.
Our bill passed through Senate and House by a large ma
jority. But not until the governor had signed our bill did
we lessen our vigilance.
The report from New Mexico is almost romantic; thus the
leading newspaper of Santa F£:
When the bill regulating the beauty parlor operators was
introduced, great hilarity ensued and the bill and all its
works were greatly kidded. All that was needed for a laugh
the first three weeks of the session was a casual reference to
the beauty parlor bill. The earnest and good-natured young
ladies who lobbied the bill to a triumphant finish dimpled

merrily at all the jokes, issued frequent invitations to
luncheons and dinners, talked quietly. When the bill came
up for passage it was regarded as seriously as any other
measure in the House.
Miss Evelyn Lazarus, a worker in the same sovereign State,
contributes this record of her personal experience:
Before our bill was presented I had no less than four con
ferences with the Barbers' Union here in Albuquerque. I
can't remember ever having had to do so much fighting
before. The argument waxed so hot about what our line of
work included that it got into personalities. Then again poli
tics were played. . . .
Then our real trouble was to start —in the House. Over
50 per cent of the House is Spanish, and you just talk at
them, not to them. We presented our case to every man
there. Every place and any place we met them they were
lobbied,
(sic!) . A few had their wives with them, which was
a great help to us.
Miss Pinson has that go-get-it smile, and however discour
aged we were, she smiled—in spite of the mean things that
were said to us. . . .
What wonder, then, that the passionate legislators of New
Mexico succumbed, and made cosmetology a licensed and
learned profession!
SCIENTIFIC PLASTIC SURGERY
Following the experience acquired by our surgeons in the
Great War, plastic surgery advanced rapidly. The need for
restoring extensive segments of the skin, for rebuilding facial
contours destroyed by explosives, and for repairing the
ravages of burns by fire or chemicals gave birth to surgical
methods with results nothing short of marvelous. Such
specialists as the English surgeon Gillies and in our country
Vilray P. Blair, J. Eastman Sheehan, and others, have pub
lished vast tomes recording the before and after aspects of
hundreds of patients. A dissemination of the photographs
marked "before" would make most potent propaganda for
the pacifists. The "after" illustrations, revealing the accom

plishments of the surgeons, aided by certain artists in the
creation of artificial noses, ears, toupees, and what not,
arouse gasps of astonishment and almost of unbelief. How
ever great the skepticism of the reader may be, the facts are
nevertheless as depicted by Mr. Gillies.
A few regularly licensed medical men in some of our large
cities have built up tremendous practices in such reconstruc
tive surgery. Merely as an estimate, I should guess that there
are today perhaps ten reputable surgeons in the United
States who do any considerable amount of this work. In addi
tion, each of our large cities maintains from one to ten
practitioners, all regularly licensed but beyond the best
repute and wavering on the shadowy borderland of quackery,
who likewise limit their practices to facial and body recon
struction. Finally, a considerable number of so-called general
surgeons, of surgeons limiting their practice to the ear, nose,
and throat, and of physicians specializing in diseases of the
skin, undertake such procedures on occasion.
THE BEAUTY QUACK
It is not within the purview of this article to define the
marks of the charlatan in plastic surgery. Gradually those
marks are becoming apparent even to credulous Homo
Americanus. Some of the "specialists" advertise openly in the
newspapers, giving a list of the operations which they wish to
undertake. An example follows:

The appeal to secrecy is one of the mainstays of the trade.
The successful results are broadcast by the patient himself
and by the charlatan through the press and through his
advertising literature, but the patient who has had an un
successful result is likely, if he lives, to hide his chagrin in
silence. Occasionally, when the results are especially serious,
they come to light through the medium of the courts. From
several hundreds of instances that are available I select
a few:
Los Angeles, Cal.—Suit for $500,000 has been filed here
against Drs. and , plastic surgeons, by Mrs. .
In Her complaint, Mrs. states the defendants attempted
to remove superfluous flesh from her ankles, but that it
finally became necessary to amputate both legs.

was badly scarred and her eyes so badly crossed she was
obliged to have them straightened by another surgeon "at
great cost and suffering to herself."

that on July iy, Dr. performed an operation to

FADS AND QUACKERY IN HEALING
A dignified, handsomely dressed woman walked into my
office in Chicago in September, 1926. When she removed her
hat and her veil her face revealed the wreckage of an
encounter with one of the most widely advertised plastic
surgeons in America. She had come to him only after Gillies,
some French surgeons, and several in New York had told her
to avoid plastic surgery. But when she was a girl she had
been operated on for removal of some glands in the neck,
and she considered the scar unsightly when she wore an
evening gown.
The Chicago surgeon consented to remove the scar from
the neck, inveigled the lady into a face-peeling operation,
and undertook to do his surgery in his office under a local
anesthetic. The results were pitiful. The caustic acid used in
the face peeling had produced scarring worse than the orig
inal condition. The original scar had been operated on twice
and, as sometimes occurs in such cases, the new scars were
far worse than the old. Portions of the eyebrows had been
removed and the contraction of the scar had left an ex
tremely distorted appearance. Because of the prominence of
her social position the woman could not go into court to
seek financial reparations for the injury done to her body.
One plastic surgeon who is reputed to be most successful
—only, however, from the point of view of the size of his
income—has for several years employed a publicity repre
sentative who is charged with the duties of securing patients
of note, particularly in the theatrical profession, with the
wide dissemination of news of successful results, with the
suppression of newspaper statements about unsuccessful re
sults, and with the promotion of publicity concerning unsuc
cessful surgery by and damage suits against competitors.
In many instances the records of these plastic surgeons are
befogged by doubts as to whether or not they have ever had
medical or surgical training sufficient to qualify them for
undertaking the most simple of operations. Indeed, it is not
clear in some cases that they have even graduated from
reputable medical schools or obtained their licensure by
proper examination. The aspirant for facial reconstruction

will do well to inquire carefully into these matters before
submitting himself to the scalpel.
The competent performer of plastic surgery gets his re
sults by the transplantation of flaps of tissue from one por
tion of the body to another. The manipulation is delicate,
usually demanding the retention of the original blood supply
of the part until a new blood supply develops at the spot to
which the transfer is made. Obviously, here is a procedure to
be carried out only in a good hospital and under the most
aseptic conditions. The growth of such tissue may require
weeks or months. Sometimes a portion of cartilage is trans
ferred also, say to build up the sunken bridge of a nose
that gives the face a dished appearance. The procedure of
the charlatan is to dill a syringe with melted paraffin and to
inject this beneath the skin to fill out the cavity. The par
affin hardens and the patient is satisfied. But experience has
shown that paraffin has the peculiar quality of stimulating
the growth of the tissue cells, and numerous cases are now on
record of the development of disfiguring tumors and even of
cancers after its injection.
On a hot day in July in 1924, there came into my editorial
sanctum a young woman accompanied by a somewhat elderly
man. "Look at that nose," she said, and with the words
demonstrated how the organ referred to might be turned
right, left, upward or downward according to the direction
in which her fingers impelled it. "Dr. did that," she
said. "He promised me that he wouldn't use paraffin, and
then when he got me in the chair he injected it. We've
already paid him $300 for taking the bags out from under
Joe's eyes, but this is terrible." And Joe, whose eyes still
bagged a little, interjected: "I held the umbrella over her
all the way over here so that nose would stay up until we
got here." The lady had small chance of redress, for a com
plaisant State finds it difficult to interfere with the practi
tioners that it has once licensed, and the charlatans, antici
pating difficulties, are protected by insurance companies
which agree to fight their damage suits.

child or adult suffering from cross-eye. The majority of the
cases are caused by eye strain accompanying far-sightedness.
Nowadays the eyes are first examined by a competent eye
specialist, and corrective glasses are tried before any opera
tions are attempted. But the plastic surgery quack guaran
tees to cure by a simple operation, knowing that his guar
antee is worthless. In more severe cases due to a deficiency
of the muscles of the eye, surgeons who have specialized in
the work will shorten a muscle or change its place of inser
tion. Each case demands careful study and accurate measure
ments which the plastic surgery quack is not competent to
make and he can never obtain a competent eye specialist to
help him. In several instances after enough patients have
suffered the loss of an eye, State officials have been able to
secure cancellation of the license to practice.
Cosmetic operations are most commonly sought by elderly
women in love with young men, by aging actresses eager to
continue profitably as ingenues, by women whose husbands
have lost interest in them, by pugilists who have fought to
financial success at the cost of facial continuity, and finally
by foolish little salesgirls, stenographers, clerks, aspirants to
the movies, sheiks, and what not. The most popular opera
tion, perhaps, is that for the reconstruction of the nose, the
most unsatisfactory organ ever devised by an all-wise Creator.
The perfect heroine for novelists stands waiting: She is the
impossible young woman who is perfectly satisfied with the
nose that she was born with. There comes then the correc
tion of outstanding ears, the reconstruction of cauliflower
or tin ears, the removal of "bags" beneath the eyes, the so-
called face-lifting for the elimination of wrinkles or of jowls
that have sagged, the excision of double chins, and, finally,
the removal of fat, principally from the thighs, the hips, the
buttocks, the abdomen, and the breasts.
THE RESULTS OF PLASTIC SURGERY

geons under the best of conditions the results are frequently

ary infection, (b) that the tissues of the patient have
sufficient recuperative power, (c) that the skin of the patient
does not tend to the overgrowth of the scar tissue called
"keloid," (d) that the accumulation of fat is not due to some
inherent disturbance of the bodily processes particularly in
volving the glands of internal secretion, and (e) that the
surgeon is lucky. Unfortunately, there are records of hun
dreds of cases in which the surgeons were not lucky—indeed,
so many that reputable surgeons hesitate to undertake such
procedures unless the defects are flagrantly disfiguring or in
volve a serious disability. During and after the war the gov
ernment provided the wherewithal for stays of many months
in hospitals for soldiers undergoing repeated reconstructive
operations. In the great manufacturing industries patients
are sometimes severely injured through inadvertent contact
with Frankensteinian machines, and it becomes necessary to
rebuild features or to replace scalps that have been torn
away. Great hospitals and funds are available for carrying
on such surgical procedures. But only a few really competent
surgeons find time or inclination for the type of plastic
surgery performed wholly for esthetic reasons. That is the
field which has been invaded and which is largely controlled
by charlatans.
THE CARE OF THE HAIR
Somewhere toward the end of those vaudeville acts in
which a young gentleman and a young lady indulge in acri
monious remarks relative to the merits of the sexes, the lady
is likely to remark: "Well, in one way a woman is smarter
than a man, anyhow." "What's that?" asks the feeder. "Well,
you take a bald-headed man, he buys hair-tonic; but a
woman buys hair."
The truth in the jest is apparent. The promotion, reten
tion and replacement of the hirsutage which is a surviving

oils and pastes for washing and giving luster to the hair,
require the services of thousands of experts. The current
styles of bobbing, shingling or otherwise trimming what
used to be called woman's crowning glory have made the
barber-shop a delicately scented boudoir without even a
cuspidor. Finally, there are the diseases of the hair resulting
from infection with parasites, bacteria, or fungi, which give
concern to the medical specialist in dermatology. With the
desirability or not of the current styles I am not here con
cerned, for I am inquiring more particularly into matters
of fraud and deceit.
Among all the fallacies attaching to the care of the hair
none is so persistent as the belief in the virtues of the so-
called singe, recommended to overcome splitting at the ends
and to prevent the falling out of the hair. The tonsorial
artist avers that the burning of the tip will close the pores
and keep the fluid in the hair. Actually, singeing merely
substitutes a charred blunt end of fused horn for one taper
ing to a point or cut clean across. In fact, splitting of the
ends is more easily controlled by greasing the hair lightly
and supplying it with the fat that is lacking. Singeing the
hair ends in order to prevent the fluid from escaping is
based on the misconception that the hair has a central cavity
through which it is supplied with some sort of nourishing
sap. The hair has no more sap than a buggy-whip; it is
nourished only by the blood that reaches its root. Above the
surface it is simply a spine of horn, which can be oiled from
without.
The removal of superfluous hair is one of the most deli
cate tasks that can confront the dermatologic specialist. The
fact is recognized by those state laws which, as has been men
tioned, throw special safeguards around this procedure and
define the specialty of "electrologist." Most dermatologists
are agreed that the one certain method for permanent de-
pilation is the use of the electric needle. The procedure is
time consuming, somewhat painful, and only from five to
twelve hairs are removed in an ordinary treatment. There

exist numerous chemical depilatories containing caustic
substances, but they irritate the skin at the same time that
they remove the hair, and since they do not destroy the hair
roots they do not remove the hair permanently. There exists
also the possibility of removing superfluous hair by the use
of the X-ray. This method is followed by numerous so-
called "Tricho Institutes," established throughout the
country. But the X-ray is a two-edged sword, possessing
great possibility for serious harm, as well as possibility for
good when used by those familiar with its dangers. Already
specialists in diseases of the skin are reporting the occurrence
of hardening of the upper layers of the skin, or overgrowth
of the cells, known scientifically as precancerous keratosis,
in persons subjected to such treatments. In many of the
colleges for the training of those who wish to devote them
selves to the beauticians' art attempts are made to instruct
in the uses of such apparatus, but the business itself is so
new and the teachers themselves, in most instances, are so
poorly informed concerning the actual anatomy, physiology
and pathology of the skin that it may be said without fear
of overstatement that the majority of persons now using
these methods are not competent.
The removal of moles, warts, and other excrescences upon
the skin is another branch of "cosmetology" that presents
dangerous possibilities. For years physicians have warned
against interference, except by the most careful surgery, with
moles of a deeply pigmented character.
Numerous instances are reported in which cutting, burn
ing, or otherwise tampering with such moles has resulted in
the appearance of cancerous tumors and their rapid dissem
ination throughout the body, resulting in death. The ability
to distinguish between such defects as are benign and such
as are dangerous comes only with extensive study. Obviously,
that knowledge is not to be acquired either by a year's ap
prenticeship in a beauty shop or by six months in a beauty
"college."

BEAUTY PREPARATIONS
Since the profits of the beauty shop are dependent mainly
upon the sale of lotions, creams, shampoos, ointments, de
pilatories, beauty clays, face packs, and similar preparations,
the number of these increases daily. Preparations similar to
most of the beauty clays, costing at retail from $2 to $10 a
pound, may be made by mixing a pound of kaolin, or dried
beauty clay, with the same weight of water. Such a prepara
tion costs 20 cents. Nevertheless, pages in most of the peri
odicals addressed primarily to women contain full page
announcements of Terra-derma-lax, Boncilla, Domino Com
plexion Clay, Mineralava, and Forty-Minute Beauty Clay.
Despite the advertisements, it is quite impossible to feed
the skin by rubbing in fats or creams of any kind. Nor is
cleanliness aided by plastering the surface of the skin with
one type of cream after another and then being compelled
to wash away the entire mess. There is no such thing as a
skin food. The skin can be soothed, inflamed, or made tem
porarily more pliable by external applications, but it can
not be fed. Dozens of preparations for the control of pimples
and blackheads are employed by adolescents, both male and
female, but genuine specialists in diseases of the skin are
likely to recommend simple washing, with the applications
of antiseptic solutions that may be purchased for a few cents.
Mixtures to be used in the bath for the reduction of
weight commonly consist of baking soda or Epsom salts
slightly perfumed, and are sold for twenty to fifty times their
original cost. There is, in fact, hardly a single possibility in
this field that has not been astutely exhausted by the manu
facturers of cosmetic nostrums.
Physicians who conduct newspaper columns devoted to
answering questions from readers find that at least half of
their correspondence is concerned with the problem of
entrancing the opposite sex by displays of healthy beauty.
Warn as one will of the folly of dependence on the cos
metic nostrum, of its inertness and sophistication, hope
springs eternal and the sales go on. There is no limit to the

REJUVENATION
"People expect old men to die
They do not really mourn old men,
Old men are different. People look
At them with eyes that wonder when . . .
People watch with unsbocked eyes . . .
But the old men know when an old man dies."
—Ogden Nash.
There
is no fool like an old fool—particularly in matters
of rejuvenation. For the senile, tottering old men, leer
ing passion and desire, the world has only the pity that it
confers on a Faust, who bartered his soul for a few years of
youthfulness; the ridicule that it darts upon a Don Quixote;
the mild amusement with which it listens to the tale of
Ponce de Leon; or the savagery with which it attacks the
decrepit prey of physical lusts inspired by inflamed tissues,
who slakes his inordinate appetites with the inveiglement of
young girls. Behind all of these legends and observations lie
the insights of historians who have seen fundamental biologic
instincts expressing unsatisfied and hopeless desires. Here
psychologists observe the last expression of the law of self-
preservation, the reaction of the living toward approaching
death, the feeble call on unresponsive nerves and muscles
for power that they cannot give. Today the public is told
again and again in sensation mongering newspapers and
periodicals that the secret of restoring youthful vigor to
worn-out tissues has been solved. Alas! medical scientists
who like to be shown before they are convinced, mistrust
the evidence. They grant readily that the senescent gray

beard with the will-to-believe may be instilled with young
ideas, but they have yet to admit that any surgical operation,
any transplantation of glands, any decoction of plant, organ,
or mineral remedies will confer on the withered form the
machinery to put those ideas into action. Of the mechanical
contrivances, the glandular extracts, and the other forms of
hocus-pocus sold with claims for their ability to rejuvenate
more will be said later. Now and here the disciples of the
scalpel who are reaping somewhat of a harvest in the field
of surgical rejuvenation will receive attention.
Man's search for the elixir of eternal youth was never a
scientific one previous to the period of Brown-Sequard. Long
before Brown-Sequard, however, anatomists and physiologists
had been studying the nature and the functions of the male
sex glands. It had been shown that the ability to reproduce
was coordinate with certain changes in the body of the child
that are known as the secondary sex characteristics. The
voice of the boy depends, causing great embarrassment
when a fine soprano statement suddenly changes to a basso
growl. The first inklings of mustache and beard send him
to his mirror for hours of painstaking scrutiny. He begins to
take a more serious interest in the female of the species.
And it was taken for granted that the development of these
sex characteristics was the result of a special or internal secre
tion poured into the blood by the sex glands. In science,
however, it is not well to take anything for granted.
In 1889, the famous French physiologist thought that he
had discovered the potent substance in the extracts of male
sex glands. One need not be a Freudian to realize that the
terms vim, vigor, virility, or vitality are almost invariably
associated with sexual power and the ability to engage in
the act of reproduction. It was not strange, therefore, that
attention should be turned to these organs in the search
for the important substance. Indeed, the most primitive
savages of cannibalistic nature were wont themselves to brew
essences of the organs of the enemies whom they slew in
battle, believing that the ingestion of the tissues was
sufficient to confer upon them the prowess of their van

quished foes. Nor is it surprising that Brown-Sequard, having
inoculated himself with extracts of sex organs, developed a
sort of similitude of youthfulness. He reported that he could
now climb a flight of steps with greater rapidity and ease
than before his inoculation. Nevertheless, at the appointed
time, the body of Brown-Sequard went the way of all flesh.
And the skeptical scientists who repeated his experiments,
checking them with numerous cases and controlling them
with injections of plain water instead of the extracts, shook
their heads in dismay. The great scientist —for Brown-
Sequard was all of that —had yielded science to enthusiasm,
and his conclusions could not be sustained.
steinach's theory
About 1903 two French biologists claimed that the secre
tion responsible for maleness was developed by a certain part
of the male sex gland. They asserted that this portion of the
gland developed particularly if the tubes leading from the
gland were tied off so that the portion responsible for pro
ducing the male cells of reproduction would degenerate.
And Steinach claimed that he had confirmed their experi
ments, and that the performance of this operation on
senescent animals resulted in rejuvenation.
Now the finding of a substance or a system of rejuvenation
is much like the finding of gold. Whether it is there or not,
all of the unsuccessful, romantic, and adventurous experi
menters rush in on the trail, and all of the aged and worn
out capitalists come in as soon as convenient to take advan
tage of the discovery. The cry of "gold, gold," was taken up
quickly by a number of young and enthusiastic investigators,
who followed Steinach. Some famous actors, physicians, and
financiers, who saw the waning of their power and note and
of their ability to enjoy to the utmost the lives that had given
them so much, became subjects of the experiment. Where
there are actors, authors, and financiers, there is also always,
in these modern times, good newspaper publicity. And where
there is newspaper publicity not too careful as to the facts,

REJUVENATION
there are soon more applicants for operations. This, in
medical science, is known as a vicious circle.
The careful experimenters who have followed the work of
Steinach, checking all his results carefully on experimental
animals, have demolished his claims bit by bit. Oslund of
the Vanderbilt Medical School showed that the Steinach
adherents had been deceived because of the type of experi
mental animal used. Since the theory of rejuvenescence is
based on an overdevelopment of the cells within the sex
gland that does not actually occur, it can be taken for granted
that cutting of the ducts with the idea of producing such
overdevelopment cannot cause rejuvenescence. And the work
of Oslund has been confirmed by Moore and many others.
In a recent consideration of the topic of rejuvenation, Dr.
William T. Belfield demolishes the belief that the sex glands
are responsible for the development of the secondary sex
characteristics in two succinct statements: The complete sex
features of mind and body, including the external sex organs,
have been found in persons in whom the so-called sex glands
were absent from birth, as proved by complete postmortem
examination. Furthermore, all of the sex features of the male
sex, including the external organs, have been found in per
sons in whom the sex glands were absent from birth, but
who had within the body a complete set of female sex glands.
There is a great deal of much more technical evidence to
support the view that the sex glands are not the only tissues
concerned with establishing maleness or femaleness of any
individual. Perhaps the best of it developed in experiments
on hens and roosters, revealing hens possessing the comb and
wattles and even the feathers of the rooster, yet living a hen's
life, laying eggs and hatching them out! But what, you ask,
has all of this to do with Steinach's theory of rejuvenation?
The elderly gentleman who prefers blondes is hardly likely
to be deterred, by the details of technical experiments on
mice, rabbits, chickens or dogs. For him, therefore, one
presents the facts regarding man. For many years the opera
tion now called the Steinach rejuvenation operation was
performed on old men who suffered from enlargement of

another organ closely associated with the sexual tissues. This
gland—the prostate —first received newspaper respectability
when its enlargement in the case of a noted holder of public
office gave it great diplomatic importance. But in not one
of the hundreds of cases of cutting of the ducts reported
previous to the time of Steinach did any of the meticulous
surgeons who reported the cases mention any restoration of
youthful vigor or anything resembling rejuvenation. This
fact has been called to the attention of Steinach and of all
his followers again and again in reputable medical publica
tions.
To the proof of the scientific laboratory investigators that
the Steinach method is founded on fallacy, the Steinach
adherents and the surgeons who perform the Steinach opera
tion reply with the sort of cynical shrug of the shoulders that
such practical men use in answering laboratory evidence.
They point with none too reluctant pride to their records of
cases operated on and to the letters of testimony. Here is a
simple gesture but hardly the sort of thing one expects from
a scientist. The same testimonials—in fact much stronger
ones—can be found for all of the nostrums and contrivances
that have invaded this fertile field.
Opposed to the enthusiastic statement of Adolph Lorenz,
to whom personal newspaper exploitation is no novelty, is
that of Professor M. Zeissl of Vienna, that the only change
he noted after his operation was less frequent sex desire
than previously. There are some records of senile men who
put upon their degenerated tissues far more of stress than
they could tolerate. Here the illusion of vigor produced an
earlier death than might reasonably have occurred without
the operation and in the absence of illusion. It is in connec
tion with this phase of the matter that the feline comes leap
ing forth from the enveloping sack in which it has heretofore
been somewhat cautiously concealed.
In the earlier publications of the followers of Steinach,
one finds no mention of any possible mental effects asso
ciated with the surgical procedure. But quite recently they
mutter vaguely concerning the importance of coincident psy

choanalysis. Apparently the patient must believe thoroughly
that the operation will give him vim, vigor, and vitality, or
he doesn't get it. For many years, physicians who have
specialized in the diseases of the sex organs have emphasized
again and again the great part played by the mind in con
trolling their functions. The records of the surgeons who do
the Steinach operations are without scientific controls. To
what extent have they checked their work by cases on whom
the operation was not done, but who otherwise were put
through the same procedure? Obviously such controlling of
cases would be a most elementary and simple procedure, but
records of such control in the publications of the promoters
are sadly lacking.
Indeed, these exponents of surgical art would seem to be
providing for the future in their claim that the operation
may be repeated with good effect and a second revival of
powers bestowed on the waning patient. Here is a biologic
revolution that bewilders the imagination! The young men,
handicapped in competition because of lack of experience
and of the world's goods, will be compelled to struggle
against their rejuvenated fathers and grandfathers, while the
latter, by repeated operations, maintain a permanent lead.
It's a sad, sad outlook; but fortunately it isn't true.
THE VORONOFF CONCEPTION
The contention of Voronoff, like that of Steinach, has to
do with the use of sex gland material for purposes of re
juvenation. He does not, however, depend on any change in
the tissues brought about by tying off ducts. He actually
transplants the entire glands, and since the human material
is not easily and generally available, attempts to supply the
deficiency with glands derived from the anthropoid apes. In
this instance also a vast amount of experimental evidence
from the past and from other workers of the present is avail
able to disprove the contention that either virility or vigor
depend primarily on secretion from the sex glands. True,
there are instances in which there is obvious deficiency of
the sex glands and in which the transplantation of such

material results in conserving useful existence, but the
records again are not such as will convince any scientific
reader of the merit of the operation. In the first place there
is not in any sense of the word actual prolongation of life,
since none of those on whom the transplants have been done
seem to live beyond the normal period. In the second place,
one reads such conclusions as the following: "The pessi
mistic attitude of the patient and constant brooding over his
inability have marred the results of the treatment." Here,
again, the part played by the will-to-believe seems para
mount. When all of the evidence is assembled and con
sidered en masse, it becomes apparent that there is not as
yet any actual proof that rejuvenation has been accomplished
in a single individual, or any basis for the belief that it ever
will be accomplished. There is, on the other hand, much
evidence that a few surgeons, whose names are seen more
often in the newspapers than in scientific periodicals, have
found rejuvenation operations most valuable in their prac
tice. Valuable to whom?
MECHANICAL REJUVENATION
The astute purveyors of mechanical devices, pills, lotions,
and systems of physical culture sold by the mail-order plan
have been quick to realize the wonderful "come-on" possi
bilities inherent in the word. The result has been the in
terminable repetition of the claim for renewed youth
achieved through hundreds of substances and appliances.
The post-office department itself is hardly able to keep pace
with the new developments in the field, and its fraud orders
are issued usually after the promoters have reaped a fine
harvest.
The senescent man or the youthful individual who finds
himself suddenly lacking in sexual vigor is a ready prey for
the exploiters of mechanical devices which are urged because
of their ability to encourage a physical development that
seems to be lacking. The average man in this land of unen-
lightenment regarding the physical constitution has but

affairs, either as to physical development or functional
ability. Indeed, the more he meditates upon the matter, the
more he is likely to be convinced that he himself is sadly
lacking in these particulars, the psychology of this view being
dependent upon a will to achieve rather than on actual
knowledge. Moreover, the cleverly worded literature —and
what a sad use of the word this is—of the salesman of various
devices is calculated to intensify and emphasize this view.
All of the advertising matter is a paean of praise of sexual
athleticism, and a weeping and wailing, inspired to make
still more mournful the sexually despondent male.
On December 5, 1925, the post-office department issued a
fraud order against the manufacturers of a device known as
the "Perfection Developer," one Walter H. Hartman of
Columbus, Ohio, selling under the firm name of "Hart &
Co." The simple device was merely a cylinder of glass con
nected with a pump and designed to induce a vacuum about
the organs to be developed. The effects persisted only so
long as the device was in actual use, and if it had any
permanent effects whatever, they could only be for harm.
Another device of the same type was sold by one M. von
Schwartz and William Billings of Ithaca, New York, under
the name of the "Burt Vacuum Tube." This firm was de
barred from the mails September 1, 1925. And there are
many, many others!
These devices are typical of most of the mechanical appli
ances offered by mail for men lacking sexual vigor.
Obviously, they can be of no permanent service. Moreover,
the psychology of their use is such as to discourage any real
possibility of improvement through rest, diet, and psycho
therapy which long experience has shown are of value.

In March, 1921, the "Youth Gland Chemical Labora
tories" was incorporated in Illinois; in February, 1922, the
name of the corporation was changed to the "Druesen-Kraft
Chemical Laboratories." Later, it became known as the
"Lewis Laboratories." It was not, however, until March 19,
1925, that the United States Government closed the mails to
this concern. In the meantime, it reaped a rich harvest from
the unwary. The advertising literature of this concern was
of a style so striking as to have merited some better use. A
full-page announcement in the newspapers was headed, in
two inch high, black type, "your glands wear out"; in the
center of the page, he-men and she-women danced the one

treatment was $ 10, which, on occasion, could be reduced to
$7.50, and, if the victim still failed to succumb, to a special
offer of $2.95. The court records in the case showed that the
firm had spent at least $300,000 in advertising, and that it
had a gross annual income of between $250,000 and $300,-
000. Nevertheless, scientific evidence has shown that extracts
or other preparations of the sex glands are without any
power whatever when taken by mouth. They not only fail to
produce rejuvenation of the entire body, but even to stim
ulate to any extent the particular portions of the body in
which the applicant for rejuvenation seems to be especially
interested.
Another concern, with headquarters in Denver, issued a
booklet entitled "The Secret of Staying Young." Here were
the testimonials of elderly men, 82, 83, and 84 years of age,
who announced that they had lasting benefits from the treat
ments offered. These testimonials are just as vociferous and
emphatic as those of aspirants for youth operated on by the
disciples of Steinach. The treatments consisted of nothing
more than dried animal glands, taken by mouth, which, as
has been said, could not possibly have the effects claimed
for them. The concern exploiting these desiccated glands,
the "Vital-O-Gland Company," not content with depending

ries of youth become more and more resplendent with the
passing years.
The Glandine Laboratories of Chicago and Los Angeles
issues a circular with the question "Must We Grow Old?"
and with the answer, "Science Says No." The treatments
consist of extracts of the sex glands to be taken by mouth.
The Glandex Company of New York advertised in the
public press a combination of gland extracts with iron. The
International Research Laboratories of Chicago advertised
"Baker's Glandol," with a salacious pamphlet emphasizing
the rejuvenation of man, and with such headings as "The
Most Interesting Thing is Love. Don't Waste Life. Luck
from Boldness, and Suppressed Desires." Where is the man
who could resist the plea?
The Puritan Laboratories of Nashville, Tennessee, issues
"Glandtone," offered with the claim that it will restore
youthful vigor to those passing with age. The Walton
Chemical Company of Chicago emphasizes the glands and
says that a combination of the sex glands, the thyroid, pros
tate, pituitary, and adrenal, hermetically sealed, will defer
old age and renew vitality. What of the impudence and psy
chological cleverness of its warning:
WARNING!
The country is being flooded with literature from so-
called "Laboratories," offering to restore Sex STRENGTH
in the forms of unsealed "Gland Tablets" or "Liquids."
Such preparations may contain some gland substance,
but unless the ingredients are SEALED to preserve their
strength, the potency may be entirely gone in a few days.
The Walton Treatment INSURES the STRENGTH of
the INGREDIENTS and thousands have found this method
SUCCESSFUL even after years and years of previous failure
with other methods of treatment.
In fact, fully three out of four who write of their remark

tion, have ever been shown to have the slightest effect on the
human body when given by mouth. It was the hope and the
belief of Brown-Sequard that he had found such a substance.
Even he thought that the taking of sex glands brought about
in him a sort of rejuvenation. Yet in the more than fifty years
since his passing, and since his claims were disproved, the
public has not learned the truth.
RADIUM AND LIGHT
With the coming of the newer discoveries in medicine as
to the effects on the human body of radium, the x-ray, and
ultraviolet light, the agile-minded exploiters of the public's
interest in keeping young were again quick to respond with
the preparation and sale of such apparatus and material for
purposes of rejuvenation. Of course, rejuvenation is not a
physical state that can easily be determined accurately. The
old man with declining powers is ready to welcome the
slightest sign of increasing ability in physical work or in
sexual power. He forgets to reason that the rest and the
mental stimulation associated with any new method of treat
ment are likely to bring about the illusion of strength.
The manufacturer of a cabinet lined with incandescent
lamps, for example, is not content to claim for it the simple
uses of a sweat bath, or of heat produced by incandescent
lamps. Ah! No! This simple cabinet becomes as by the wave
of a magician's wand, an "Inductive Metabolizing method."
And the manufacturer says:
The Inductive Metabolizing method gives to the
world one of the greatest, if not the greatest, means of re
juvenation of the human organism known to medicine, but
the part that is most interesting about this modality is that
of its synergetic action with all the recognized methods of
rejuvenation now in use —such as gland therapy, radioactive
drinking water, baths, etc., as the results obtained by their
use, when accompanied by the Inductive Metabolizing treat
ments, are increased tenfold.
One can almost picture him rubbing his hands in glee as he
murmurs: "Rejuvenation: That's the word that gets 'em!"

The makers of apparatus containing radium or the
blenders of waters which have been submitted to the rays of
this wondrous element urge also its potency for rejuvena
tion. They point knowingly to the radioactive springs of
Germany and Switzerland and cite the records of the old
men who have visited those springs and returned home
younger in body, if not in years. But they, too, neglect the
effects of weeks of rest and freedom from care, of good diet
and salubrious surroundings, and possibly —in fact, prob
ably—of enforced inactivity for those portions of the
anatomy whose physical functioning persists in remaining
the center of interest when rejuvenation is discussed.
"the new science of radiendocrinology"
If radiation rejuvenates —although of course it doesn't —
and if glands rejuvenate—and it has been shown that they
do not—then, say the manufacturers of the Radiendocrin-
ator, the combination will get the result. Merely ray the
glands with the Radiendocrinator —price $150
—and you are
there! The booklets are a hodgepodge of exaggerations,
fallacies, and confusions regarding chemistry, physics, bi
ology, glands, radium, and what not. But the convincing
document is a blue-colored bonded guarantee of satisfaction
or money refunded. Couched in language that seems to make
the chance of financial loss to the unwary impossible, the
guarantee is nevertheless a snare and a delusion. Launched
originally by Dr. Herman H. Rubin, New York, as a device
to be worn at night over the glands and selling at $1,000,
the apparatus is now a reflector on a stand and can be pur
chased for $150. But for pure romance the literature is at
least ten times as fanciful.
Quite recently newspapers reported the death of Mr. Eben
M. Byers, age 51, of Pittsburgh, who had been for some years
taking regularly a patent medicine containing radium, with
the understanding that it would bring him back the youth
that had gone from his aging tissues. Electroscopic tests, the
history of this case, and the postmortem examination prove
definitely that Mr. Byers died of poisoning by radium. The

preparation which he had been taking was called "radithor"
and was found in tests made by Dr. Frederick B. Flinn of
Columbia University to contain two micrograms of radio
active material in solution. Water jars lined with carnotite
or uranium, which are presumed to provide radium drink
ing water for purposes of rejuvenation, constitute a potential
danger because of the possibility of dangerous metallic sub
stances being dissolved out into the water.
Radium emanation is toxic to some extent. The emana
tions from a gram of radium bromide will kill mice in two
days. No one has really proved that radium emanation does
anything in the way of rejuvenating the aging tissues. Since
its exact possibilities for harm have not been established, the
wise old man will let it alone.
THE HOPE FOR THE FUTURE
Even the Greek philosophers murmured that physical
powers in matters of sex did not always parallel brain capac
ity. Strange that the sex instinct should be so deeply rooted
and so prominent in life that two thousand years of experi
ence has failed to convince men of the truthfulness of that
statement.
Modern science has shown that the early detection of signs
of disease by physical examination, and the establishment of
a proper regime of life, including adequate rest, diet, exer
cise, simple personal hygiene, and freedom from worry will
greatly extend the life of the average man. He may quite
reasonably hope to live to seventy years, and if he is at all
careful, considerably beyond that age. It behooves him then
to grow old gracefully, remembering that much of the
greatest work of this world that has been done in art, letters,
invention, finance, and statesmanship has been done by men
well beyond sixty years of age. Their minds were perhaps
little given to the purely pleasurable functions of the bodies
which constituted the abode for their restless spirits.
Yes, indeed, you can give an old man young ideas, but no
one has ever yet found out how to give him the machinery
to put those ideas into effect.

XVII
THE PROBLEM OF BIRTH CONTROL
"Nothing is more dangerous than science without poetry, technical
progress without emotional content. The proof lies in the hypertrophied
intellectuality and rationality of our age, and the simultaneous de
generation of sentiment to the sub-human level" —H. St. Chamberlain.
In
his presidential address before the American Medical
Association in 1924, Dr. William Allen Pusey considered
limitation of population, and brought to the support of an
argument for birth control most of the familiar facts about
the impossibility of supporting the population of the future
on the land of the present. "If no effort is made at birth
control," said Dr. Pusey, "nature will take charge of the
situation by eliminating those less able to resist." Con
tinuing his argument, he cited the contention of the
economists that those people inherit the earth who multiply
most rapidly, and that fecundity increases inversely accord
ing to the individual's position in the social scale. It seemed
to him, as it has seemed to others, that this means the down
fall of modern Christian civilization, with the triumph of
the misery and degradation of Asia. "I particularly desire,"
he concluded, "that the mistaken impression should not go
out that I mean to say that medicine now has any satisfactory
program for birth control. It has not."
In the tomes of the ardent economists, biologists, sociolo
gists, and philosophers who favor birth control, the eager
reader will also search futilely for any practical program. His
disappointment will not, moreover, depend entirely on the
fact that our government, either wisely or unwisely, has

made unlawful the dissemination of such knowledge as is
available. The fact is thatjione of the students of the
problem, hot even the physicians, has ever perfected any
mHHocT oF birth control that is physiologically, psycho
logically, and biologically sound in both principle and prac
tice. NoL of course, that devices for the prevention of con
ception do not exist; it is well known that they do, and that
they are easily available to almost any purchaser in any
drug store in America. Really the police disturb themselves
much less about violation of the laws on birth control than
about those having to do with liquor or singing. The diffi
culty lies primarily in the imperfection of the devices them
selves, and in the peculiar psychology of the lower stratum
of society which the birth control enthusiasts insist must be
brought to the light, lest its descendants inherit the earth.
Every practical psychologist knows that such folk are not
at all interested in the welfare of the United States as it may
be one hundred years from now. The desire to plan for pos
terity—and that posterity not the next succeeding genera
tion, but of four generations ahead —connotes a high order
of intelligence and public spirit. The impulse to sacrifice the
pleasure of the moment for the profit of a far removed future
is within the moral scope, and always will be, of very few /
'
men, and perhaps of an even smaller number of women.
But more important than this lack of altruistic imagination
is the lack of any sure device for birth control. Of all those
at present available, the most ancient and mosr certain of
all is that of simple continence. The chaste man or woman,
obviously, never has a child. It is the contention of many
religious and prudish persons that this continence is the only
aid to the limitation of offspring that is approved by moral
law. It is, on the other hand, the belief of most modern
psychologists, and especially of the Freudians, that absolute
continence in the presence of continuous temptation, such
as must inevitably appear in the case of marriage between
two persons who have for each other a profound affection,
produces effects on the mental life and the daily behavior
that are not conducive to a peaceful and healthful existence.

Continence is hardly likely, therefore, to appeal to the more
intelligent members of the community. And it is only by
the more intelligent members of the community that one
may expect it to be practiced at all! The visible result of its
impracticability among less reflective persons is apparent in
the very fecundity that our socially minded uplifters de
plore. Even recognizing the fact that the long and piteous
documents from working women printed in Mrs. Margaret
Sanger's Birth Control Review are especially selected be
cause they are long and piteous, they may be considered,
nevertheless, as evidence that continence does not work
among the poor.
BIRTH CONTROL BY CONTINENCE
As everyone knows, there are short periods in the life of a
woman, recurring regularly, in which the likelihood of con
ception is less than at other times. These are, however, so
indeterminate, and the modifying factors are so many, that
those who have attempted to rely on them to limit their
offspring have been invariably surprised at their failure.
All the remaining methods now in use are mechanical and
chemical. Do they work? Recently the best authorities avail
able in Great Britain conducted a symposium on the subject.
It was the general verdict that all were unsatisfactory,
although a majority agreed that a commonly known device,
invented some centuries ago by an Italian named Fallopius,
was better than the rest. The name of Fallopius is attached
to the Fallopian tubes in women—they conduct the ovum
from the ovaries to the uterus —and not to tne elastic tube
here concerned. The percentage of efficiency of the available
devices varies from ten to somewhere about ninety per cent;
none of them is perfect. But ninety per cent is not to be dis
regarded! Moreover, some of them may produce irritations of
the tissues and grave consequences, including cancer. Their
psychological effects are too well known to require dis
cussion.

for killing any sort of organism within the human body lies

in the fact that any solution that is sufficiently strong to kill
is also sufficiently strong to irritate and destroy the living
body cells. So with all the chemical substances thus far pro
posed for destroying or inhibiting the activity of either the
ovum of the female or the sperm of the male. Practically all
such substances are subject to the charge that they are too
weak to be efficient, or so strong as to be distinctly injurious
to the tissues, especially if used frequently. On such devices
there is never any agreement.
A list of contraceptive methods recently developed by one
authority includes chemical and mechanical methods, meth
ods requiring no apparatus, permanent methods, and physio
logic methods.
CHEMICAL CONTRACEPTIVES
The chemical methods comprise all sorts of antiseptics,
such as are commonly advertised in these times in our best
magazines with the vague allusion to feminine hygiene that
modern censorship condones. The chemical substances, sup
posedly able to destroy the male germ cell, come in the form
of douches, powders, tablets, suppositories, and jellies, all of
which are somewhat smeary and subject to the disadvantages
notoriously attached to chemical manipulations. They re
quire, furthermore, immediate application, which has, to
many a sensitive woman, seemed to be in the nature of a
nuisance and a trial. Many a psychologist, particularly of the
Freudian group, who delve so intimately into feminine
reminiscences, has found the necessity for these postcon-
tactual ablutions sufficient to bring about psychasthenic, if
not hysterical, states.
The mechanical devices include not only the apparatus
worn by the male and donned at the appropriate moment,
but also various devices to be used by the female and placed
in position well in advance of the occasion when she may
consider them to be necessary. The time of many a clinic for
teaching such methods is devoted to giving lessons in the
application of the device as well as to its sale; neverthe
less there has been many a failure due to the occlusive de

vice being improperly placed. Some devices placed perma
nently within the female generative organ yield obstructions
and irritations, which, as has been mentioned, are not in
frequently associated with the development of cancer.
All of the methods which depend on will power rather
than apparatus make demands on the psychological mechan
isms to such an extent that their users are found among the
clientele of specialists in nervous and mental disease. True,
many a religious cult, such as the Oneida Community, has
taught its participants technics involving interruption and
reservation, but these, it must be observed, follow the proce
dure as a religious observance and not as a technic for the
avoidance of progeny.
Each of the chief advocates of birth control has some
method which he or she considers the ideal. But the fact
that Mrs. Sanger, Mrs. Stopes, Miss Rout and Miss Bocker
do not agree should be sufficient evidence in itself that the
ideal has not been reached.
PSYCHOLOGY AND BIRTH CONTROL
Little is said by such propagandists about the psychologi
cal aspect of birth control, but this obviously is a matter of
the greatest importance. The psychological factor, indeed, is
largely responsible, not only for the frequent failure of all
the common devices when applied under even the best of
conditions, but also for the reluctance to utilize them, im
perfect as they are, in the lower ranks of society. It would be
possible here, if this were a popular, rather than a scientific,
consideration of the subject, to picture a nocturnal scene be
tween a male of the lower stratum, somewhat stimulated by
alcohol, and the feminine partner of his misery, weary after
a day at the washtub or scrubbing the halls of an apartment
house. The mental states of the two, it must be plain, are
hardly such as to lead them to pause for a consideration of
their own difficulties, much less of the economic problems
of the twenty-first century. The stimulated emotions of the
male, coupled with the fatigued inhibitions of the female,

are little likely to encourage a recourse to complex mechan
isms in the name of humanity.
RESEARCH ON CONTRACEPTION
Medical science is not yet satisfied with the achievements
of its investigators in this field. Research workers are still
seeking methods which are scientifically safe and psychologi
cally satisfactory. The two technics to which most attention
is being given at this time involve the use of the X-rays and
the biologic process involved in the creation of immunity.
It has been shown that exposure of the ovary in the female
or of the testis in the male to a sufficient dosage of X-rays
results in atrophy or deterioration of the tissues, and so
causes permanent sterility. But the human tissues vary so
greatly in resistance and the dosage of X-rays sufficient to
produce the required effect without also producing other
and much more harmful effects is so difficult to calculate,
that the method is not as yet practical.
The other method has been the outgrowth of experi
ments by such investigators as Guyer, Dittler, Metchnikoff,
and McCartney. A proper understanding of it involves a
knowledge of the biologic mechanism within the human
body which results in the production of immunity to disease.
It is known that a person who is infected with certain dis
eases develops resistance to future infection with those dis
eases by the creation within his body of antagonistic sub
stances. In the same way, the injection into the body of
certain chemical substances causes it to build up a defense
against them. It therefore occurred to the investigators
named to find out whether or not the female organism might
be immunized against the sperm cell of the male. They were
supported in their belief that it might be so immunized by
observations which seemed to indicate that the female tended
in time, under the ordinary process of exposure, to develop
immunity to the male sperm. It is known, for instance, that
the liability to become pregnant is much greater during
the early years of marriage than in the later years. It is
known also that there is little tendency to become preg

nant among prostitutes, and that this fact is not altogether
the result of the chronic venereal infections to which this
class is subject. Finally, it was observed that there was a sub
normal tendency to pregnancy in periods following unusu
ally frequent exposure.
The investigators prepared extracts and other preparations
of the sperm cells of various animals, such as rabbits, albino
rats, and chickens. These were injected into females and
careful observations were made to determine whether or not
they had any effect on fecundity. It was found that a definite
effect did appear. Female albino rats injected with the sperm
of the male remained sterile for a period of from two to
twenty-two weeks beyond the normal gestation time, al
though their normal sexual cycle and behavior seemed to be
in no way altered. These experiments were carefully con
trolled by injecting an equal number of rats with salt solu
tion or other innocuous material. In 1926, however, R. M.
Oslund reviewed the subject so far as experiments on rats,
rabbits, and guinea pigs are concerned and concluded that
any delay in conception that occurred in these experiments
was the result of a general disturbance of the body by the
injection of the substance rather than any specific effect of
the injected compound on the male and female elements
concerned in conception.
The government of Soviet Russia has recognized economic
distress as an indication for the prevention of conception
and is sponsoring research leading to the devising of a bio
logic method applicable to women. Kastromium and Karta-
shev of the Perm Institute of Bacteriology in East Soviet
Russia have done extensive experimentation on rabbits and
guinea pigs and have reported definite results in preventing
conception in the injected animals following the injection
of sperm cells. J. Jarcho, who has cited their experiments,
repeated the work on rabbits in this country and found that,
whereas many of the controls became pregnant, none of
those that were injected conceived, even over a period of
six months. Much more experimentation is needed, how

ever, before anything definite can be said as to the actual
merit of this technic even in animals.
Other Russian investigators have experimented on human
beings. A summary of their results is given by Babadagly of
Odessa, whose paper is available through translation into
Spanish. Babadagly cites experiments with this method on
human beings by Schorokova, Kolpikof and Lalin. Appar
ently more than a hundred women have submitted them
selves to such experimentation. Of seventy injected by Lalin,
five became pregnant during the next five months. In the
injections made by Kolpikof, sterility lasted from eight to
ten months. Apparently the injections are harmless, but the
work done is certainly not sufficient to define either the limi
tations or the possibilities.
G. Lombard Kelly has just made available the results of
experiments on guinea pigs, made with a view to determin
ing the effects of injections of the female sex hormone on
conception and on pregnancy. It has been shown that the
female sex hormone is the active agent in producing estrus
and that injections of this hormone would throw even cas
trated animals into heat. In previous studies Kelly had found
that injections of the serum from pregnant women would
delay the onset of estrus in guinea pigs, which was inter
preted to mean an excess of corpus luteum in the blood of
the woman during gestation. These observations would seem
to indicate an antithetic action between the female sex hor
mone and the corpus luteum hormone. Experiments by
Smith indicated that the injection of the female sex hor
mone into pregnant white rats would terminate the preg
nancy if it had not exceeded five days. Other investigators
also, using white mice, were able to prevent conception and
to interrupt pregnancy at any stage with comparatively small
doses of the sex hormone. In an attempt to confirm these
observations on guinea pigs, Kelly found that small doses
of the female sex hormone injected for several days into fe
male guinea pigs immediately after exposure would prevent
conception in all cases in which an adequate dosage was
used. With a dose ten times as great it was possible to in

terrupt pregnancy in the animal when about two weeks
pregnant, and with a dose fifteen times as great it was pos
sible to terminate gestation after four weeks of pregnancy.
In guinea pigs pregnant from six to eight weeks, injections
of dosages from thirty to a hundred times as great brought
an end to the pregnancy and almost invariably caused the
death of the mother. Notwithstanding intensive study, it was
impossible to determine certainly the cause of death. Ap
parently the deaths were not due to the injected material
for the simple reason that dosages six hundred times the
dose necessary to prevent conception, when injected into
male or nonpregnant female guinea pigs were apparently not
incompatible with life or health. Obviously these observa
tions have a direct bearing on many factors concerned in
sterility, the prevention of conception, abortion, and similar
subjects. No doubt further research will bring to light addi
tional results of importance.
In addition to such investigations as have been mentioned,
attempts toward the production of sterility have been made
by L. Haberlandt, who first transplanted into the female
the ovaries of pregnant animals and who more recently has
used ovarian extracts given by mouth. Haberlandt is con
vinced that preparations can be developed which will have
the power of preventing conception even when taken by
mouth. Indeed, German writers are already discussing the
legal limitations that should be placed on the sale and dis
tribution of such preparations. Other experimenters are
looking into the possibility of producing artificial sterility
through the limitation of vitamin E in the diet. The work
cited is an indication of the extensive interest in this subject
throughout the world and would seem to suggest the like
lihood of a successful result some time in the future.
Obviously, if science is able to develop some such method
as these, which will permit the production of sterility in
individuals of the lower stratum with their own consent,
which will be renewable after a definite period, and which
will not depend for its effectiveness on any mental or physi

SOME FOOD FADS
"Man is a carnivorous production,
And must have meals, at least one meal a day;
He cannot live, like woodcocks, upon suction,
But, like the shark and tiger, must have prey;
Although his anatomical construction
Bears vegetables, in a grumbling way,
Your laboring people think beyond all question,
Beef, veal and mutton better for digestion."
Byron—"Don Juan."
Of
all the people of the world, Americans are most cursed
with faddists; of all of the faddists that occupy our at
tention the food faddists are most eccentric and most comi
cal. We have those who believe that the eating of more white
bread, more whole wheat bread, more fruit, or more raisins
is necessary to healthful living.
We are admonished at every turn to eat more of this or
of that, or to confine ourselves wholly to some peculiar diet.
We have those who oppose acids and those who oppose
alkalis. The vegetarians who attach undue evils to the eat
ing of meat base their conclusions on the fact that the apes
live on nuts, fruits, and cereals. Since most faddists are un
scientific anyway, they are certainly inconsistent. The vege
tarians say that animals living on a vegetable diet are strong
and tractable, while the meat-eating animals are ferocious.
Who, however, would care to argue that the mind of man
is governed by what he eats?
Of course, the sufferer from indigestion or the man dis
turbed by chronic attacks of inflammation of the gall blad
der or of the appendix is likely to be irritable and a gener

ally unsatisfactory cuss to have in your circle of friends.
Nevertheless, many of our greatest humorists and most effi
cient leaders have been men who abused alcohol and tobacco
and who ,were epicureans at the dining table. There is some
thing more to temperament and to brains than the eating
of steak, oats, or fish. The old proverb, "Tell me what you
eat and I will tell you what you are," was more a supersti
tion than a scientific fact.
There is not the slightest scientific evidence to support
the view that the eating of wholesome quantities of any
single article of diet such as meat, bread, or any other of the
fundamental foods is dangerous.
FASTING FOR HEALTH
Of all of the peculiar faddists of modern times, the most
preposterous are those who insist on the fast way to health.
The fasting road is the way to digestive ruin. The folly of
fasting was long ago shown by medical scientists, and has
recently been reiterated by many others. An occasional absti
nence from food may be helpful in giving the tissues a rest.
Prolonged fasting is never necessary and invariably does
harm. As a result, the intestinal tissues lose their motility,
and there is a tendency to stagnation all along the intestinal
tract. As a result of the absence of food, waste products,
such as bile and mucus, are reabsorbed, and the body is
likely to suffer to some extent with poisoning from this mat
ter. As evidence of the dangers of such fasting, there is con
stant increase in toxic substances to be found in the body
excretions.
Moreover, the person who is fasting fails to have his regu
lar intake of the necessary vitamins. It has been shown that
the absence of these vitamins from the diet results in seri
ous symptoms apart from malnutrition. Hemorrhages from
the gums, disturbance of the eye, increased liability to infec
tion, and wasting of the body are a few of the dangers.

FADS AND QUACKERY IN HEALING
FLETCHERIZATION
More than a quarter of a century ago a man named Horace
Fletcher found that thorough chewing of the food was an aid
to digestion and nutrition. Like all faddists, however, he
was not satisfied with reestablishing a simple fact that had
been known for centuries, but finally came to believe that
his chewing reform was the greatest discovery of all times
and would revolutionize the world. Eventually, Mr. Fletcher
found that when he chewed thoroughly he ate less than pre
viously, and he finally came to the view that but little food
was necessary and that any food that could not be liquefied
in the mouth should be avoided. The result of such a pro
nouncement was a thorough disturbance of the entire body
and the development of intoxication and general disability.
Professor William James, the great psychologist, is quoted
by John H. Kellogg as saying, "I tried Fletcherism for three
months. I had to give it up—it nearly killed me."
ANCIENT FOOD FADDISTS
The weakness of following some food fad, as did Professor
James when he took up Fletcherism, is a peculiar weakness
that all too many great men have followed. It is a common
thing to find that a genius has picked up some peculiarity
and stuck to it, attributing the fact that he kept alive at all
to his eccentricity of eating. Man likes to doctor himself,
even if his doctoring is against all maxims of scientific knowl
edge or the dictates of common sense.
Old Emperor Augustus, when he was the greatest monarch
on earth, took trouble to set down in his writings the fact
that he invariably munched a crust of dry bread while bounc
ing along in his war chariot, seeking new worlds to conquer.
And the great Seneca, in one of his epistles, sets down that
he was a dry bread faddist, too, even in his old age, and
he made his evening meal on a frugal crust, sometimes eat
ing without sitting down, believing that it was better to eat
standing up.

made much of the custom of eating only one meal a day,
fasting until supper, which was a meal that came some time
after sunset. And the philosopher Locke, of the seventeenth
century, shaping his own gastronomic destiny after the man
ner of the Romans, was a fanatic for dry bread.
Herodotus of Halicarnassus, sauntering through Egypt
2,500 years ago on his original one man Cook's tour, recorded
one of the most curious of all the prehistoric fads and follies
in the history of diet. The Egyptians, wrote Herodotus, spent
three successive days of every month fasting and taking pur
gatives, believing that all poisons in the body were intro
duced through foods, and that the three days without food
were necessary to let the poisons die.
In this old Egyptian diet scheme, bread played an im
portant part, as it did in the diet of all ancient peoples. Of
late years, the faddists have tried to swing people away from
bread, and a new order has come in.
BREAD IN THE DIET
The romance of bread is a story that has been related
many times in folklore and in written history. The rhapso-
dist tells of the farmer going forth at dawn to sow the seed.
Below the soil the kernel gathers nourishment to repro
duce itself a thousand fold. The wheat lifts its stalk to the
life giving sun and rain. Men and the machines assemble
for the harvest. Transportation engineers arrange for con
veyance of the seed to the mill and carry the flour across
the world. The housewife in Scotland turns out her scones;
in France, one sees the long loaves of French bread; in Aus
tria, the Vienna loaf; in Poland, the twist, and in our own
country, the bread "untouched by human hands." Time and
again the epic of the wheat and of the soil (for the epic of
the soil is always the story of wheat) has been the theme
of novels such as Zola's Mother Earth, of Knut Hamsun's
Growth of the Soil, of Reymont's The Peasants, of Herbert
Quick's magnificent trilogy of Iowa and the Vandermark
family, and of the great story of Frank Norris, The Pit. The
story of bread carries one back constantly to the beginnings

of things. In preparing the English system of weights and
measures the pennyweight was represented by thirty-two
grains of wheat. Indeed, so fundamental was bread to life
that the term "baker's dozen" arose because of the strict
laws laid upon bakers in the giving of proper weight, so
that the careful and law-abiding members of the trade threw
in an extra loaf to assure the customer that he was receiv
ing adequate measure.
Now there was a time when a loaf of bread in these United
States was just about as standard an item as a cubist paint
ing. In those days a loaf of bread looked like bread and per
haps served its purpose satisfactorily as a vehicle for butter
or jam, but so far as its content, its texture, and its digesti
bility were concerned, it was best expressed by the letter x,
representing the unknown quantity. Indeed, young ladies
became especially famed for their ability to turn out a speci
men that would receive the approbation of the community,
and many a damsel hung a blue ribbon received at the
county fair as exhibit A in the parlor to attract prospective
marital candidates in her direction. Many a pseudohumorist
waxed wealthy on the jokes he made concerning the prod
uct turned out by newlyweds. And since those were the days
before beauty shops were as plentiful as candy stores, many
a young lady lacking comeliness qualified for the marriage
route by her culinary capacity, with special emphasis on
what she could do with flour rather than with powder.
Those days, fortunately, are gone forever. Today a loaf of
bread is as standard an item as the money that purchases it;
the money must look and feel and weigh the same piece for
piece; its ingredients must be always the same, and it must
yield a certain definite value; in the same way the loaf of
bread must have a definite weight, appearance, texture, and
taste, and must yield a definite food and body-building
value. To the physician who has to count on bread as an
article in the diet of sick and well, it means much to know
that there is a standard.

SOME FOOD FADS
THE VALUE OF FOOD
The scientific study of food has followed certain definite
trends. As early as 1840 it was recognized that proteins,
fats, carbohydrates, mineral matter, and water were the com
ponents of food tissues. Continuously thereafter chemists
were investigating constituents of food substances, and by
1895 Atwater and his associates in this country had exam
ined and listed the chemical composition of most common
foods. About this time also it became common to classify
food substances wholly by their caloric value or the amount
of energy that they would yield to the body when taken in
and properly digested. The next two decades added to this
fundamental knowledge observations concerning those mys
terious substances known as the vitamins, so that McCollum
and Davis were able in 1915 to formulate a theory of ade
quate diet. At that time they said that a diet must contain, in
addition to proteins, carbohydrates, and fats for energy, in
organic salts for the building of the body and vitamins A
and B necessary for proper growth and development. Later
additional vitamins became known, so that the alphabetical
category includes A, B, C, and D quite definitely established,
and possibly vitamin X or E necessary for reproduction.
When considering the value of any food today, we take into
account all of these various factors, and, as is obvious to
almost anyone with a fundamental knowledge of foods, no
single substance provides all of the elements necessary for
adequate nutrition. Milk is, no doubt, the most satisfactory
single article of food consumed by man, but even milk is
not a complete food when taken over a long period of time
as the sole source of nutriment. One of the troubles with
milk is that too much bulk is required to satisfy the body's
needs. It contains 87 per cent of water and 13 per cent of
dissolved substances; it happens to be rich in both calcium
and phosphorus, whereas many vegetable foods are rather
poor in these elements. Indeed, only the milk of animals
and the leafy vegetables contain enough calcium to satisfy
the needs of man. The element calcium is a most important

substance, for the human body is sensitive to changes in the
amount of calcium in the circulating blood. Quite recently
Collip, coworker with Banting in the discovery of insulin, has
found that the amount of calcium in the blood may be con
trolled by an extract made from the parathyroid glands,
which lie behind the thyroid gland in the throat. Experi
menting with this substance, he has been able to produce
remarkable changes in the body activity, merely by lowering
or increasing the amount of calcium in the blood. Milk
supplies not only calcium, but also certain proteins, fats,
and vitamins.
Wheat, and indeed all the cereal grains, seed substances,
potatoes, roots, and muscle meats lack the constituents that
are supplied by milk and the leafy vegetables. The human
being is supposed to be intelligent. It has been alleged that
the large majority of us are morons and our dietary habits
may be taken as evidence for the allegation. A moron, I
may add, lest you take the newspaper definition, is an adult
whose intellectual development stopped at the age of twelve.
There is no law of man or of nature that compels the think
ing human being to limit himself to milk, wheat, oranges,
nuts, or anything else in the food category. If he is really
intelligent he will want to make up his diet of a sufficient
variety of foods to provide everything necessary for the
proper development and stability of his tissues. He will
want to satisfy the esthetics of his appetite and the limita
tions of his digestive apparatus. Investigations have shown
that fresh fruits and certain raw vegetables ought to be in
cluded in the diet to provide adequate amounts of vitamin
C. Scientific studies have shown that the proteins of the
muscle of the liver and kidney are more valuable as a supple
ment to cereals and fats than are the proteins of milk. In
deed, it is not even certain that milk provides an adequate
amount of vitamin B, and it is known that various samples
of milk differ as to their quantities of vitamins A and C.
Eggs contain everything necessary for the growth and main
tenance of the body but are poor in calcium and unbalanced
in other food principles. On the other hand, oysters, clams,

and crabs contain all of the uncharacterized food substances,
including iodine and vitamin C. The fact that vitamin E is
present in fish oil suggests an importance for fish in the
diet diat has not been previously thought of. Vitamin E,
it must be remembered, is a help to proper reproduction and
to the avoidance of sterility. Finally, all of the natural, pri
mary food substances, such as milk, butter, fish, and what
not are not themselves standardized, but vary according
to their place of production and their environment previous
to use. This hasty review of the elemental values of some of
the well-known food substances is indicative of the im
portance of a varied diet for man. Let us see how bread, as
one of the fundamental and staple substances of human diet,
has been gradually modified through scientific education
and control to develop as nearly as possible a standard,
highly nutritious, and body-building substance.
THE VALUE OF BREAD
As was intimated in opening this discussion, the bread of
the past epoch had no definite constituents. It was made in
many instances from flour, salt, yeast, and water alone. In
other instances, it was made of the whole wheat and there
were, of course, such modifications as bread made with rye,
bread made with bran, and bread made with raisins and
other added constituents. The baker, from the mechanical
point of view alone, is not particularly desirous of prepar
ing any special form of bread. He likes to give his customers
what they want, and perhaps to approach as nearly as pos
sible what dietary experts think they ought to have. No
doubt, like all other business men, he wants to deal in a
staple product and not be subject to extensive losses by the
sudden growth of elemental and unjustifiable fads.
It was, no doubt, with this desire in mind that the bakers'
organization established its Institute of Baking, and it was,
no doubt, the same principle that urged many bakers of
large interests to establish their own chemical laboratories
for the study and standardization of their products. The re
sult has been an application of the scientific facts that have

been learned relative to modern bread. This application
caused the supplementing with milk of the bread made from
white flour, salt, yeast, and water. The addition of milk
directly to the bread rather than dependence on the house
wife to give the milk to the family at the table is well war
ranted, because economical and scientifically satisfactory.
This does not mean to say, however, that the milk added to
bread is sufficient for all dietary needs; it merely means
that a bread made with milk is a better and richer bread
than one made without it. In the same way a bread made
with raisins or other fruits provides the added constituents
of those fruits.
All breads furnish energy according to their composition.
Modern bread having a scientifically established composition
is a sensible food. It contains about 45 per cent starch and
50 per cent total carbohydrates, and its protein content aver
ages between 9 and 10 per cent. It provides limited amounts
of mineral salts, of fats, and of the vitamins, but it should
be remembered that wheat products provide 42 per cent of
the carbohydrate consumption of the United States and 26
per cent of the total calories consumed in all food substances.
As may well be imagined, a loaf of bread may vary greatly
according to the quantity and the nature of the constituents
that go into it. A bread made with white flour, yeast, salt,
malt extract, sugar, shortening, and water will not have the
food value of a bread made of the same constituents with
the addition of the amount of milk required by modern
baking standards. Our Government permits the title, "Milk
Bread," if one-third of the liquid used in making the bread
is milk. A bread made with five pounds of sweetened, con
densed milk per cental of flour contains about one and a
half ounces of milk to a pound of bread.
Bread may be made of whole wheat and other elements
of roughage and of vitamin supply that are lacking in bread
made from white flour, and it is possible to prepare bread
with wheat germ added to such an extent as to provide
twelve times the amount of wheat germ contained in whole
wheat bread. But such breads are open to certain objections

so far as texture and keeping qualities are concerned. The
physician who is prescribing bread as a part of the patient's
diet must know the constituents and character of the bread
that he prescribes.
Indeed, the situation today resembles closely the situation
that existed in the drug industry before the American Medi
cal Association appointed its Council on Pharmacy and
Chemistry, and before the Food and Drugs Act of a little
more than a decade past helped to clarify the situation. To
day, through the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, physi
cians are provided each year with a book known as "New
and Nonofficial Remedies," which gives the analyses, actions,
and uses of all of the unofficial drug products available to
the medical profession. At the same time the Council regu
larly issues reports concerning such products as are of in
definite composition or for which claims may be made that
are not warranted by the actual constituents of the drug
preparations. The variety of products offered from time to
time by baking organizations that seem to be more con
cerned with profits than with public health offers opportu
nity for similar work in the baking industry to keep both
the baker and the public informed of the actual basis on
which exploiting of nostrumlike products is based. The In
stitute of Baking has done, and is doing, much in this
direction.
BREAD FOR REDUCING
Not long since a baking organization issued, with exten
sive claims, a bread which bore the slogan "The Enemy of
Fat." Letters at once began to come to the American Medi
cal Association headquarters requesting information con
cerning this product and its actual importance as a part of
the diet of those desiring to reduce. In attempting to reply
to these questions, The Journal of the American Medical
Association sought information from the American Institute
of Baking and from the Westfield Testing and Research
Laboratories. The information revealed that the bread ad

cent of starch and a total carbohydrate content of from 36
to 40 per cent, whereas ordinary bread contained only some
45 per cent of starch and 50 per cent of total carbohydrates.
Moreover, the bread for the obese contained 18 per cent of
protein as compared with 9 or 10 per cent in ordinary
bread. Clearly, from these analyses, the bread mentioned
had no special value in a diet for those desiring to reduce.
Any woman who would eat a smaller amount of ordinary
White bread or the same amount of ordinary whole wheat
bread and who would follow the rigid diet recommended in
each package of the bread with special claims as to value in
obesity would be able to reduce just as rapidly and at less
expense. These observations caused the Institute of Baking
to make the statement that the claims made for weight re
ducing breads were misleading and exaggerated. The Jour
nal of the American Medical Association supported the Bak
ing Institute with all its force of influence and publicity in
its exposure of this quackery.
WHOLE WHEAT
The very fact that wheat and bread are fundamental sub
stances in the diet of man has made the exploitation of
cereal products and of bread an attractive field for the ex
ploiter. This, too, has influenced the manufacture of numer
ous whole wheat products, for which claims are made that
go far beyond scientific fact. Indeed, the false and ful
some advertising has been so potent that even a circular just
issued by the Children's Bureau of the United States Gov
ernment advises the pregnant woman and the nursing
mother to limit their diet of bread and cereals to whole
grain because of the high mineral and vitamin content.
Let us consider first the manner in which it has been
endeavored to relate the consumption of white flour to the
cause of cancer. It is a significant observation in medical
history that the advancing of numerous and peculiar theories
is a good indication of the lack of any accurate knowledge as
to the cause of disease, just as a multiplicity of methods of
treatment is a reflection of a similar state of affairs. Fortu

nately sufficient is known about cancer to warrant the ad
vice that it be treated primarily by early diagnosis and sur
gical removal, with possible application of radium or X-ray
for such purposes as may be accomplished with these meth
ods. The world was surprised not long since by the an
nouncement of the discovery of a new bacterial organism as
the cause of cancer. For the past fifteen years the discovery of
some bacterial organism associated with cancer has been an
annual event. During that same period hardly a month has
passed by but what the editor of The Journal of the Ameri
can Medical Association has had submitted to him manu
scripts advancing new theories as to the cause of this malig
nant condition, and not the least among these theories have
been those associated with dietary fallacies. In England the
exploiters of this peculiar idea have been such men as the sur
geon, Arbuthnot Lane, and the publicist, J. E. Barker. In
deed, even Sir Clifford Allbutt before his death was drawn
into the controversy in the support of whole wheat bread as
contrasted with that made from white flour. It was Sir Clif
ford Allbutt's view that the whole wheat flour was richer, that
it had a more agreeable flavor than the white loaf, which he
said was insipid, and that the vitamins are illusive and must
be sought in the whole grain. Once this view was advanced,
others came to its support, and medical health officers and
general practitioners did not hesitate to advance their opin
ions. Arbuthnot Lane committed himself some years ago
to the view that most of the ills of mankind are caused by
intestinal stasis or constipation. He urged the use of whole
wheat bread to relieve constipation and he short circuited
the intestines and removed their kinks as a quick surgical
road to the relief sought. It was a witty American surgeon
who commented: "It's a long lane that has no kink."
As might have been expected, it was not long before the
British hyperenthusiasm infected the United States. Among
the first to seize upon this conception for journalistic exploi
tation was the organ of that most erudite of automobile
manufacturers, Mr. Henry Ford. The man, who found diffi

Bennett, did not hesitate, through the periodical that he
sponsors, to support the view that the eating of white flour
bread is responsible for cancer. There was about as much
actual knowledge behind the latter opinion as behind the
former. There is not an iota of scientific evidence that the
eating of white bread, or any other kind of bread, will cause
cancer, and not the slightest reason to believe that the use
of whole wheat bread will in any way prevent it.
Before making a definite statement as to the actual value
of white flour bread as contrasted with whole wheat, it
should be emphasized again that neither white flour bread
nor whole wheat bread constitutes a single article in diet for
any intelligent person. As pointed out by McCollum, there
are many reasons why the American can eat white flour
bread satisfactorily. "White flour," he says, "keeps much
better than whole wheat flour, and so can be handled with
less commercial hazard. The American public likes white
flour bread, and I do not see any reason," he continues,
"why this taste should be disturbed. The important thing is
to insist upon the consumption of a sufficient amount of
what I have termed the protective foods —milk and vege
tables of the leafy type —to insure that calcium deficiency,
and the vitamin deficiency of white bread will be made
good." If baking technologic research is able to incorporate
larger amounts of milk solids in the loaf of bread or other
wise to insure a sufficient amount of calcium and the im
portant vitamins, even this charge cannot rest against white
flour bread.
The supporters of whole wheat as against white flour for
dietary purposes argue that the human bowel requires a cer
tain amount of roughage in order to exercise its functions
satisfactorily. This point must not be considered without
reference to the varying conditions that may exist in dif
ferent individuals. Dr. W. C. Alvarez of the Hooper Foun

happen to have congenitally defective or handicapped diges
tive tracts; if they have ulcers or narrow places, they cannot
handle the mass of indigestible material, and they promptly
get into trouble." Many other dietary substances such as
celery, lettuce, spinach, and raisins provide roughage. Why
ask bread to be like Messalina—all things to all men? It is
for the individual physician, knowing the condition of the
intestinal tract of the person with whom he is especially
concerned, to determine whether or not that person ought
to use breads or other foods that depart from the standard
product or from the normal diet. For those who do not
have such special recommendation, the standard white bread
loaf, that forms the large portion of bread baked in the
United States today, is the product to be recommended as
most satisfactory.
We are a people singularly cursed with faddists. We have
educational cults, healing cults, religious cults, and heaven
alone knows how many peculiar promotional systems. We
have dietary faddists who believe that the eating of more
white bread, more wheat, more fruit, or more raisins is nec
essary to healthful living. The time has arrived for calling a
halt to the growing procession of slogans that tend to pro
mote panaceas for health and well-being. We are admonished
at every turn to eat more bread, to drink more milk, to buy
more raisins, to consume more apples, to confine ourselves
to whole wheat, to try some bran, or to add one or another
of a dozen different items to our daily regimen. Many per
sons have a limited tolerance for a food like raisins, and the
victim of chronic inflammation of the intestines may hesi
tate to secure his iron through a "mixture of sugar and
skins" as one caustic commentator characterized this con
fection.
The starchy foods —wheat, corn, rice, and potatoes —
are universal sources of food for the body. Bread, the very
staff of life, gives that feeling of satisfaction following eating
that is an important factor in a suitable diet. One should
not urge the sedentary, the desk-ridden, or any other mus

cularly inactive person to eat more meat or more wheat 01
to increase his bread supply. Americans today tend more
and more to suffer with obesity or overweight. It is the
opinion of those best informed that overweight is one of the
most important factors in shortening the span of human
life. Physiologists have established the fact that a meal com
posed largely of cereals is passed through the stomach within
one and a half hours, whereas the inclusion of meat will pro
long the time two or three hours. In recommending a diet
of cereals and starchy foods as compared with meats, fats,
and cheese, these things must be taken into account by the
physician.
The scientific physician welcomes the establishment of a
standard loaf of bread made according to the best scientific
evidence as to what is demanded in bread by the taste of
the public and by our knowledge of nutrition and of the
mysterious vitamins. Such a product can be included in
diets both for the sick and for the well with a clear under
standing of the effect that it may have on digestion and
growth. The physician opposes the promotion of any single
article of diet according to "the all or nothing policy" as
the one substance important to health or the control of
disease. In efforts at education of the public, which the
modern physician believes is the most important factor in
lengthening the span of life, faddist notions must be at
tacked with all the vigor and influence that the scientific
pen can command either by purchase of advertising space
or by the contribution of articles published for the public
good. The time is near at hand when the compliment given
by Don Quixote to a knight of his acquaintance may be
used without fear of attack from any meticulous critic. The
Don remarked to his squire, Sancho Panza: "He is as good
as good bread." Man does not live, however, on bread alone.
The important thing is the consumption of a sufficient
amount of all good substances to insure that the deficiency
of minerals and of vitamins, and of other important con
stituents is fully supplied.

SOME FOOD FADS
DANGEROUS FOOD COMBINATIONS
The most recent idea exploited commercially by food fad
dists is the dangerous food combination theory. Recently
Dr. Agnes Fay Morgan, chairman of the department of
household science in the University of California, discussed
this subject. The food faddists claim that some combinations
are deficient because they leave out important substances;
but most frequently they claim that combinations of acid
foods such as fruits, along with starches such as bread and
potatoes, are unwise because the acid will prevent the diges
tion of the starch. Such a statement can only come from com
plete ignorance of the process of digestion. Actually there
are digestive ferments for starches released far down in the
intestines.
The same faddists will claim that proteins and starchy
food must not be eaten together, notwithstanding the fact
that at least five generations of Americans have been reared
on a diet consisting mainly of meat and potatoes. Faddists
claim that milk and fruit acids must not be eaten together,
because the acids curdle the milk. Who would care to give
up strawberries or raspberries and cream? One need not do
so! Just as soon as the milk reaches the stomach it comes
into contact with a secretion that is largely acid. Many physi
cians who take care of babies advise the addition of acid to
the milk fed to the infants because they believe that it helps
their digestion.
There is no more evidence that excessive alkalinity is
desirable for the human body than excessive acidity. Physiol
ogists have learned to appreciate the fact that the tissues
have a certain normal acidity and alkalinity and that the
patient is best served by maintaining the normal under most
conditions. The human body is provided with factors of
safety in its functioning and tends to adjust itself. Food
faddists constantly strive to break down the normal borders.

FADS AND QUACKERY IN HEALING
THE VEGETARIANS
The vegetarians believe that meat is a dangerous poison,
that it creates rheumatism and gout, that meat is dangerous
because it is full of germs. They reason wholly by analogy,
claiming that the eating of meat makes a person savage. All
of us know better than that. A friend of mine sat opposite
a vegetarian in a restaurant. My friend was a great lover of
steaks and ordered a large one. A fanatic in the health field
likes to tell everybody else about his particular notions. The
cold bath fanatic comes into his office, or his schoolroom,
or any other place, and announces to the world that he had
his cold bath that morning. Perhaps it was necessary for
him to break the ice to get that cold bath, and if he has to
break the ice it makes it all the more important. The cold
bath fanatic believes that to take a cold bath in the morn
ing is the perfect road to health. He wonders audibly why
you are such a weakling that you do not take a cold bath.
Your only pleasure comes when he comes down with pneu
monia and you can say, "I told you so."
The vegetarian fanatic is of the same type. This vegetarian
looked over at my friend as he began to masticate his ten
derloin steak, and he said, "I never eat meat." He said that
"I never eat meat" as though he was flinging the flag of de
fiance in my friend's face. "And beside," he continued, "I'm
an antivivisectionist. I never harm a lower animal."
My friend said, "You may not eat meat, brother, but you
are going to feel like hell when you hear that you just ate
a big caterpillar with that lettuce you're working on."
Just why anyone becomes a vegetarian has never been
certainly established. In some instances it seems to be merely
a desire to be different from the majority. On the other
hand, some people are so sensitive regarding the sight of
flesh or blood that they simply cannot eat meat because they
see it exposed in the butcher shop. Other vegetarians are
actually so concerned about pain caused to the lower ani
mals that they avoid animal food for that reason. Vegetarians

eat milk, eggs, and cheese which, of course, are animal prod
ucts as much as the flesh of the animal.
Dr. Adolphe Abrahams of the Westminster Hospital in
London points out that the intestinal tract of man is in
capable of manipulating a sufficient amount of vegetable
material to insure receipt of the caloric value needed for
good health. If, however, cheese, eggs, and milk are in
cluded, the minimum amount can be had. On the other
hand, there is plenty of evidence that meat protein is supe
rior for tissue building to vegetable protein, regardless of
caloric value. An occasional vegetarian distinguishes himself
as an athlete or strong man. This does not prove that every
one who is a vegetarian will be an athlete nor does it indi
cate in the slightest that other athletes will do well on a
similar diet.
There are plenty of notions regarding the training of
athletes that have never been established scientifically. One
recent writer on athletics has suggested that long distance
runners eat such things as will give power of endurance and
increased nerve force, and that hammer throwers take food
and liquids which would make flesh and bone. Such state
ments are absurd; there are no such foods with such specific
qualities. In the older days of the time of John L. Sullivan,
athletes never kept in training, but immediately after a
match dropped all restrictions and took vast quantities of
beer and meats and put on weight. It, therefore, became
necessary for them on going into training to adopt the most
rigid of diets. This brought about the notion that certain
foods were not suitable for athletes.
The argument has been made that the modern sophisti
cated diet of man leads to gastric ulcer, cancer, Bright's
disease, and similar disturbances. Recently a study was made
of two native tribes —the Kikiyu and the Masai. The Kikiyu
live entirely on vegetables; the Masai eat meat, blood, and
milk. Neither of these savage tribes averages the European
height, but the average height of the meat eater is five inches
more than that of the vegetable eaters, and their strength
is 50 per cent greater. It was found, furthermore, that gas

trie ulcer, rickets, and practically every disease, except in
testinal obstruction, was more frequent among the vegetable
eaters than among the meat eating tribe.
There is another reason why people who eat a balanced
diet are really the normal people! They are happy. The
average man who lives on a one-track system is not usually
happy. He is constantly distressed with an interior craving.
A person whose mind is on his appetite is not a pleasant
person to meet. The really pleasant people are the people
who have just finished a good dinner, and who have all the
happy feelings that come with a good meal.
EAT MORE CAMPAIGNS
The "eat more campaigns" are of the greatest interest
to all of us because they represent the spread in the field of
nutrition of what is known as propaganda or advertising.
American opinion today is made largely by advertising.
More people read advertising than read anything else. The
advertising writers are paid higher rates than are paid to
the finest writers of literature. The advertising artists are
paid higher rates than are paid to the artists who draw the
finest landscapes or pictures. The greatest incomes given in
this country today are given to people who have the power
to convince other people of the value of certain articles.
Advertising has come into the scientific field of nutrition,
and people are taught by advertising to eat for health rea
sons.
The advertiser recognized, even before the National Edu
cation Association, the fact that people are primarily inter
ested in health. Without health there can be no happiness.
Without health there can be no financial success. Health is
fundamental to everything that is important in life.
The first "eat more campaign" was the campaign to eat
more raisins. Now there are various uses for raisins—as has
become widely known since the coming of prohibition. The
advertiser, who was selling raisins on the basis of the health
appeal, made his appeal on the ground that raisins give
iron. A certain amount of iron is necessary in the human

system, but the amount of iron that is necessary for the
average man in health is not a great deal.
It has been shown at the University of Rochester in New
York by experiments on animals that the amount of iron
needed by the average man in order to take care of his regu
lar iron interchange each day is a few milligrams per day.
That is not a great deal of iron. That would be about as
much iron as one could get by sucking hard on a rusty nail.
People began buying little packages of raisins and eating
two or three or four packages of raisins per day. They filled
their interiors with seeds and stems and peel and began
developing irritations of the stomach and intestinal tract.
The "eat more raisins campaign" gradually disappeared.
Then came the campaigns to eat more pineapples, more
oranges, more this, more that, and more of everything.
THE VITAMINS
The wise man of today eats a widely varied diet. He recog
nizes that there are all sorts of food substances which go to
make up a balanced diet. He recognizes that one has to eat
certain quantities of proteins of various types, carbohydrates,
and fats, mineral salts, a certain amount of cellulose to rep
resent the ash, and the roughage that is necessary in the
diet. He recognizes the importance of the mineral salts,
such as iodine, calcium, phosphorus, and iron, and he recog
nizes the necessity for the vitamins—A, B, C, D, E, and as
far up as you can go with actual knowledge.
A teacher asked a little boy one time to write an essay.
He was a little doubtful what to write about. She said, "Just
write what is in you." He gave it a great deal of thought and
finally he wrote, "In me there is an all-day sucker, my cereal,
stomach, liver, and lungs, and the bowels, which are a, e, i,
o, and u, and sometimes y and w." Most people know just
about that much concerning the vitamins.
We must consider the vitamin, not only in its relation to
complete deprivation, but also as to the value of small
amounts in all diets. We know if a child or an animal, such
as a white rat, is deprived completely of vitamin A. that

with respiratory disease and other types of infection. If de
prived of vitamin B, its appetite and digestion suffer. If
you deprive it of vitamin C, it is likely to get scurvy. If you
deprive it of vitamin D, it develops rickets, and if you de
prive it of vitamin E, it will lose the power of reproduction.
Those are the end results of the deprivation of vitamins,
but we have not yet come to the point where we actually
know the results of vitamin deficiency in small amounts—
of relative vitamin deficiency. This must concern the stu
dents of the science of nutrition for the near future —the
question of what happens when a person is deprived of rela
tively large amounts of the vitamins, but still gets some. We
are going to find that when we apply all of the knowledge
that we now have on nutrition we are going to be able to
make a better type of human being than exists upon the
world today.
DRUGS AND FOOD IN MEDICINE
The evolution of therapeutics constitutes one of the most
interesting chapters in the history of medicine. The magi
cal formulas and the therapy based on analogy, which were
the basis of medical treatment before the time of Hippoc
rates, gave way to the intelligent use of physical therapy and
the treatment based on scientific observation, which were
the distinguishing characteristics of the Hippocratic school.
The didacticism of Galen, which dominated medicine for
some eight hundred years, must be considered the basis of
the therapy by fixed formulas and shotgun prescriptions,
which yielded only with the advent of scientific pharmacol
ogy and with the development of the work of the Council
on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical As
sociation.
Although not completely successful, the efforts of this
Council have made a distinct impression on American ther
apy, and the results of its work will be even more apparent
in a coming generation than they are today. It must be
borne in mind that the work of the Council on Pharmacy

and Chemistry began coincidentally with the work of the
Council on Medical Education and Hospitals. The gradu
ates of the 170 medical colleges, which have been reduced
to the 70 class A schools of today, still practice among us.
These graduates constitute the group to whom some fifty
manufacturers of fixed formulas and unscientific prepara
tions appeal.
The development of our scientific knowledge of foods is
much more recent than such knowledge as we possess con
cerning the actions of drugs. All of us can remember when
the only reason foods were taken was their caloric value.
We can remember the period when it was first realized that
foods contain proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and mineral
salts. We can remember the time when it began to be real
ized that there was more than one kind of protein. We can
remember particularly the first announcements of the dis
covery of vitamins and the subsequent exploitation of this
knowledge. Whenever a new discovery is made in the field
of science, commercial exploiters are ready to adapt that
discovery for their personal gain. The furor associated with
the discovery of the vitamins has made the word itself one
with which to conjure. The spring tonic of the past contain
ing sulphur and molasses, the iron, quinine, and strychnine
which has been for years the staple tonic of the dispensaries,
and even such patent medicine tonics as depended primarily
on old John Barleycorn for the impetus which they gave to
a sluggish circulation and a lassitudinous mind have given
way to the vitamin tonic and the health food.
Notwithstanding the lack of exact information on which
to make definite claims for various natural as well as syn
thetic food products, both the medical profession and the
public have been deluged with screaming announcements
concerning the health-giving qualities of such preparations.
Foods are sold as health foods, as tonic foods, and as vitaliz
ing foods. This was the situation that caused the Council on
Pharmacy and Chemistry to ask of the Board of Trustees
the permission to appoint a Committee on Foods, which
should serve in relationship to food products in the same

way that the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry concerned
itself with drug products. The personnel of the committee
as first established included representatives in the fields of
internal medicine, pediatrics, and biochemistry. The work
has been strenuous, indeed so time-consuming and difficult
as to cast a severe burden on those who have given of them
selves for the benefit of the public. From time to time some
of those originally on the Committee have been compelled
to resign, but their places have been taken by others who
have carried on continuously for almost two years.
One of the significant requirements of the Committee
on Foods is to demand that any food product comply with
the requirements of the Food and Drug Administration and
of state regulating bodies concerned with foods. All of these
have given to the Committee the highest type of cooperation
in questions which have arisen and have thus made far
simpler the work of both the Committee and the manufac
turers who cooperate.
Every one is familiar with the great rise in the use of
chocolate drinks and cocoa. Malted milk has become the
staple luncheon of innumerable workers. The claims made
for certain glorified malted milks indicate that their man
agers conceive them to be panaceas for mankind. For years,
tea and coffee have been forbidden to children on the
grounds that the caffeine which they contain would over-
stimulate the child and that such drinks tended to take the
place of milk and of more nutritious beverages in the child's
diet. There has been a well defined impression that choco
late and cocoa should not be forbidden to children, notwith
standing the fact that these also contain theobromine. One
of the general decisions adopted by the Committee says:
No special health claims for chocolate (plain chocolate,
bitter chocolate, chocolate liquor, or chocolate paste) , cocoa
or products consisting in considerable part of chocolate or
cocoa are permissible for children. No objection may be
taken to health claims for foods merely chocolate flavored
and which as consumed in probable maximum quantity are
free from any probable caffeine or theobromine effect, pro

vided that health claims are permissible for the basic foods
themselves.
Gelatin as a dessert and as a food substance for the invalid
has attained wide vogue in recent years. It has been repeat
edly urged that milk fed to the infant can be made more
digestible by the addition of gelatin. A careful review of
the available evidence caused the Committee to adopt the
decision that gelatin cannot be considered an aid to the
digestibility of milk or milk products.
It has been taken for granted by many physicians, as well
as by the public, that one tomato juice was like another
and that there was little, if any, choice among such prod
ucts. However, investigation of the methods of preparation
of tomato juices indicated that some of the methods were
much more destructive of the vitamin content than others.
Hence the Committee adopted the decision that an accepted
canned tomato juice must have a vitamin content practically
equivalent to that of the raw tomato juice used, excepting
that juice with materially reduced vitamin content may be
accepted if the label and advertising plainly declare the
tested potency as compared with that of the raw juice.
Another type of product that has had great vogue in re
cent years has been strained vegetables especially recom
mended for infants, children, convalescents, and special
diets. The reason for this recommendation is the fact that
the fiber of the vegetable is comminuted by the process,
and in that way it is more easily handled by the digestive
tract. Here again the Committee was concerned not only
with the question of the vitamin content but also with the
question as to whether or not the prepared product was as
rich in mineral salts as the original vegetables. On these
questions, the Committee has adopted several general deci
sions:
An accepted canned, strained, or sieved vegetable spe
cially prepared for infants, children, convalescents, and spe
cial diets shall have a vitamin content practically equivalent
to that of the raw vegetable or vegetables used or in so far

as is possible to obtain by the most modern and efficient
manufacturing methods for the protection of vitamins, ex
cepting that such special vegetable products with materially
impaired vitamin content may be accepted, however, only
on proper and prominent declaration on the label and in
advertising of the experimentally determined vitamin con
tent relative to that of the raw material used.
An accepted canned, strained, or sieved vegetable espe
cially prepared for infants, children, convalescents and special

that of the raw vegetable or vegetables used or in so far as

ever, only on proper and prominent declaration on the label

In considering canned, strained, or sieved fruits for in
fants, it was found that fruits are commonly bleached with
sulphur dioxide. The question of possible harmfulness of
this procedure was carefully considered. The Committee
ruled:
No objection will be taken to the presence of small quan
tities of added sulphur dioxide in vegetable or fruit products
especially prepared for infants.
For several years the public has been besieged with the
claims made for products containing various amounts of
bran and cellulose. It has been argued that such foods are
healthful in that they overcome constipation and relieve
the associated symptoms. On the other hand, competent
gastroenterologists are convinced that too much roughage in
the diet will irritate the gastro-intestinal tract, and that its
use may be exceedingly harmful in cases of ulcer of the stom
ach or duodenum and in cases of colitis.
The introduction of processes of irradiation of various

have not been established. Fortunately, it is well known
that there is a considerable factor of safety and that the
toxic dose is hundreds or even thousands of times beyond
the necessary dosage of such substance. The irradiation of
foods has been advanced as a special quality to increase their
sale and use. It has been suggested that the amount of vita
min D developed in some irradiated cereals is so slight that
an infant would be required to eat four pounds of cereal
daily to get the equivalent of a normal dosage of cod liver
oil. In passing on irradiated foods, the Committee has urged
that manufacturers place on the package statements of equi
valents to cod liver oil in vitamin D, to carrots in vitamin
A, to orange juice in vitamin C, and to yeast in vitamin B,
so that the purchaser or the physician who prescribes the
foods may have a more adequate conception of what is be
ing supplied.
The Committee has deprecated the irradiation of milk on
the grounds that this basic food substance might best be
undisturbed. On the other hand, it has recently passed an
irradiated bread, since this stable substance in the diet has
been attacked as being deficient in many essential substances.
It is realized, of course, that the knowledge concerning
vitamins, as well as the application of this knowledge itself
to daily life, is in an exceedingly early experimental stage.
Fortunately, the possibility of harm attached to the con
sumption of such products is not nearly so great as would
be the misguided use of therapeutic medicaments.
The American people are given to all or nothing policies
in what they do for health. If they are told that the con
sumption of a certain amount of orange juice is healthful
because it provides vitamin C and tends to overcome aci
dosis, they are likely to drink so much orange juice as to
upset the digestion and to make impossible the taking of
additional necessary good substances. If they are told that
vitamins are healthful, they buy anything for which a vita
min claim may be made. It must be realized that the human
being can take not more than 6,000 calories a day, that the
average man eats 4,000, and that probably 3,000 are suffi

cient. These must include all the necessary food substances,
and it is safe to say that the essentials will be taken in the
vast majority of cases by any one who eats a well balanced
diet, including meats, fruits, cereals, vegetables, milk, and
eggs.
The diction of the advertiser of food is purposefully ex
travagant in order that he may the better influence the group
to which he is appealing. The purpose of the Committee on
Foods is to have the labels of food products clear as to the
nature of the product advertised and its composition. The
Committee refuses to accept any product that is advertised as
a health food or as a tonic food. It deprecates the claim of
sterility, unless the terms "sterile" and "sterilized," as ap
plied to foods, are used with their strict scientific significance
and implication only.
The Committee on Foods was created to prevent or dis
courage unwarranted, incorrect or false advertising claims
in the promotion of food products and thus to protect the
public and the medical profession against deception by un
truthful or fraudulent health, nutritional, or other advertis
ing claims for food. It is recognized that the advertising of
foods is a regular practice of food merchandising and that
truthful food advertising is attractive to the public. It pro
vides them with statements concerning food values and
proper nutrition, and aids in the dissemination of much
helpful information. Incorrect or fraudulent food adver
tising, on the other hand, in proportion to its degree of in
correctness and falsity, is capable of working harm in mat
ters of health.

WHAT AMERICA DRINKS
"Pure water is the best of drinks
The temperance poet sings
But who am I that I should have
The very best of things?
Let dukes go freely to the pump
Let princes sip their tea
Whisky or beer or even wine
Is good enough for me."
—Anon.
The
human being can live around forty days without food,
around four days without water, and around five or six
minutes without air. Water is thus the second most im
portant substance taken into the human body. Moreover,
one-half of every solid food taken into the body is water.
The necessity for water lies in the fact that it enters into
every chemical reaction that takes place in the human body,
that it is of importance in regulating the temperature of the
body and, indeed, that 100 pounds out of the body weight of
an average adult human being is water.
The extent to which water is utilized is obvious from the
fact that the body gets rid of at least an ounce of water
every hour without any realization of the fact that the water
is disappearing, this loss taking place in the way of insen
sible perspiration. The total amount of water lost through
insensible perspiration is about a pint and a half a day. In
times when the human being is subjected to considerable
heat, such as occurs in a ride in an open car under the Cali
fornia sun, as much as 10 quarts of water may be taken into
the body and evaporated from it in a few hours.

It is not surprising, then, that thirst should constitute one
of the most fundamental of human sensations and that its
relief should be a major desire associated with the three
other fundamental desires of mankind, the satisfaction of
the sense of hunger, the satisfaction of the desire for propa
gation, and the selection of a spiritual belief as a prop on
which to lean in times of doubt.
Throughout the world men vary in the manner in which
they assuage their cravings for fluids. The popularity of
beer in England, of wine in Italy and France, and of certain
beers and wines in Germany and Austria is proverbial. For
those who prefer their beverages without too much added
stimulation there remain tea and coffee.
COFFEE
The American has a consumption of coffee approximating
12 pounds per capita annually as contrasted with less than
one pound for the Englishman, whereas the Englishman's
consumption of tea is in inverse ratio to the coffee require
ment. Milk, long considered the most important individual
food substance, is universally used, but seldom does the par
taker realize that it is approximately 90 per cent water.
Other beverages temporarily replace in popularity those
that have been mentioned. When William Jennings Bryan
became the standard bearer for grape juice, the manufac
turers of that beverage profited amazingly. Buttermilk, time
and again, has put forth a spurt, but fairly soon its appeal
to the appetite lags, and some other fluid concoction comes
to the front.
In the southern portions of the United States vast amounts
of flavored syrups mixed with carbonated water are imbibed.
Such drinks as Coca Cola are dependent for such stimulation
as they develop on a small content of caffeine, the active
ingredient of coffee.
In the more northern portions of the United States, the
soda fountains do a thriving business in malted concoctions

of sugary taste which cloy the appetite and thus save the
hard earned shekels of the stenographers, permitting them
to purchase cosmetics instead of food.
The popularity of any beverage may be built up by a
sufficient amount of money spent in advertising with a suit
able psychological appeal.
MALTED AND CHOCOLATE DRINKS
Conspicuous among American beverages are food drinks
claimed to control nervous breakdowns, to induce prompt
sleep, to relieve stomach disorders and feeble digestion, to
restore the tired worker, and to act specifically as nerve
foods. These mixtures are essentially concentrated extracts
of malted milk and eggs flavored with cocoa or chocolate.
Thousands of Uncle Sam's citizenry still believe that certain
substances taken into the stomach go directly to certain
organs, giving them nourishment and stimulating them to
the height of activity.
The strange notion that any substance taken into the stom
ach will be selected by the blood and carried directly to the
nerves or the brain and thereby induce alertness, intelli
gence, and extraordinary mental perspicacity is completely
fantastic. The claims that a mixture of milk, malt, eggs, and
cocoa will induce prompt, natural sleep in severe cases of
insomnia is merely taking advantage of the power of sugges
tion and of a lack of physiological knowledge in the group
to whom the appeal is made.
Doctors know that any warm drink taken at night will
help to assuage restlessness. Indeed, application of the warm
fluid to the outside of the body in the form of a warm bath
is probably preferable to the effects of warmths derived by
taking the fluid internally. Such an effect is all that can be
expected of such mixtures.
The Food and Drug Administration of the United States
Department of Agriculture has issued certain definitions
which should be more widely known to those who indulge
in beverages of various types—and who does not?

GINGER ALE AND CARBONATED WATERS
The most common dilutent of more potent beverages is
ginger ale and mineral waters. Ginger ale is a carbonated
beverage prepared from ginger ale flavor, harmless organic
acid, potable waters and a syrup containing sugar, invert
sugar or dextrose, with or without the addition of caramel
flavor.
Carbonated waters are merely effervescent drinks prepared
by charging ordinary water with carbon dioxide. Sometimes
the carbonated waters are made from natural mineral waters
obtained from various springs and containing, therefore,
varying but small amounts of calcium, sulphur, phosphorus,
iron, magnesium, and other mineral salts.
Root beers were formerly brewed from sweetened infu
sions of various roots and herbs, the gas being formed by
true fermentation processes. Nowadays, such drinks are
manufactured by processes which involve mixing of the
herbs and subsequent carbonation.
One of the most popular root beers includes caramel,
sassafras, sarsaparilla, licorice and ginger roots, birch bark,
hops, spikenard and pipsissewa herbs, vanilla beans, and
wintergreen leaves. These materials are ground in a mill,
the ground product extracted with boiling water under pres
sure, caramel added, and the mixture bottled from auto
matic filling machines. These ingredients are utterly with
out medicinal value, notwithstanding the fact that for years
sarsaparilla was a popular spring tonic.
SODA WATER
The soda waters flavored with fruit syrups are merely car
bonated beverages prepared with flavors consisting of fruit
juices and sugar, sterilized by heating and put up in bottles,
sometimes sweetened with glucose, sometimes colored with
artificial dyes and preserved with antiseptics.
Not infrequently citric or tartaric acid is added to real
fruit syrups to bring out the flavor, and to imitation fruit
syrups in order to help them to imitate the desired product.

WHAT AMERICA DRINKS
In more recent years orange juice and grapefruit juice
have supplemented the juice of the lemon and of the lime
in providing citrus fruit drinks. The chief advantages of
citrus fruits are their content of vitamin C, the antiscurvy
vitamin, and their tendency toward an ultimate alkaline re
action in the body.
Such an alkaline reaction is, of course, provided by any
carbonated beverage. There is not, however, in any of the
citrus fruits any miraculous principle that will yield eternal
youth or that will quite certainly prevent the occurrence of
the common cold.
Food fanatics, nevertheless, swill vast amounts of orange
juice or products prepared from mixtures of the pulp and
of the peel, in the belief that they are thereby building
themselves up physically, since many of them have already
broken down mentally. The orange juice combined with gin
in various mixtures is employed wholly as a flavor and those
who take it in this form are not concerned with vitamins.
Apparently the human body must have its fluids. The
manner in which it gets the fluid is, after all, of little im
portance. If grape juice, malted milks, or root beer appeal
to the appetite, there is no reason why water should not be
taken in this manner, provided the sweet character of the
beverage is not such as to ruin one's desire for necessary
foods and deprive the body of nourishment.
If the pleasant tingle of ginger ale or carbonated water
appeals to the palate, one may indulge in these beverages
to the complete assuagement of thirst without fear of harm
ful consequence, and with a subsequent reaction limited
quite definitely by the amounts of more potent preparations
with which these basic products have been modified.
ALCOHOLIC DRINKS
And it has not yet been proved that the taking of lightly
alcoholic beverages, in moderation, in any way shortens
human life. However, the value of alcoholic drinks in the
prevention of coughs, colds, influenza, and the like has prob
ably been overestimated. Whisky may relieve a patient from

pain and depression; but it will not prevent pneumonia,
and according to some medical authorities, it will even make
the likelihood of pneumonia greater. Statistics fail to show
that it has cut down the influenza death rate appreciably.
In 1925, Dr. Roger I. Lee read before the annual session
of the American Medical Association his views as to the use
of alcohol in medical practice. He pointed out that unques
tionably the form of alcohol given has a distinct effect on
the organs of taste and smell, and the form and dilution
have a definite effect on the ease with which the drug is
tolerated by the stomach. The great vogue of alcohol in the
past was for the treatment of acute infections. It was no
ticed, for instance, that in such infections large amounts
of alcohol could be tolerated without alcoholic intoxication,
that the drug acted as a food tending to spare the tissues
of the body, and that it possibly facilitated the retention of
fluids in the body, a matter of great importance in fevers, in
which the loss of water is great and serious.
Without regard to these factors, however, Dr. Lee finds a
certain definite use for alcohol or for alcoholic liquors in
the treatment of disease. "The usual immediate effect of
alcohol in human beings," he says, "is the creation of the
state of artificial euphoria."
The conspicuous example cited by Dr. Lee is one that has
been cited to me by numerous great clinicians throughout
the United States. "An elderly patient, for example, is con
valescent from a mild upper respiratory infection, whether
we call it a cold, the grip, influenza, bronchitis, or bronchial
pneumonia. In the convalescence, the weight of years hangs
heavily on the patient. He is conscious of many mild func
tional disturbances; he is depressed and miserable in mind
and body; he is without appetite, and has a sense of prostra
tion and weakness. To be sure, much can be done for this
patient by careful nursing, tonics, and the various so-called
volatile stimulants. Nevertheless, the exhibition of alcohol
in some agreeable form eases the miseries of his body, en
courages him to eat, and helps in the establishment of re
covery."

WHAT AMERICA DRINKS
"There are occasional cases in the early stage of pulmo
nary tuberculosis," Dr. Lee says, "when the little fever, the
distress of body, and the consciousness of this dread malady
make life appear drab, and the judicious administration of
alcohol in small amounts seems to alter the gloomy outlook
on life and to make endurable the rigors of the necessary
regimen."
As for heart disease, here too Dr. Lee finds a use for alco
hol, particularly in the patient with chronic disease of the
organ that will no longer respond to the drugs used. The
patient is worried and distressed. He sees constantly before
him impending death. Such a patient "often finds more com
fort from alcohol judiciously given in moderate doses than
from opiates, which are better reserved for a future period."
Alcohol is probably never directly life-saving. That term
must be reserved for such effects as are brought about by
diphtheria or scarlet fever antitoxins, by digitalis, by salvar-
san, by quinine, or by other remedies with specific action on
the organisms that cause disease.
In most of the textbooks on the uses of drugs there is
specific mention of the use of alcohol in medicine as a food.
The Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American
Medical Association —a body composed of some seventeen
practicing clinicians, specialists in the diseases of children,
chemists, pharmacologists, bacteriologists, and others —has
prepared for the use of teachers of materia medica and thera
peutics a book called Useful Drugs. This volume aims to
select from the thousands of remedies in the United States
Pharmacopoeia and the National Formulary those drugs and
preparations of greatest usefulness to the practicing
physician.
In this book it is pointed out that alcohol is used exter
nally to harden and cleanse the skin. Its astringent action
permits it to serve as a mild counterirritant, and the fact
that it is strongly antiseptic in concentrations of 70 per cent
gives it high usefulness in surgery. Internally, according to
Useful Drugs, "it is a narcotic, excessive doses depressing
and paralyzing the central nervous system. Small doses pro

duce euphoria, stimulate respiration, moderately dilate the
cutaneous and splanchnic vessels, and modify the circula
tion. It is burned in the body and thus serves to a restricted
extent as a source of energy." "In well selected cases," says
this guide, "especially in patients accustomed to its use, it
may be very valuable; otherwise it is apt to do more harm
than good."
The chief use of alcohol as a food or as a source of energy
has been in diabetes. Since it is not nitrogenous it cannot
replace protein substances that are broken down in the body,
and it cannot replace insulin in the burning of sugar. It may
act as a substitute for some of the carbohydrates in the body,
however, as it serves in the burning of fats. Alcohol does not
become glycogen, or give rise to the ketones, the substances
that lead to acidosis and eventually to diabetic coma. Thus,
with alcohol in the diet, it is possible to use a smaller
amount of insulin than would otherwise be the case. The
physiology and chemistry of these bodily reactions is a com
plicated matter.
Many competent physicians prefer to treat their cases of
diabetes without the use of alcohol. No doubt an equally
large number prefer to be in a position where they can use
a pleasant form of this remedy if they feel the need for it.
The late M. Duclaux, of the Pasteur Institute, was so much
impressed by the experimental evidence on this question
that he asserted that alcohol was a food surpassing starch
and sugar in value, since weight for weight it contained more
energy.
Many experiments have been cited to show that alcohol is
harmful. Every one admits the validity of those experiments
that indicated its detrimental effect on precise mental opera
tions, such as are involved in typewriting, target shooting,
typesetting, and motor driving. On the other hand, mental
operations are shortened, the simple reactions and reaction
times quickened, mental associations (such as making words
to rhyme) made easier, and public speaking indulged in
with facility. This has been thought to be the result of pri
mary mental stimulation. But Professor W. E. Dixon, the

noted British pharmacologist, emphasizes the fact that these
effects are the result of inhibition or depression of the higher
centers of the brain.
It is safe to say that there is not the slightest scientific
evidence to indicate that alcohol taken in moderation ever
appreciably shortened one's existence. "When it is taken in
strict moderation, injurious effects are yet to be proved,"
says Professor Dixon. The evidence presented by Professor
Raymond Pearl, the eminent biometrician of Johns Hopkins
University, cannot be gainsaid. In a fairly large and homo
genous sample of the working class population of Baltimore
the moderate drinking of alcohol did not shorten life. In
deed, moderate steady drinkers showed somewhat lower
rates of mortality and greater expectation of life than did
total abstainers. On the other hand, those persons who were
heavy drinkers of alcoholic beverages showed considerably
increased rates of mortality and diminished longevity, as
compared with abstainers or moderate drinkers.
HEAVY DRINKERS
The people who create an alcohol problem are obviously
the heavy drinkers. They are, after all, cases for a psychi
atrist, since their problem is a mental problem. They take
too much alcohol because only with too much alcohol do
they feel normal. The interior of the body of the drunkard
shows the effects of alcohol as a poison. The final result of
alcoholic intoxication repeatedly indulged in is delirium
tremens —certainly a state of disease requiring serious con
sideration.
Professor Pearl emphasizes the beneficial effects of alcohol
on the race, since it has a remarkably sharp and precise
selective action on germ cells and developing embryos, kill
ing off the weak and defective, and leaving the strong and
sound to survive and perpetuate the race. The fact has been
proved on guinea pigs, fowls, rats, mice, rabbits, frogs, and
insects. But if this fact is applied to the human race, an
entirely different point of view must be held, since the care

social problem.
Professor Pearl insists that the prevalent notion that
parental alcoholism tends to cause the production of weak,
defective, or monstrous progeny is not supported by the ex
tensive body of experimental work that has been done on
the problem. But there is some evidence to sustain this
point of view. The German scientist, H. W. Siemens, states
the matter briefly: "The cultured peoples of antiquity dis
appeared, despite the fact that they had no syphilis and that
the alcohol industry was unknown to them. No uniform
explanation of the downfall of all vanished peoples is
afforded, therefore, by pointing to alcohol, to syphilis, or
any similar agent. Above all, we know far too little as yet
with regard to the influences that cause alterations in the
germ plasm to permit us to draw any conclusions that would
guide us to logical action."
SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE ON PROHIBITION
A debate took place not long ago on prohibition. There
was a dry lecturer —dry in more than one sense. He was
lecturing on the advantages of a perfect heredity, and he
thought he would give a few examples. He looked out into
the audience and he said, "Is Mr. Eckles in the audience?"
An old man up near the front said, "I am here."
"Will you stand up?"
He stood up.
"How old are you?"
"I am seventy-six years old."
"Are you a total abstainer, Mr. Eckles?"
"Yes, I never took a drink in my life."
The lecturer said, "Ladies and gentlemen, look at that
man. Seventy-six, and never took a drink in his life. Isn't that
wonderful? Is Mr. Thompson in the audience?"
A fellow away in the back says, "I'm here."
"Stand up, will you, Mr. Thompson?"
Mr. Thompson stood up.

Then an Irishman, away in the back of the hall said,
"Hold on a minute. Is this an open meeting? Can anyone
say a word?"
The lecturer said, "Yes. Anyone who has anything to con
tribute is welcome to stand up and give his views and evi

The little Irishman stood up and he said, "It's this way.
My father died about six years ago and he_was ninety-six
years old. He took his first drink when he was fourteen years
old and he had two drinks every day after that until the day
he died, and he is dead now about six years. Last week they
called us up from the cemetery and said they were going
to move the cemetery and asked us to come out and take
the old man up. We went out and dug him up. We opened
the coffin and looked at him, and by golly, he looked better
than either one of these two fellows you have just had stand

LIGHT, HEAT, AND ELECTRICITY
"A fool's bolt is soon shot." —Old English Proverb.
No
doubt the first agents of treatment used by man were
those which could be had through simple adaptations
of things natural. The application of heat and cold, rubbing
and massage, and the use of water and of sunlight are as old
as man himself. In the aphorisms of Hippocrates one reads
of the uses of such methods; even at that time sound ob
servers seem to have realized that these agents may act for
good or for evil.
"Heat is suppurative," says one aphorism, "but not in all
kinds of sores; but when it is, it furnishes the greatest test
of their being free from danger. It softens the skin, makes
it thin, removes pain, soothes rigor, convulsions, and teta
nus." But again, "Heat produces the following bad effects
on those who use it frequently: enervation of the fleshy
parts, impotence of the nerves, torpor of the understanding,
hemorrhages, deliquia, and along with these, death." And in
commenting on the latter aphorism, Galen and, still later,
Celsus, said: "By 'heat' is meant 'hot water' or a 'hot fomen
tation.'
"
Massage, too, was practiced in the earliest times. Anthro
pologists and ethnologists have described the practice as it
exists among savage peoples today, and accounts are found in
primitive medical texts. It is repeatedly referred to in the
folklore of all nations, particularly in the tales of the Arabian
Nights. Such massage included not only simple rubbing, but

Swedish investigators with technical terms.
ANCIENT PHYSICAL THERAPY
The ancient Egyptians, the Greeks, and the Romans were
firm believers in the health-giving powers of the sun's rays.
Indeed, Herodotus asserted that light must be regarded by
the physician who knows his business as a means of repelling
illness and as a subsequent aid to recovery. There were sun
rooms in the homes of all the well-to-do Romans, not glassed-
in sun parlors facing north, as in our apartments today, but
large central spaces, open to the sky and to the sun itself.
Humphris tells us that the first use of electricity in heal
ing took place in the time of Tiberius, some twenty years
after the death of Christ, when a physician named Scribo-
nius Largus made use of the raja torpedo fish for rheumatism
and for headaches. The electric rayfish and the electric eel
of Brazil are said to be able to convey a considerable shock.
Scribonius Largus was, however, known chiefly for the scope
of his writings, as his name no doubt indicates. His recom
mendation was based, apparently, wholly on empiricism.
Much the same sort of reasoning assigned unusual virtues
to mixtures of drugs of foul smell or of nauseous taste. The
results commonly are the proof of the power of suggestion.
Of the birth of the Rontgen ray and of the finer electric
apparatus of our modern times, accurate descriptions are
easily available. From the primitive observations of the past
have arisen these remarkably complicated devices that have
made necessary increased knowledge by the physician of
physics and of chemistry, of physiology and of biology, and
that call for a finer discrimination in their choice and in
their application to disease than it has been necessary to
accord to many of the drugs used in medicine.
The knowledge of physical therapy which forms the basis
of the considerations here presented is not derived from
personal observation of the devices used in physical therapy,
from an intimate study of their effects on animals or on
patients, or even from their actual trial on my own physical

conferences with many specialists in this growing field, and,
finally, from an attempt to apply to the assembled informa
tion what is known as editorial judgment —a thing some
times called by cynics the result of a disordered digestion.
The use of outdoor sunlight and of baths is not an exceed
ingly costly procedure and it is doubtful that anyone ever
spent a great deal of money on these methods of healing.
The moment personal attention and intricate apparatus come
upon the scene, however, there is introduced the question
of financial outlay. It is pitiable indeed that many a suf
ferer who should have devoted his funds to the securing of
proper nursing attention and of suitable residence in a sana
torium should have spent considerable amounts on manipu
lation by untrained hands or hands trained to unscientific
performance, or that the necessary money should be devoted
to the purchase of extraordinary lights or electrical devices
that are found shortly on the scrap heap.
VIOLET RAYS
The credulity of mankind in regard to such apparatus is
astounding. It is now beginning to be generally known that
the short rays at the end of the spectrum are invisible. Never
theless, they are badly named. True, they are in the violet
zone of the spectral colors, but the mere attachment of the
word "violet" to these rays causes innumerable people to be
lieve that any violet-looking light is ultra-violet ray. Not
long ago, I stopped briefly in a chain drugstore where a

statuesque blonde was demonstrating to two prosperous look
ing business men a new device which she called the "sun
ray lamp." It was merely an ordinary bathroom heater with
a violet colored bulb in the place where the usual heating
element resides. She said to these two interested observers,
"Gentlemen, this gives you the real violet ray." And when
they answered with the usual American response, "Is that
so?" she said, "Yes, and besides the bulb is medicated." Just
why this second announcement should have been so con
vincing I have never been able to understand, but they paid
their money and got a useless piece of apparatus for it.
I have seen a bald-headed barber in a barbershop waving a
purple colored incandescent bulb around the head of a bald-
headed man while solemnly telling him that these ultra
violet rays will cause the growth of hair. There is not the
slightest evidence that ultra-violet rays applied to the head
of a man with hereditary baldness will do anything but tan
the skin or burn it. Certainly they do not grow hair. Never
theless, a great syndicate of hair-growing shops for men has
been built up with this notion.
VIBRATIONS
Then, too, thousands, or actually hundreds of thousands,
of people have been shaking their systems into insensibility
with electric belts that produce vibration, with the belief
that such vibration was conducive to health and longevity.
One old judge put his belt around his head to shake off a
headache and instead shook loose the retina of his eye so
that he developed blindness. Another corpulent business
man so agitated his midriff as to bring about perforation of
a gastric ulcer.
There is danger in physical therapy unwisely used, per
haps danger beyond almost any other medical methods.
There is, indeed, in this field merely the beginning of scien
tific study notwithstanding some hundreds of years of
practice.

FADS AND QUACKERY IN HEALING
SCIENCE VERSUS EMPIRICISM
The proper evaluation of evidence regarding the use of
new methods in the treatment of disease is difficult. The
patient is anxious to be well, the physician wants to see him
cured or at least benefited as promptly as possible, and his
friends and relatives constantly endeavor to encourage him,
regardless of their actual belief as to the state of his illness.
The result of this continuous positive suggestion is to lend
to any method of treatment that may be employed a credence
that is perhaps not its actual due. Few physicians—and, in
deed, few scientists —can resist the hyperenthusiasm that is
likely to follow a first successful result. The paths of the his
tory of therapy are bestrewn with the wrecks of new cures
that sailed forth as the last word in therapeutic achievement.
Mental, manipulative, natural, mystical, spiritual, and other
cures have been brought forth by apostles of healing and
vaunted as the secret for the solution of all the problems
of healing that have confronted the physician since the earli
est times. But when the apostle died, or when the primal
faith that animated his followers disappeared, the cure went
the way of the apostle.
Now, physical therapy has been more subject to misun
derstanding of its efficacy in varied conditions than has any
other form used by the scientific physician. The potency of
the placebo depends only on the mental suggestion and on
the personality of the man who administers it. His contact
with the patient is not direct. The contact of the chiroprac
tor, the osteopath, and the religious healer consists usually
of the direct laying on of hands. Few physicians of experi
ence fail to realize the importance of such immediate rela
tionship to the patient. If more physicians took the trouble
to make thorough examinations of their patients, never fail
ing to examine the chest after the clothing had been com
pletely removed from the upper part of the body and using
auscultation, percussion, and palpation, which are fundamen
tal to physical diagnosis, there would be fewer failures and
many more persons satisfied with the care of their physicians.

LIGHT, HEAT, AND ELECTRICITY
SUGGESTION IN PHYSICAL THERAPY
Without doubt, powerful suggestion is conveyed by the
use of any intricate or striking mechanical method. The use
of electricity, including the direct application of the cur
rent, the galvanic apparatus, pocket batteries, and all the as
sorted forms of waves supplied through more intricate mech
anisms, as well as the use of electricity to produce heat and
light, is a striking therapeutic procedure. The late—but not
too late—Albert Abrams well knew the value of intricate
apparatus for impressing the patient and, even more, for
impressing the uncritical physician. His first venture, spon-
dylotherapy, carried With it a physically intensified sugges
tion; and those later Goldbergian evolvements, the oscillo-
clast and the biodynamometer, were impressive in their com
plexity, even to some competent physicians.
Regardless of the fact that the underlying basis for many
physical methods never has been thoroughly established and,
indeed, is not even yet perfectly understood, the official
organ of the American Electrotherapeutic Association only
recently said: "The various irregular cults have also worked
out in some instances methods that have sometimes suc
ceeded where the rank and file of the medical profession
have failed." The editorial referred to cites particularly the
treatment of sacro-iliac strain, recommending, first, adjust
ment and, secondly, the application of electricity. On what
basis does the editorial presume to say that displaced verte
brae once adjusted remain adjusted, unless held in place over
long periods of time by methods of fixation? Who has proved
that ligaments that are relaxed will resume their functions
when the supposed luxations are properly replaced? Who has
made the scientific studies, using the Rontgen ray and all
the other methods known to modern science, by which even
an iota of truth can be attached to the claims of chiropractic
and, indeed, to most of those of osteopathy? Granting that
there is a modicum of truth in the claims of the latter cult,
what scientific organization will be willing to admit that

demanding of the human body and its mechanisms should
be privileged to apply any single form of therapy or
diagnosis?
THE DANGERS OF SYSTEMS AND SPECIALTIES
If medicine is to be partitioned off into a series of special
ties and cults practiced by men who have learned only one
organ of the body or only one system of diagnosing and of
treating disease, medicine as a science is bound to fail. No
part of the human body can be detached and treated as sepa
rate from the organism as a whole. This danger threatens
all the forms of physical therapy. It was no doubt enthusiasm
for a single method that caused an editorial writer in the
official organ of electrotherapy to say that "physical therapy
will ultimately be recognized as of greater value that all
other therapeutic methods." This concentration on an "all
or nothing" policy in the treatment of disease must inevit
ably lead to preposterous and exaggerated claims, and ulti
mately to the detriment of scientific practice. Physicians
have watched the inroads made on the practice of medicine
as a single science. They have noted the attempts of optom
etrists to parcel off the eye as their particular field; of cos
meticians to assume the right to treat disorders of the skin
and to request legislatures to grant them power to remove
moles, warts, tumors, and other excrescences; of chiropodists
to assign to themselves the complete care of the feet; of
chiropractors and osteopaths to make the field of manual
manipulation their exclusive purview; and of some of the
specialists within the ranks of medicine itself to assign all
important functions to the teeth, to the lungs, or to other
organs of the body. The time has come to call a halt on geo
graphic warfare within the human body, and to look on it as
a "united states" that will be at least as firmly consolidated
as the forty-eight individual constituents of our government.
If electrotherapy could point to a past that was free from
the faults that have marred the progress of drug therapy
since the earliest times, it would need no caution as to the
future. But what has become of the hundreds of galvanic

apparatus that struck amazement to the hearts of trembling
children led into physicians' offices some twenty-five years
ago? Where are the little electric batteries that formerly oc
cupied the showcases in the drug stores? Indeed, what has
become of the claims for high voltage Rontgen rays in the
removal of deep-seated malignancy? What a brief period it
required for these claims, vaunted as the last word in the
control of cancer, to resolve themselves into a method used
only in apparently hopeless cases! The judgment may be
premature, but it is based on scientific studies made in well
recognized institutions for the study of human diseases.
PHYSICAL THERAPY PROMOTION
There was a time when the medical scientist, having com
pleted his education in the field to which he wished to de
vote himself, opened his office, began teaching in a medical
school with which he had affiliated himself, undertook the
care of patients in legitimate hospitals, and left it to the
recognition of the public to advance him to the limit of his
merits. Today, modern, high powered business methods ap
plied to the practice of medicine have pointed the way to
cults and to the hyperenthusiastic practitioner for promo
tion of his particular plans. All the forces of publicity are
directed toward urging on the public the peculiar advan
tages that are claimed to accrue to single methods. The high
priest of the peculiar system does not hesitate to instruct
his followers in promotion of the system by all the arts and
crafts —mostly the crafts —of salesmanship. There are physi
cal therapists who believe that "high frequency" means the
treatment of eighty patients a day. Again, organizations are
established, not for study and investigation or for the pro
motion of knowledge in relation to the growth of any de
partment of medical science, but primarily for the securing
of public acclaim through the organization, rather than
through the individual. The multiplicity of medical organi
zations is evidence of the fact that in some instances they are
not established with investigation and study as their main
objects. Consider in this connection the society called the

Association for Medico-Physical Research. In its meeting,
one program is devoted entirely to the claims of the now dis
credited Abrams method; another, to the exploitation of
methods for the treatment of cancer, not one of which is
established on any sort of a sound foundation; and still
others to the promotion of systems of practice that should
meet with nothing but the scorn of all who consider them
selves honest and ethical practitioners of medicine. One
finds here names of men known as faddists, who have dis
carded scientific rationality. One, without regard to the estab
lished facts of science, insists that a rice diet will prevent and
cure cancer. Another promotes the treatment of cancer with
a serum, regardless of the fact that carefully made investiga
tions have revealed the failure of his method. There is G.
E. Harter of the Defensive Diet League of America, who has
collected a lot of miscellaneous aphorisms and peculiar con
cepts concerning food into a system and who has inveigled
dentists of this country to his support with the idea that it
is the duty of the dentists to establish the food habits of
the nation. Among this miscellaneous crew of peculiar fad
dists appear the names of some physicians whose places on
the program apparently represent an attempt to camouflage,
with a sort of medical aristocracy, the fallacies that occupy
the major portion of the program.
BASIS OF PHYSICAL THERAPY
The results of physical therapy seem to depend on many
factors. Without doubt, rays of light have many and vary
ing effects on the human body. Attempts have been made to
separate them into effects of the light itself on the tissues
and into chemical effects. Electricity has the power of acting
through the heat that may be produced and, perhaps, through
some effects produced by the current itself not yet deter
mined; indeed, the mechanism is no better determined than
is that of immunity in general. Electric stimulation no doubt
has the power to act on nerves and on muscles, producing
visible motive effects; and with such effects come mechanical
changes. Is it not time that intensive study be applied in an

analytic manner to determine to just what extent the bene
fits observed from the various electrotherapeutic measures
are due to physical changes in the tissues, to mechanical
changes in the tissues, to the power of suggestion, and, per
haps, to other factors of which we know nothing? Until
some adequate basis on which the methods may rest is de
termined, no one can call such methods truly scientific. We
have in physical therapy various methods of producing heat
in the human body. There is the heat produced by friction;
the heat produced by the external application of light, of
hot water, or of other heat-producing methods; and the heat
produced within the body by diathermy, by the direct in
jection of heating material, or by the use of methods that
will draw unusual quantities of blood to a certain point.
In the evaluation of any form of physical therapy, who shall
say to what extent the thermic factor alone is responsible
and how far the other factors that have been mentioned have
a part to play?
The numerous devices for effecting the production of
heat, external or internal, for the body unquestionably vary
in their potency and in their mechanism. How is the individ
ual physician who knows little or nothing of the physical
basis of electricity and, in fact, who knows little or nothing
of any physics at all, except in the use of the term as it
applies to castor oil and cascara, to have any actual knowl
edge of these so-called modalities?
Drug products are compounds of chemical substances and
may easily be separated into their individual ingredients.
Scientific pharmacy has already made sufficient progress to
warrant the statement that these ingredients will or will not
do what is claimed for them. But when one is confronted
with a large box beautifully trimmed with nickel plate and
glass, the interior of which is a mass of wiring, spools, coils,
gages, screws, nuts, and what not, and is told that, properly
applied, this apparatus will cure pneumonia, neuritis, lum
bago, eczema, dysmenorrhea, falling of the uterus, and fall

that the spine of the patient with locomotor ataxia may be
restored to its pristine glory by running a few shocks up and
down from the cervical region to the coccyx, is he to discard
the prognosis that he has made in the past and to tell the
friends and relatives of the victim of the wiles of Venus
that his lapse from virtue is to have no further evil effects?
What is the physician to do when he learns that most of the
textbooks in this field are the products of men who are
employed by concerns selling apparatus; when he is con
stantly besieged with lecture courses paid for by those who
have something to sell; when his office is inundated with
literature telling him that his financial future depends on
the purchase of a vast amount of such machinery? Clearly,
a housecleaning is badly needed in this particular field.
The advance of electrotherapeutics under the guidance of
its pioneers was an enthusiastic but bitter warfare against a
stubborn and conservative medical profession. The introduc
tion of unknown forces into the treatment of disease meant
that physicians untrained in the basic sciences on which a
comprehension of these forces depends must begin anew
their period of infancy and education, or yield their patients
and their livelihood to those better informed. So far as elec
trotherapy is concerned, physicians have felt, no doubt with
reason, that they must be shown. Whether this fortunate
scientific skepticism was founded on a scientific frame of
mind, or was merely an obstinate resistance to what was
apparently an incomprehensible phase of medical treatment,
is a matter for conjecture. In any event, the inspired pio
neers of electrotherapy have had little patience with oppo
sition, no doubt feeling that it was not based on comprehen
sive understanding of the things which to them seemed as
simple as the child's alphabet. Let us, with editorial judg
ment, take the middle ground. No doubt the position of the
medical profession regarding physical therapy has been un
reasoning and blind; but just as certainly the enthusiasms
of the pioneers were a beautiful manifestation of the credu
lous will-to-believe. Science demands controlled observa

tions; it requires due precautions against the will-to-believe,
definite allowance for the vis medicatrix natures, and simple
admission that there is much that we do not know. The repe
tition of these aphorisms may sound as infantile as the
squeaky "mamma" of the Christmas doll; but, alas, how nec
essary the repetition seems to be! When the allowances are
all made, it seems that more must be granted at this time
to those who opposed than to those who proposed, in the
field of electrotherapy.
With the passing of time, the pioneers began to adapt
themselves for the most part to the knowledge that medicine
began to acquire from the fundamental sciences. The dis
coveries in chemistry, in physics, in biology, in physiology,
and in pathology began to make themselves felt in the physi
cal therapeutic field. If one scans the reports made through
the passing years, the names of masters of these related
fields will be found in the records. Always apparent is the
intent to eliminate the unscientific, to determine the actual
physical basis of apparatus and of methods, and to detect
physiologic and pathologic changes such as may have oc
curred.
THE TEACHERS OF PHYSICAL THERAPY
Education in physical therapy today may be had through
the available literature, represented by advertisements,
pamphlets, articles in periodicals and textbooks; through
courses in physical therapy given by well-established schools
and hospitals, by the paid representatives of manufacturing
concerns, and by impromptu teachers with no credentials
other than a profound belief in their own erudition; through
the suave representations of detail men who know well how
to befuddle the brain of the busy practitioner with a nomen
clature fit for nothing so much as the construction of cross
word puzzles. Indeed, like all the literature of medicine, of
art, of science, of religion, and even of literature itself to
day, that of physical therapy may be divided into two main
groups—the commercial literature and the literature of sci
ence. The groups infringe on one another to the extent that

the literature of science is commercial. Even a moron might
follow easily the path of commerce or of science; but the
unenlightened physician who wishes to tread the devious
path between will need a guide to prevent him from stray
ing into blind alleys and treacherous by-paths, and, indeed,
from losing his way altogether.
At the meeting of the Modern Language Association held
in Chicago recently, William McFee suggested that the
American literature of the future would perhaps be the liter
ature of commerce rather than the literature of science and
of art. Since commercial organizations demand and pay for
the best available literary talent, the magazine of the future
may well consist of a central section of advertising written
by masters in the literary field, surrounded by the rather
dull pages of fiction produced by apprentices in the trade.
Of course, even under the present it is hard to tell where
the fiction ends and where the advertising begins in many
periodicals. The cautious purchaser never forgets that the
aphorism "Whose bread I eat, his song I sing" represents
the psychologic observation of centuries.
The literature of commerce is a literature of affirmation;
search as one may through page on page of circular, bulle
tin, or advertising pamphlet, the statement of negation is a
rarity. The literature is inspirational, leading inevitably to
the signature on the dotted line. Even the most stupid of
readers must already have noted the application to the field
of electrotherapy of the fundamental psychologic fact dis
covered perhaps by Messrs. Macfadden and Hearst and
widely exploited in their periodicals. Most of the illustra
tions used in the folders on physical therapy, observant
readers have pointed out, represent the application of physi
cal therapeutic methods, not to unfortunate soldiers, coal-
miners, and teamsters, but to beautiful damsels, apparently
in the pink of health, who have unveiled quite excessive por
tions of their intimate anatomy for the local application of
a one-square inch electrode or the application otherwise of
the healing heat or invisible ray.

comes sometimes frankly with the mark of commerce
stamped on its pages; sometimes camouflaged behind the
name of a physician who obviously is in the employ of, or
has most certainly been influenced by, the concern devoted
to the sale of the particular device. Frequently it is never
theless the earnest effort of a sincere scientist to record his
honest observations for the good of his fellow physicians and
for the benefit of mankind. Actually, the field of physical
therapy is not nearly so bestrewn with the flimsy invitations
of verbose commercial barkers as was the field of drug ther
apy at its worst some twenty-five years ago. There are, and
have been, in the electric manufacturing field producers
who have seen that permanent business demanded sound
ness from the start. They have proceeded cautiously in the
issuing of advertising matter. They have attempted to state
the facts concerning their devices and left it to scientific ob
servation by clinicians to provide the claims. On the other
hand, some manufacturing concerns have champed impa
tiently at the delay in adoption of their devices by cautious
members of the medical profession. These business men, not
content with the scientific observations made in well-con
trolled laboratories and clinics, have gone afield for the pro
vision of their material, or have purchased the full time of
easily credulous and perhaps not too meticulously ethical
observers to supply claims for their machinery. The state
ment is a broad one, but it will be supported in due time by
documentary evidence.
An investigation of the curriculums of medical colleges
indicates that but few are ready to give courses in this
branch of medical treatment. A survey of the hospitals of
our country finds few of them adequately equipped with
physical therapeutic apparatus; many are supplied with obso
lete and inefficient, perhaps sadly rusted and degenerated,
types; still others, equipped in the heyday of some lax politi
cal appropriation, present whole edifices devoted to intricate
apparatus, both good and bad, which lie idle because of the
lack of competent men and women to manipulate them. In

this situation the practitioner turns naturally to possible
sources of information.
The physician is informed by one concern or another that
he may secure the privilege of instruction from an expert
who is endowed by the manufacturing concern which pro
motes him with nothing short of celestial wisdom. The
courses are offered free or for nominal sums, but are never
theless commercial courses. Try as it may, the manufactur
ing concern which endeavors to promote the sale of its de
vices by the direct teaching of the physician cannot separate
its teacher from the charge of commercialism. That teacher
may be honest, his intentions may be of the best, he may
even attempt to lean backward to avoid the taint of com
mercialism; but, as the poet eulogized:
You may break, you may shatter the vase if you will,
But the scent of the roses (?) will hang round

it

no announcement that
physical therapy will bring to the practitioner taking the

tics, and even of light therapy apart from therapeutics, that
the practitioner is likely to consider its study, and most cer
tainly investment in apparatus, little worth while. On the
other hand, the enthusiastic outbursts in volumes by ac
cepted leaders in this field are a strain on the credulity of
the most mellow of minds. One author considers that "one of
the most effective uses of electricity is the relief, and at
times the cure, of all degrees of descension of the uterus,
except possible complete procidentia." "It is probable," he
asserts, "that every puerperal woman would be the better
for a course of nongalvanic rhythmic currents after cessa
tion of the lochia." He advises "cathode depigmentation"
for the removal of freckles; electric ionization for the cure
of salpingitis, and, in fact, finds some use for electricity in
every possible physical or mental condition that afflicts the
human body. Actually, he recommends the treatment of ec
topic gestation by electrocution of the fetus before the fourth
month, and the use of more moderate currents afterward to
promote its absorption. He wisely suggests that in the mean
time the patient should be at absolute rest in bed, with the
constant attendance of a nurse.
And yet these statements of presumably scientific writers
on electric therapy are mild indeed compared with the lucu
brations of the commercial wielders of the pen who are in
hibited by no scientific doubts whatever in their develop
ment of literature that will sell the goods. Speaking of the
incandescent lamp, one of them says:
When you use a thermotherapeutic light, you invoke
nature's strongest force, the most permanent therapeutic
power.
Another statement says of diathermy:
No physician's office, no hospital or sanitarium is complete
without some good physical therapy equipment —particu
larly a diathermy apparatus of the portable or semiportable
type. Such a machine is a very decided requisite if modern
methods of medicine and surgery are to be employed.

Just how much more requisite a "decided requisite" or a
"very decided requisite" may be than something that is just
"requisite," deponent sayeth not.
And finally, for it would be possible to multiply these ex
amples interminably, hearken to this section of "Resusci
tated Sunlight":
We are all familiar with the marvelous vitalizing, beauti
fying and regenerating power of Sunlight. We have seen the
earth, brown and sear in early Springtime, quicken to life
and beauty; the tiny buds burst their prison cells, and de
velop into flower and fruitage; the fetid odors of putrescence
disappear —and all, under this magic influence of the sun's
rays.
Yes, more; we have watched with keenest interest the red
blood come into the veins, sparkle into the eye and vigor
into the limb of the anemic and invalid, through the stimu
lating effects of the "Sun Bath." But somehow, we limit the
Electric Light to its luminous qualities, forgetful that in it
we have real "bottled sunshine" under our absolute con
trol, ready for application when desired and with the widest
range of adaptation.
As the physicist has learned, the Electric Light is identical
with Sunlight; in fact, it is Sunlight resuscitated from the
energy long stored in the lumps of coal used as fuel. This
latent energy in the coal, liberated in the furnace and trans
formed in the dynamo, is flashed forth again in radiance
from the electric arc, or incandescent filament, on its inter
rupted mission of service to the world. In other words, that
subtle force—that potent silent process that tints the petals
of the lilac and the lily, that scents the rose and the jasmine,
that flavors the ripening fruit in the orchard—is one and the
same of Nature's forces, whether at work in the flower gar
den, on the sands of the seashore, or in the Light Baths.
It is presumed that the gentleman who wrote this state

tion. As has been intimated, the schools of medicine and
the postgraduate schools offer but few courses, and those not
continuously. Moreover, mushroom schools have sprung up
here and there to offer such courses to any aspirant, be he
chiropractor, osteopath, cosmetician, chiropodist, barber,
farmhand, or blacksmith. Who has denned the point at
which the work of the physical therapy aide or technician
ends or commences? The ignorant cultist, licensed by a too
complaisant state to practice some single system of diagnosis
and treatment, finds his patients seldom inclined to inquire
whether or not his fundamental training warrants the use
of the potent electrical devices with which he may have
equipped himself. Indeed, most often this course of study
has embraced some hours with the detail man or demon
strator and a cursory study of the book of directions, if he
happens to be able to read. Even the "naturopath" equips
himself with artificial sunlight against the day when the
clouds obscure the sky, although information has not yet
been received that he has secured artificial grass and bottled
dew for his nightgown-clad hypochondriacs to walk in while
the artificial sun may shine.
The medical practice acts of our individual states make
strange allowances for all sorts of unusual encroachments
on the practice of medicine. Legislators seems not yet to
have realized that the ability to diagnose disease according
to the facts of modern scientific medicine is, and legally
should be, an absolute prerequisite to any sort of treatment.
The nurse, the technician, the aide, or whatever high sound
ing title may be conferred on a medical assistant, gains con
fidence with time and soon wishes to depart from the shelter
ing wing of the physician whom she may assist, to establish
herself in her self-constituted profession of physical therapist.
In several states the new laws regulating the practice of
cosmetology specifically exempt the other new profession
of electrology so far as concerns the removal of superfluous
hair, moles, warts, or excrescences from the skin.

THE FUTURE OF PHYSICAL THERAPY
Today more than seventy-five per cent of the leading hos
pitals of the United States have fully equipped departments
of physical therapy in charge of physicians especially trained
in the use of such devices and methods, and not infrequently
conducted by technicians who are capable of using the ap
paratus without danger to the patient and under proper
medical instruction. For the treatment of rheumatic dis
ease, for the overcoming of paralysis after such diseases as
infantile paralysis and meningitis, for reeducating the para
lytic who is suffering with locomotor ataxia, for straight
ening twisted spines and for many similar purposes physical
therapy is invaluable.
Standardization and control are particularly the attributes
of American civilization. Proper standardization and con
trol are only beginning to be applied to the field of physical
therapy through the Councils on Medical Education and
Hospitals and the Council on Physical Therapy of the Amer
ican Medical Association. The setting up and maintenance
of such standards mean much for the safety of the American
people and for the maintenance of their health.

MEDICINE AND THE PRESS
"But let a man know that there are things to be known, of which he
is ignorant, and it is so much carved out of his domain of universal
knowledge." —Horace Mann, Lectures on Education.
Some
seventeen years ago, I originated in The Journal of
the American Medical Association a column called
"Tonics and Sedatives" in which appear each week, in addi
tion to medical facetiae, errors of a medical nature clipped
from newspapers, magazines, and books throughout the
country. Glancing over the assembled material, one finds
that it may be grouped according to certain definite types.
First are typographical errors that do no harm to anyone.
According to modern newspaper methods a hasty guess is
good enough to serve the purpose as far as the name of a
disease may be concerned: "Miliary tuberculosis" frequently
appears as "military tuberculosis"; "hypostatic pneumonia"
as "hypothetic pneumonia"; "exploratory operation" as "ex
planatory operation"; "cardiac decompensation" as "cardiac
decomposition"; "vertebra misplaced" as "vertebrate mis
placed"; "vasoligation" as "vasolitigation"; "cocci" as "cock
eye"; "prostate gland" as "prostrate gland"; "iritis" as "eye-
ritis"; "angina pectoris" as "angora pectoris"; and "inguinal
hernia" as "lingual hernia." These errors represent the sub
stitution of some word in common usage for a technical
term requiring special knowledge. They are perhaps the in
evitable result of that system of news reporting which calls
for eight editions each day, appearing three to five hours
before the time with which they are labeled. They result

possibly from that queer triple play, legman to telephone to
rewrite man, by which most of the local news is put out.
In matters of anatomy, organs, muscles, bones, and joints
may find themselves strangely displaced in newspaper re
ports. The fibula, from the leg, is accredited to the hip. One
reads of a "mastoid abscess of the eye," whereas the mastoid
is situated behind the ear. Persons are reported as dying
from pleurisy of the shoulder and collar bone, of the kidney,
of the heart, and of the intestines. The pleura is the mem
brane lining the chest cavity and covering the lung. It is
spelled p-1-e-u-r-a, as can be found in any dictionary, and yet
it far more frequently appears that someone has died from
"p-l-u-r-a-1" pneumonia, certainly a singular statement. Dur
ing the illness of President Wilson, the official bulletin,
published in Washington under the editorship of George
Creel, created to supply the public with facts, contained in
a boxed statement on its first page, the following absurd
announcement:
Owing to the various rumors that are going about regard
ing the condition of President Wilson, we state that he has
not had a paralytic shock, nor has he had any of the other
troubles about which the gossips are busy. The President is
suffering from inflammation of the prostatic gland, which is
properly known as acute bowel trouble.
If "inflammation of the prostatic gland" is properly known
as "acute bowel trouble," the medical profession has been
wrongly instructed about the matter ever since it first found
out there was a prostate.
Still more remarkable statements are made as to the causes
of various diseases. The excellent foreign correspondent of
the Chicago Tribune, Floyd Gibbons, cabled that lockjaw
or tetanus was prevalent because of the large number of
rusty nails. Thus he perpetuated an old superstition and dis
regarded entirely the bacterial origin of the disease. The
Kansas City Times remarked sagely:
William II has a bad inheritance. His great uncle, Fred
erick William IV, died with a clouded mind. William him

self has had an ear abscess, the true diagnosis of which has
never been made public. This has given ground to a rumor
that it is of a hereditary leucorrheal character.
Leucorrhea, it may be explained, is a condition occurring
only in women, and that, too, in regions remote from the
ear. The error arose no doubt through the modest substitu
tion, by some editor, of the word "leucorrhea" for the name
of a venereal disease which sounds much the same and which
he hesitated to print.
In surgery the newspaper writer has wide latitude for his
imagination. The Baltimore Sun sagely explains that "gastro-
enteroanastamase is the medical term for ulcers of the stom
ach," but "gastroenteroanastomosis" is, instead, the surgical
term for sidetracking the movement of food by joining to
gether the stomach and the intestine. Another item tells of
a man who was operated on for "Albee of the spine,"
whereas Albee is the name of a surgeon who designed the
operation in which the bones of the spine are splinted stiffly
together with a piece of bone taken from the leg. At least
a hundred times, I have seen the statement that a leg was
broken, but not fractured, and one does not have to be a
physician to know better than that.
Certain remarkable tales circulate through the press peri
odically much as an influenza epidemic returns at intervals
to devastate the populace. A news bulletin will carry the
astounding information that a noted specialist has cured the
eyesight of a patient by removing the eyeball, washing it, or
scraping it, and returning it to its cavity. Again some press
service will circulate this perennial tale. It is a figment of
the imagination and possibly arises from the fact that an un
trained onlooker at the ophthalmic operation becomes dizzy
with the escaping fumes of the anesthetic. Here is a story
that has recently made the rounds of hundreds of papers:
There is a girl here at the Shrine hospital about fifteen
years old, who has a snake in her stomach. They have no
idea about how it happened to be there, but the doctors
think that it must have crawled in her mouth when she was

sleeping or in swimming some time. The snake is about two
feet long and three inches around, and sometimes they say
it is stretched out as far as it can in her stomach.
The number of amphibia, reptilia, and other zoological spe
cies that have been reported in the newspapers as the day's
catch for some enterprising physician is legion. Sometimes
they are not hooked out of the stomach from above, but re
moved at other orifices as the product of an unusual con
ception. When the stories are traced to their respective
sources, they invariably degenerate into some hoax. In one
case, it was discovered that some of the older nurses in a hos
pital were anxious to impress an innocent probationer with
the wonders of medical science. The assistance of an obliging
interne —the interne is always willing to oblige the nurses —
was secured. At the time of the operation, the interne drew
forth a squirming length of rubber tubing, the probationer
was duly impressed, and a news-seeking reporter sent the
story on its route.
A paragraph might be given to the story of the feverish
girl of Escanaba; for almost three weeks her temperature
was reported as ranging up to 118 degrees F. and once, it
was alleged, the mercury blew off the top of the thermom
eter. Her story was not unique in the annals of medical
science. Almost any hospital could produce records of pa
tients who had attempted similar impostures and success
fully eluded the detective methods of physicians over long
periods of time. In the case of the girl from Escanaba, the
long run of the story depended on a number of factors: the
news came from a distance sufficient to deter investigation;
the girl was not in a hospital where her actions could be
controlled; her physicians had lost their skepticism which
the great Pasteur said was the distinguishing mark of the
scientist. Finally the news was handled by the Associated
Press, an agency which editors have come to trust implicitly
and which is ready to assume responsibility. Regardless of

clared the story impossible, newspapers continued to publish
the event until an actual unmasking occurred.
Another point of interest is the way in which newspapers
continue to perpetuate such ancient medical superstitions
as, for example, the belief that prenatal impressions of the
mother may mark the child. There are, of course, books of
instruction for prospective mothers which suggest that they
visit the Art Institute and gaze upon beautiful paintings
and sculpture in order that the forthcoming progeny may
resemble Venus de Milo or the god Adonis. But there is no
basis in scientific fact for such a belief. Nevertheless one
frequently sees in his newspaper such items as the follow
ing: from the Modesto, California, News:
A young French woman testifying in an alleged bigamy
case here today said that a month before the birth of her
child, her husband gave her a black eye. The baby was born
with a black eye.
MEDICAL MISTAKES OF NOTED AUTHORS
It is apparent then that one of the great faults in the
reporting of medical news is lack of accuracy in such mat
ters as terminology, spelling, and definition. Another appar
ent fault is the printing of any news item of scientific inter
est without attempting to check in some manner its reliabil
ity or accuracy or conformity with scientific fact. It is clearly
the duty of the writer of a piece of news to verify the spell
ing of the terms he uses, and to make sure that such terms
actually exist and are used in their correct meanings. The
editor shares with him the responsibility for printing a story
that exploits a medical discovery that has no basis in scien
tific fact or that is founded on poorly substantiated evidence.
No doubt, much of the difficulty is traceable to the fact
that newspapers have not been and are not even today
equipped with competent medical men to pass on medical
news. One seems safe in assuming that the newspaper re
ports of medical matters represent the actual knowledge of
the news gatherers and purveyors, largely in the past men

page to literary criticism, from police news to the drama.
Hardly one of our great hedonists has been free of errors
in the medical field. In "The Meadow Lark," Edna Ferber's
short story in the Cosmopolitan, she says of the Muller girl:
She had the short, sturdy fibula of the energetic woman
and seemed to take more steps and to come down harder
than was absolutely necessary.
The fibula is just one of the two bones in the leg, and the
tibia is larger and more important.
Earl Derr Biggers, writing of Charlie Chan in the most
carefully edited Saturday Evening Post, says:
Tait turned and with a firm step crossed the threshold of
the parlor. For a moment he stood, looking about the group
inside. Then he gave a strangled little cry and pitched for
ward onto the floor. Duff was the first to reach him. He
turned the old man over and, with deep concern, noted his
face. It was as blank as that of the dead man in Room 28.
The next instant a young man was at Duff's side, a good-
looking American with frank gray eyes, now somewhat
startled. Removing a small, pearl-like object from a bottle
he crushed it in his handkerchief, and held the latter be
neath the nose of Mr. Patrick Tait.
"Digitalis," he explained, glancing up at the inspector.
"It will bring him around in a moment, I imagine. It's what
he told me to do if he had one of these attacks."
But of course he meant amyl nitrite, used in angina pectoris,
for digitalis is never taken that way.
In "War Nurse," Rebecca West, writing in the Cosmo
politan, said:
There seemed to be somebody with arms around my hips,
dragging me down and down.
Something funny had happened to the room. The shadows
at the end of it were flying down on my face like birds.

Then other people came. I was placed on a stretcher and
carried to some place that I never saw, answered questions
through a fog, was given treatment that made me cry, and
put in an ambulance and driven back to my own hospital,
where they performed an emergency operation.

It had been hanging by a thread and when I lifted the fat

When I say that illness often results from the effort of

mean "mere nervousness." The nervous tension in these
cases may be so terrific as to produce glandular imbalance
and profound disturbances of physiological function that can
result in almost anything. Among the diseases that often
result are asthma, tuberculosis, acute digestive disorders,
defects of eyesight, and a long list of other troubles. Con
sider, for example, the remoter consequences that might
come from such digestive disturbances. It is well known that
some digestive disorders readily lead to duodenal ulcer, and
that duodenal ulcer in turn frequently ends in cancer. Thus
the chain of cause and effect may be a long and tragic one.

MEDICINE AND THE PRESS
MEDICAL MISTAKES OF ARTHUR BRISBANE
Let us consider one of America's confessedly greatest news
paper men whose journalistic jewels are daily syndicated to
millions of readers. The omniscient Arthur Brisbane never
hesitates to comment on any medical subject, and almost in
variably he is wrong. An engineer might admit that the
omniscient one is right about everything except engineering,
or a chemist might grant the authoritative character of the
omniscient Brisbane's remarks so far as they concern every
thing but chemistry. Apparently, omniscient as he is, the
great Brisbane overlooked the criterion established by Albert
Edward Wiggam which defined the recognition of expert
knowledge as one of the marks of an educated man. After
calling attention to the fact that osteopaths were celebrating
a "normal spine week," the omniscient one proceeded:
Osteopaths today take the place of doctors and doctors
cannot do what osteopaths do, because they haven't learned
that in the human body the skeleton is as important as the
steel frame in a skyscraper. It is as dangerous to have a bone
pinching a nerve as it would be to have an iron beam cutting
off an electric light wire, or a water pipe. Mayor Walker, of
New York, on his way west for a rest from overwork, stopped
in Chicago for an osteopathic treatment. Wise mayor.
Shortly after this was published the Hearst papers announced
that Mr. Brisbane did not intend to say that osteopaths take
the place of doctors. Even if he had said that, however, the
item would have been little better. The analogy between
pinching the nerve and an occluded water pipe is a typical
Brisbane analogy. He makes science so simple that his com
ments appeal particularly to the simple-minded. Let us see
what the dispenser of what have kindly been called "Bris-
banalities" does with a matter of medical news! Here is an
example:
Tears are deadly to germs, says an English scientist. One
tear in a test tube with millions of bacteria dissolved them
all. Nature has many ways of protecting the body. There is

salt in tears, and salt is one of the greatest protectors. Salt,
acid, and violent shaking are deadly to germs. When you
sneeze you kill germs, just as you would be killed if an
elephant stepped on you.
There is a specimen of a complete Brisbanism. First, the
statement of an unspecified English scientist, that one tear
dissolves a million germs, absolutely untrue; next, the in
formation that salt is one of the greatest protectors of the
body against germs, also untrue; and then the alarming com
parison of a sneeze to an elephant. That is the real Brisbane
touch.
Again Mr. Brisbane writes:
Science is powerful. It can help you if you will let it. Keep
away from quacks of all kinds, including quacks that think
they can cure you by talking to you about it—unless the
latter makes you cheerful.
Next to X-rays and the surgeon's knife comes cheerfulness.
The energy of the blood destroys cancer in many cases.
Cheerfulness increases blood energy.
There you see how by pure logic, Mr. Brisbane leads us to
the cause and cure of cancer, sought unsuccessfully as yet
by scientists for many years.
And in another issue:
A very long needle is used to inject adrenalin right into
the heart. The adrenalin, made from one of the mysterious
glands of the body located in the pancreas, is injected into
the tissues of the heart itself.
Adrenalin, Mr. Brisbane should have discovered, comes from
the adrenal gland just above the kidney, and has nothing to
do with the pancreas in the matter of its origin.
Commenting on the death of President Harding, the in
spired one said:

While your temperature is above normal, take nothing
but water —plenty of it—and your temperature will come
down probably.
But Mr. Brisbane never hesitates. Here Arthur takes it for
granted that a Mongolian idiot has something to do with
Chinese parents —but it has not:
Question any experienced obstetrician as to occasional
births of "Mongolian idiots" in his practice, and you learn
that Asiatic blood is never completely absorbed by whites.
The Mongolian idiot appears frequently in Italy, both
parents apparently white, and scientists trace the appearance
to the importation of Mongolian slaves as far back as Marco
Polo, in the thirteenth century.
The omniscient Arthur in a generous mood offers advice
to King George's physicians who apparently have been over
looking something in the way of helping His Majesty. The
item from the New York American, and from all the rest of
the syndicate papers:
King George's condition worries his doctors, puzzled by
his "great fatigue."
The King's blood is tired after months of fighting against
poisonous streptococci.
His blood has lost what military commanders would call
its fighting morale.
After a long campaign a tired army needs fresh soldiers.
The King's blood needs vigorous, fresh leucocytes, and could
get them by transfusion. That so important a step should be
so long delayed is surprising. The King's physicians might
well hesitate to experiment with so illustrious a patient. But
blood transfusion is no longer an experiment, but a scientific
remedy for blood stream infection.

So next Mr. Brisbane discusses surgery of the brain. Pos
sibly ten other men in our country really know something
about it:
At the base of the brain lies the pituitary gland, a puzzle
to scientists, thought by some to be the residence of the
human soul.
Dr. F. J. Evans of Denver has successfully removed a small
tumor, near the pituitary gland, from the brain of a child
four years old.
One-half the skull was removed on one side, one lobe of
the brain lifted, while the surgeon worked through brain
tissue. A fine achievement. . . . One day such operations
will be as common as pruning trees. It is probable that
ninety men in a hundred, at least, could be made mentally
more efficient by brain surgery, especially removing pressure
of the skull and giving important parts of the brain more
room. . . . Put your hand on top of your head. Run it along
the top lightly. If you feel a depression at the top you need
brain surgery to lift the skull top a little and let the brain
do better work. Some doctors will say this is nonsense, but
that is what all doctors past forty said when Harvey
announced the circulation of the blood, driven by the heart.
It seems that alcoholic wines are different from other alco
holic beverages:
Mussolini forbids intoxication which means more in Italy
than forty constitutional amendments would mean here. But
Mussolini allows his Legislature to decide that the mild and
rare drunkenness caused by drinking natural Italian wines,
does not count. Only hard liquor drunkenness is to be
punished.
To prohibition that seems absurd, but it is not quite
absurd scientifically. Natural wines, no matter how much
you drink, do not produce delirium tremens.
Champagne, of course, is not included among natural
wines and is about as bad as whisky with the additional dis
advantage of completing the process of fermentation in your
stomach.

MEDICINE AND THE PRESS
"Never feed a fever," says the great maestro:
Secretary Good's relapse, coming after optimistic reports
from his doctors, reminds you that NO FOOD should be the
rule in cases of fever indicating a toxic condition.
Secretary Good's temperature was high, his body was fight
ing desperately against poison, and eliminating it.
"Then," you read, "he took nourishment for the first
time."
He took nourishment, and immediately his condition
changed for the worse. It did so inevitably. The body cannot,
at the same time, absorb nourishment and eliminate poison.
One task is enough, for a man low in strength.
Doubtless the usual course was followed. The patient is
feeling a little better. Those that love him are distressed
because he has had no food for several days.
Food is given, when it should be sternly withheld, and the
relapse comes, the unnecessary and very hard work of diges
tion and food assimilation having been added to a body
already overworked.
Doctors, too often, yield to family anxiety, based on the
foolish belief that a man, fighting poison in his blood, needs
food "to keep up his strength." He needs water, rest, quiet.
Food is only more poison, and many that call themselves doc
tors do not know it.
Any man in average condition can live on water for twenty
days or more, without serious injury. Remember that, if
some one tries to feed you, when you have high fever, or any
indication of a septic condition.
There is danger, it seems, in looking too closely at cock
tails:
Professor Guillain, of the University of Paris, says, truly,
that more people kill themselves with cocktails than with
pistols, shotguns, knives, gas, and poison.
That France and Britain should have copied our worst
form of alcoholic poison, says little for their intelligence, but
in both countries, only the worthless froth of the population
drinks the mucous-membrane and kidney destroyers.

Dip your handkerchief in a cocktail, apply it to your eye
ball, and you will know what a cocktail does to the lining of
your insides.
If French and British cocktails shorten life, made with real
spirits, ask yourself what bootleg liquor must do to the
American interior.
Arthur now begins to cogitate on the facts of life:
The women's air race from the Pacific Ocean to Cleveland
was saddened by the death of Miss Marvel Crosson, a coura
geous and admirable young woman.
For the present such races should be confined to men.
Their death is less important.
When such a woman as Miss Crosson is killed, there is no
knowing what brilliantly useful men and women may, in her
death, have been deprived of their chance of life.
Of course, there was the immaculate conception:
A New York court sets free individuals arrested on a
charge of teaching birth control. That was not the "set-up"
when the people were arrested. But public opinion caused a
change.
Temporarily it is decided that the woman, not some
gentlemen with theories, may decide how many children the
woman shall have.
The idea that God wants a sickly woman with six or seven
sickly children to have another sickly child isn't compli
mentary to divine wisdom. Besides, all the birth control in
the world could not prevent it if the Lord willed it. He is
omnipotent.
Sugar, it seems, makes heat but not fat:
This country, once the great sugar-consuming nation of
the world, now eats less sugar than it needs, A GREAT
DEAL LESS, as shown in the investigation ordered by Earl
D. Babst, head of the American Sugar Refining Company.

with sugar, as was shown in the big war, are nations partly
starved.
Australia uses, per capita, eighteen pounds of sugar more
than the United States, and New Zealand uses fifteen pounds
a year more than the United States.
This is due in part to the folly of women trying to get
thin, told by ignorant specialists, "Sugar will make you fat."
Sugar will NOT make you fat. On the contrary, it will
supply heat and burn up waste tissue.
So it seems also that sunshine prevents cancer, which is
just Mr. Brisbane's notion:
Proof that the complete costume of modern woman, in
cluding dress, stockings, shoes, and underwear, may weigh
as little as 24 ounces causes the virtuous to grieve. But, even
as woman in her changing moods cuts off her dress at top
and bottom, may be comfortable. The low-necked dress is
partially justified by this fact, to which your doctor will tes
tify. Cancer attacks women more often than men, and cancer
of the breast, dreadfully frequent in civilized countries, is
quite unknown among female savages that wear no clothing
above the waist. Sunshine seems to keep cancer away.
Not only diagnosis, but prognosis and treatment comes
from the noted specialist:
Mussolini, as was surmised, is suffering from ulcers in the
duodenum, the short intestine, into which the stomach
opens. That can be cured if the walls of the intestine have
not been eaten through.
Ten days' fasting and a good course of saline cathartics
will discourage and clear out the Llambia bacilli. Half a
pint of sour milk, soured with the Metchnikoff bacillus, plus
careful living, will do the work and keep things right.
The hemorrhages in Mussolini's case are the dangerous
signs. A disease like his killed Napoleon at St. Helena. But
in Napoleon's case depression and despair did half the work.
Mussolini has many interesting things to live for, and prob
ably will live.

The vitamins, ah! the vitamins!
What are vitamins? We know that we can't live without
them, that they cure rickets in children, what foodstuffs con
tain the various vitamins, and scientists have just discovered
that two of them, vitamins A and B, give off some kind of
strange radiation. Rats deprived of certain necessary vita
mins, have no children. Deprived of other vitamins, they
starve to death, although supplied with abundance of food.
Three important things we possess, without knowing what
they are, electricity, vitamins, and the soul of man.
And occasionally Arthur lapses in his grammar, as he tells
what happened to Eastern visitors in the Golden West:
Westerners live cheerfully under conditions that would
appall some in the East.
While fishing on the Klamath River, Mr. Clark stopped
with an old farming couple, ioo miles from a railroad. They
had ten cows and sold $700 worth of milk a year. Visiting
tourists yielded about half as much as the ten cows.
And then he expresses himself further on cancer:
Dr. Boris Sokoloff of St. Louis proves to the Pasteur Insti
tute in Paris that lactic acid can be useful against cancer.
Twenty-seven per cent of cancerous rats were completely
cured by injections of lactic acid and cancerous growth
arrested in the remaining 73 per cent.
The value of lactic acid and the energetic lactic bacilli is
not fully appreciated. Doctors should experiment with the
introduction of lactic bacilli directly into the lower, intes
tinal tract, instead of relying on the bacilli to find their way
safely through the destructive juices of the stomach, into the
duodenum and onwards.

MEDICAL ADVERTISING
AND PROPAGANDA
"You manufacture, with the aid of unguents, a false bead of hair, and
your bald and dirty skull is covered with dyed locks. There is no
need to have a hairdresser for your head. A sponge, Phoebus, would
do the business better." —Martial: Epigrams, Book VI, Ep. 48.
Only
a little more than a century has passed since the time
when the simple announcement that a piece of goods
was for sale at a certain price sufficed to make it known to
the purchasing public. Today, the sale of most commodities,
luxuries, and services is the result of a highly organized,
intricate campaign. Our thoughts, our beliefs, our food, our
clothing, our pleasures, and our government are controlled
by propaganda. The word, originally of wholly evil con
notation, now represents all of the various forces that may be
brought to bear to influence public opinion. Five years ago,
Mr. Bruce Barton, who did so much to popularize the Bible,
at least briefly, said to me in a conference in New York:
"The medical profession has the greatest message to deliver
for the good of mankind, and it is the one group which has
failed to avail itself of the power of advertising for promot
ing that good." I tried to convince Mr. Barton that the
medical profession had done more than its share in the way
of philanthropy and that education of the public in health
by means of paid advertisements was the duty of the state, of
the press, and of industries generally. Mr. Barton's main
business is not religion but advertising—he is a great author

ity in the field of propaganda, and I fear I left him un
convinced.
As early as 1843 a leader in the field of advertising noted
that pain or the fear of pain had the greatest appeal to
mankind, and that for this reason medical advertising, in
cluding the announcements of patent medicines, took most
of the space in the press. He pointed out also that vanity
had psychologically the next strongest appeal and that the
advertisements of beauty products followed closely after
those of medicines and doctors in their ability to command
public interest. With the beginning of the Twentieth Cen
tury and with the introduction of modern propaganda, con
ditions changed. The coming of anesthetics and of modern
medical science, the education of the public as to the fallacies
of patent medicine advertisements, the development of
something in the nature of ethical standards for the press,
and, above all, the recognition that propaganda could change
the habits of thought, of action, and of living of a nation,
have worked tremendous changes.
Propaganda—the word is of ancient lineage, going back
to the first great Catholic Board for propagating the Faith —
today includes all that was included in its earlier meaning,
rather than paid advertising alone. Of the methods used
more will be told later. However, in a country noted for
commercial efficiency, the direct advertising methods have
been developed far beyond the methods of insidious propa
ganda. Advertising today commands the highest priced
writers and artists; its directors are the very molochs of com
merce; it speaks and the whole world listens.
THE COST OF ADVERTISING
Today the advertising expenditure in the United States
totals approximately $1,502,000,000, of a total national ex
penditure of ninety billions. This figure represents about
one-half as much money as is spent annually for preventive
medicine and the care of disease. Of the money distributed
for advertising, the newspapers in 1927 took $690,000,000;
direct-by-mail appeals, $400,000,000; magazines, $210,000,

ooo; billboards and outdoor advertising, $75,000,000; busi
ness and trade papers, $75,000,000; premiums, programs
directories, and similar places of advertisement, $25,000,000;
streetcar cards, $20,000,000; and the radio, just in its infancy,
$7,000,000. The materials most widely advertised in the
period from 1922 to 1927 were automobiles, toilet articles,
foods, beverages, and tobacco. In 1927 these constituted 65
per cent of the total national advertising in newspapers in
forty-nine large cities. Foods, toilet goods, household goods,
automobiles, and accessories accounted for 51.3 per cent of
all magazine advertising in 1927. The rapid growth of the
radio business and of the electrical refrigerator business was
stimulated by the heaviest expenditures for advertising ever
made by any investments. The manufacture for which the
greatest increases in advertising took place from 1921 to
1927 were radio sets, electric refrigerators, automobile equip
ment, foods, toilet articles, silverware, clocks, and watches.
The sale of such goods is proportionate to the amount of
money spent in propaganda and advertising.
The entire nature of the life of the American people has
been modified by the appeals made through propaganda.
Consider, for instance, food and clothing. A human being
cannot possibly eat much more than 3,500 calories day after
day. It is possible for most of us to maintain our weight
satisfactorily under ordinary conditions with well under
3,000 calories. When more money becomes available for
food, one does not buy more food but begins to vary the
nature of the products that are taken. As a result of the fact
that the American people had more money to spend for food
during the past five years, through the development by
experts in chemistry and nutrition of new types of food, and
because vast sums were spent in exploiting foods, a great
change has come in the diet of our people. Package foods
have multiplied in number and in variety. The farina, whole
wheat, and oatmeal of a past generation now come to us in
hundreds of forms—mixed, inflated with air, shot from a
cannon, half-cooked, wholly cooked, irradiated, twisted,
straightened, and modified indeed in every possible way to

tongue, to the sense of smell, to sight, and to hearing.
Actually every factor has been studied that might possibly
make for increased appeal to the epicure. For this the Ameri
can people pay and pay heavily, and a large part of what
they pay goes to the advertising that promotes these foods
to the purchaser. Today the average man eats about one
thousand calories less per day than he used to eat. He pays
more for it. These changes have caused consternation in
many great industries which now undertake propaganda to
overcome them. The subject might be carried further to show
how the package goods developed the chain store and vice
versa but this would carry us far afield.
CLOTHING AND PROPAGANDA
The clothing of men and of women has changed consid
erably in the past ten years. Changes in fashion are not
extraordinary, and great tomes have been written describing
modifications in human wear from generation to generation.
The last ten years have seen, however, some of the most re
markable changes in fashion that ever afflicted humankind.
The results of these changes have been such as to shake
to their foundations some of our greatest industries. It has
been said that Americans will not raise anything but cotton
and will wear anything else. Early in the present decade,
furs and fur-trimmed garments and short skirts became the
vogue. The coming of the short skirt demanded silk hosiery.
At the same time, the shoe trade began to develop novelty
styles, and fashion decreed that shoes must match the dress.
Rayon silk, which had formerly been merely a curiosity,
became the established material for underwear. In 1926, 36
per cent of the sales of women's underwear, including vests,
bloomers, step-ins, union suits, slips, nightgowns, and other
garments more or less unmentionable, were made of rayon;
31 per cent of silk, and 33 per cent of cotton. As a result,
there occurred a tremendous depression in the woolen and
worsted industries, and the manufacturers of cotton stock

ings went into bankruptcy. For this propaganda was re
sponsible, and the connection has been traced directly.
A few years ago, the producers of velvet were faced by a
tremendous depression in the use of that material. A con
ference was held, and it was determined to spend money for
propaganda. Agents were sent to Lyons where silk is manu
factured and to Paris, where the celebrated designers were
informed of the situation and suitably dealt with. As a
result, Worth and designers of equal fame began to develop
gowns, cloaks, and other feminine accessories of velvet as
the mode for the coming season. The wife of the President
of the United States suddenly appeared in a velvet hat. This
fact was widely commented on in the press. Newspaper
articles began to appear on the women's pages announcing
that fickle fashion had changed to velvet. The manufacturers
of chopped or ready-made dresses who copy the Paris
fashions began ordering thousands of bolts of velvet. The
shop girls, clerks, and all of the group known as the lower
middle class began to buy velvet gowns for evening wear
and even for day time. The velvet business increased tre
mendously, and the depression was temporarily allayed.
THE CRAZE FOR SLENDERIZATION
A few years ago a craze for slenderization swept the
United States. The corset industry was ruined. A manu
facturer who developed boyish form brassieres made millions
and expanded his factories to meet the demand. The pro
ducers of white flour and sugar felt the depression. In several
large cities, hygienists noted that the rate of tuberculosis for
adolescent girls and for young women began to increase.
Here is a disease definitely associated with malnutrition. The
response was prompt. Again propaganda was brought into
the picture to influence public psychology. The Paris de
signers who had decreed lean models, short skirts, and a
modicum of trimming were prevailed on to decree hips,
trains, and ruffles for the future mode. The manufacturers
of white flour and of sugar began purchasing space in the
press for their advertisements. Great publicity organizations

were designed to promote education through news columns,
editorials, lectures, motion pictures, and the radio. Mr.
Ziegfeld picked larger girls for his chorus and covered them
up. Today the trend is toward bigger and better women, and
toward women more fully clothed. Immediately other in
dustries depending on leanness began to be depressed and
to build propaganda to save themselves. One of the steps
in the reverse propaganda was the promotion of the Holly
wood diets. A critic of movies, Luella Parsons, first pro
moted these diets as having been developed for the movie
colony by a congress of celebrated French and American
physicians. This obviously was pure bunkum. Somewhere
the word emanated that the diet had been developed by a
famous medical clinic. The "Eighteen-Day Diet" was given
tremendous vogue because the Hollywood standard of
beauty in women is the American standard of beauty, and
fat girls do not photograph well. The artists of Hollywood,
if one may call them such, wage constant battles against
avoirdupois. The "Eighteen-Day Diet" began its day. Then
the producers of package foods, of sugar, and of flour again
felt a depression in their trade. The evidence indicates that
pressure was brought to bear on the powers that be in jour
nalism. The advertisements of the food industries, as has
been pointed out, represent one of the largest groups carried
in the press and in the magazines. Suddenly, all of the papers
began to carry articles by the experts on how to gain weight
rapidly, and another depression was delayed.
HALITOSIS AND DYSKINESIA
Increased education of the public as to the facts of physi
ology, anatomy, and hygiene has not disposed wholly of the
old psychology. Among the chief appeals that may be made
to mankind through advertising, the appeals to relief from
pain and the promotion of health, and the appeal to vanity
or the promotion of beauty still loom largely. Thus, the
physician and particularly the hygienist and the dermatolo
gist have become prophets in the land. The promoters of

the physician desired to aid. Perhaps much of this goes back
to the original inspiration that came to Feasley when he
found the word "halitosis" and made a million dollars in a
season for the Listerine company. Immediately the bright
boys of the advertising agencies began thumbing the lexicons
in search of new words to charm the public fancy. The
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company launched "dyskin
esia" as a safe word for constipation; a yeast concern, over
the drawing of a pallid, haggard citizen, said, "Just making
the motions—a victim of cachexia (run-down condition) ."
Dr. Sansum discovered acidosis for the orange growers, and
Listerine, having worn threadbare the sad tale of the wall
flower—"Why wasn't she dancing?" —discovered seborrheic
dermatitis.
In support of advertising claims, millions of dollars are
being spent in research. In a recent visit to the Mellon
Institute I saw experiments being conducted to support
ventilating devices, mattresses, bed springs, gelatin, bran
foods, and what not. The scientific appeals appeared in
the advertisements of 1930. Thus modern advertising is
scientifically grounded and most of the great campaigns of
the current years have been studied by experts who have not
been slow to ask for the evidence on which the campaign
was based. Honesty in advertising has become a national
slogan and better business bureaus throughout the land
enforce the standards.
In the observations thus far set forth, I believe it has
been shown that advertising is doing as much or more to
educate our public than the public schools. But our public
schools are, themselves, constantly swayed by propaganda!
Practically no one who has looked into the situation fails
to realize that the present era of prohibition is the direct out
growth of textbooks loaded with propaganda under the guise
of science which pervaded our schools in the latter part of
the nineteenth century. Not long ago the American Medical

Association was besought by a propaganda bureau against
narcotics to urge the insertion into all the current textbooks
of statements which would no doubt result in the abolish
ing of the right of the physician to prescribe morphine or
cocaine fifty years hence. The political censorship of text
books is not a strange phenomenon. Politics recognizes the
importance of propaganda and wins elections with it. In the
campaign of 1916 Henry Ford advertised under the caption
"Humanity and Your Vote" the reasons that led him to
support President Wilson. The announcement appeared si
multaneously in five hundred newspapers in all parts of the
country. That was at the time when Irving Berlin wrote "I
Didn't Raise My Boy to Be a Soldier," which was followed
shortly after, when the United States entered the war, by that
other peaceful melody, "Oh, How I Hate to Get Up in the
Morning," and also by "Over There."
Obviously scarcely a single field of human thought or
action has not been entered by the advertiser. Today the
advertisement is used as much or more to influence public
opinion as to sell commodities or luxuries. The advertise
ment, rather than the editorial, is the most effective means
of persuading the public to any course of action. Already
the advertisement dominates our scenery, our literature, our
entertainment. The beauties of scenery are defaced by miles
of billboards; on the tallest rocks appear the slogans; stories
are written longer so that they will run over among the
advertisements, and it has been suggested that the time will
come when writers will insist on being next to good adver
tising matter, just as advertisers now insist on being next to
pure reading matter. On the radio a Beethoven concerto is
devoted to promoting somebody's oil burner, and a lecture
on evolution is sandwiched between the claims for a health
drink and a cold cure. Children are more familiar with the
Gold Dust Twins, the Campbell Kids, the Victor Dog, the
Carnation Contented Cow, the Borden Eagle, the Bull
Durham and the Camel of the cigaret than with Little Lord
Fauntleroy and Black Beauty. There is an anecdote of the
prayer of a modern little girl. "Oh, Lord, make me pure,"

she said. "Not 99.44% pure like Ivory Soap, but absolutely
pure like Royal Baking Powder."
Thus propaganda has pervaded politics, government, edu
cation, art, and science. Social service and charity, today or
ganized virtually as big business, do not hesitate to avail
themselves of propaganda in the business of doing good. A
great portion of the funds accumulated for charity and for
philanthropy is paid out to the newspapers and magazines
for advertisements planned to raise more money. The man
agers have found that the advertisements get results that can
not be had in the modern state of our civilization in any
other way. The churches, deserted because of the more saga
cious appeals of the movies, the golf courses, and the baseball
games, buy advertising space to attract the faithful. News
papers, anxious to sell space, arrange for public-spirited citi
zens who like to see their names in print, to pay for these
advertisements in the promotion of good.
A study of advertisements is the best route to follow in
tracing the history of any of the human activities during the
last twenty-five years. A quarter of a century ago The
Journal of the American Medical Association showed that
the vast majority of the products advertised were drugs; then
came books, then apparatus, and finally foods. Today foods
equal, if not surpass, drugs in the amount of space sold, and
books follow closely thereafter. The years see the gradual
introduction of new devices for accurate measurement, of
mediums for the growth of bacteria; they see the rise and
fall of the vaccine; the coming of radium and of the ultra
violet ray; they see the appearance of insulin, of liver ex
tract, of arsphenamine, and of scarlet fever antitoxin. If you
would see the real, enduring progress of medicine during
the past twenty-five years, study the advertisements. It is
simpler than surveying the original contributions.

the advantage of the practice of medicine. True, the Ameri
can Society for the Control of Cancer, the National Tuber
culosis Association, the American Child Health Association,
the National Health Council, the American Heart Associa
tion, and innumerable similar organizations are devoted to
propaganda. However, compared to the type of effort and
the results achieved in the field of commerce, the best of
their work is amateurish. They simply do not have the funds
to purchase advertising space or efficient propaganda in
quantities sufficient to make their voices heard among the
shouting for public attention. They seek free time on the
radio, free space in the press, free public speakers. Wherever
social effort turns in its propaganda, it finds itself in con
flict with the interests. Consider the difficulties of the editor
of a newspaper when he surveys the publicity material that
comes to him. Thus Salmon points out in "The Newspaper
and the Historian":
The press has a free hand in some of its campaigns for
public health—flies, rats, mosquitoes, and caterpillars are
not commercialized and campaigns against them are univer
sally popular. But the press suffers a heavy handicap when
it attempts to improve other conditions that militate against
the health of the public. Efforts to secure pure milk may run
counter to milk dealers and to the Grange; proposals to
improve the water supply come into collision with the tax
payers; epidemics must not be reported because they reflect
on the boards of health and diminish the out-of-town trade;
news of the bubonic plague must be suppressed because its
publication will interfere with travel; disgraceful living con
ditions in congested districts must be ignored because the
tenement houses are the property of wealthy residents; the
results of accidents must be minimized because they reflect
on the railroads, or on important local manufacturing indus
tries, or on the large department store; danger from fire in
buildings where many persons are employed must not be
dwelt upon because the owners are influential citizens;
advertisements of patent cure-alls must not be rejected be
cause they make widely known the home town where they
are manufactured; a clean-up week must not be urged

because it is opposed by the board of public works; exposure
of filthy conditions behind the scenes in restaurants will
result in boycotting the restaurants by the public and in boy
cotting the exposing newspapers by the restaurants; advocacy
of free clinics may incur the displeasure of the medical pro
fession; the premature announcement of discoveries in medi
cine or in surgery may bring only ridicule on a paper
overzealous to publish.
In all of this discussion, I have not been so naive as to
imagine that individual physicians, individual clinics, indi
vidual universities, and other medical and scientific organi
zations have failed to realize the value of propaganda for
promotion. At the beginning of the twentieth century, a
noted surgeon began to appear regularly in the press in pub
licity relative to his surgical accomplishments. He admitted
shortly before his death that ninety per cent of his practice
came to him directly from the public as a result of such
exploitation. Another surgeon, having been induced by
proper representatives to discontinue his direct contacts with
publicity, admitted shortly thereafter that the effect on his
practice had been prompt in its depression.
ADVERTISING AND PRACTICE
A great clinic, if properly organized, must have its pub
licity department. Representatives of the clinic must appear
regularly at all important medical meetings, to read papers
on investigations. Motion pictures revealing the work of the
clinic must be sent broadcast to the meetings of county med
ical societies. Interviews with the leaders must be given
freely, and they must cultivate a journalistic sense so as to
make statements sufficiently fantastic to catch the first page
and sufficiently scientific to avoid too great condemnation by
medical colleagues. The discoveries made by the research
workers who are contentedly toiling in their cubbyholes
must be acclaimed and exploited by the "contact men" as
they travel about throughout the land. In this way, the name
of any clinic may be brought prominently to the people.
I say "may be"; perhaps I should say "has been!"

No one realizes better than I, however, how wholly in
efficient from the commercial or professional advertising
man's point of view has been the propaganda for scientific
medicine and particularly for the individual practicing
physician. Let us assume that a really dynamic public re
lations counsel—for such is the title of a great authority on
propaganda—were employed by organized medicine to pre
sent to the public the ability of the family physician to
diagnose and treat rheumatism. The public, we will assume,
is not especially interested in either rheumatism or phy
sicians.
PROMOTING RHEUMATIC CURES
Rheumatism, or inflammation of the joints, or pain in the
back or muscles, which is the popular conception of the
term, is a common, painful disease. The condition is chronic,
and as with most chronic disorders, patients are eternally
hopeful. Remissions occur and patients are likely to feel that
each new treatment is bringing relief. Indeed, the chiro
practors, osteopaths, faith healers, and others who depend
largely on the power of suggestion, can, for these reasons,
cite their quota of benefited and cured cases and produce the
testimonials to substantiate the citations. Let us assume that
the organized medical profession wished to increase greatly
the practice of the individual physician, particularly as re
lates to the treatment of rheumatism, and devoted a suf
ficient sum of money to propaganda for that purpose.
Various leaders of the profession would prepare articles
for the press calling attention to the menace of rheumatism
and emphasizing its frequency and painful character. Some
twenty or thirty syndicated health columnists would be asked
to cooperate by devoting their columns to a similar purpose.
Syndicated editorial writers would be visited, provided with
the facts, and urged to awaken their readers. The matter
would be discussed with the business departments and then
with the editorial departments of leading weeklies and
women's magazines. Interviews would be secured with Henry
Ford, Jimmie Walker, Bishop Manning, and others of similar

repute who speak promptly, if not authoritatively, on most of
the affairs of mankind. Arthur Brisbane would be asked to
discuss the relationship of rheumatism to the Pharaohs of
Egypt and he would emphasize that rheumatism is a menace
to mothers —and who has not had a mother? The Associated
and the United Press would circulate the interviews to the
most remote hamlets and townships. Everyone would re
member remote twinges of pain and would be flattered to
think that he was suffering with the disturbance that had
aroused the interest of Mr. Ford and Mr. Brisbane.
Publicity organizations which devote their entire efforts to
securing publicity for various movements would begin their
work. News items about cases of rheumatism among noted
and notorious people would be furnished to editors and they
would assemble them in special columns so that rheumatism
would loom much larger in the public eye than it actually
is. The procedure was followed by our editors last year in
connection with juvenile suicides, and is regularly followed
in connection with motor accidents. The Sunday magazine
sections would appear with lurid pictures and highly adjec-
tived articles about the manner in which rheumatism caused
the downfall of Grecian and Roman civilizations. Mr. Irving
Berlin would produce a song called the "rheumatic blues,"
which jazz orchestras would feature on the radio. Victrola
records would appear overnight. Dances would appear in the
Scandals and in the Follies, and when the girls stood on their
heads and the skirts toppled downwards it would be discov
ered that they spelled "rheumatism." A movie called Her
Dangerous Love would reveal a woman who sacrificed her
life for a man with rheumatism. Red Grange would explain
how rheumatism has interfered with his success since leaving
Illinois. Noted ladies like "Peaches" Browning and Fanny
Ward would be photographed with their skirts raised suf
ficiently to reveal the locus of rheumatism in the knee joint
and an arrow would point to the spot of inflammation. The
manufacturers of drugs for the relief of pain, of ointments
used as counterirritants, of hydrotherapeutic devices, of heat
lamps, and of diathermic apparatus would buy space in

which rheumatism would be fully discussed. Gradually the
interest and the fear of rheumatism would accumulate. Then
billboards and streetcar cards would shout rheumatism on
every side, and sky writers would point the word in the
heavens.
At last the American people would be "rheumatism-
conscious." The organized medical profession, having held
its own connection with the campaign secret until the psy
chological moment had arrived, would launch its advertise
ments. Full pages would be taken in the press to emphasize
the main points that had been brought out in the pre
liminary campaign, and the public would be urged to go to
the places listed where, for a certain price at a certain time,
a proper diagnosis and treatment could be had. Certainly
they would flock by thousands, for propaganda never fails
unless it conflicts with fundamental human instincts. Even
with these it can be temporarily successful.
The campaign described has been purposely exaggerated,
but for every item or step that has been mentioned adequate
evidence can be produced to reveal its use in some campaign
already before the American public. By such methods
Madame Helena Rubinstein took a pot of cold cream, made
according to the formula of a Polish physician, and ran it
into millions of dollars. Her subject was beauty and she had
something definite to sell.
Furthermore, the example itself is not such a bad selection
for a propaganda, if one should really be made. Rheumatism
must have competent diagnosis and differential diagnosis. In
Vienna, because of the importance of the problem of rheu
matism, three great centers for rheumatic patients have been
established in the three largest hospitals cooperating with
the Krankenkassen. In the outpatient departments attending
to patients for the Krankenkassen, extensive physical thera
peutic departments have been installed. At all the great spas
and resorts the Krankenkassen have established special de
partments for the care of rheumatism. In England one sixth
of the disability of workmen is found to be due to rheumatic
disease which costs annually about ten millions each year in

sick benefits and the loss of eighteen million working days
per year. For Berlin it was estimated that the number of
rheumatic patients who are members of the Krankenkassen is
seven and one-half times as large as the number of tuber
culous patients. Nevertheless, the propaganda against tu
berculosis is tremendous; the money spent in study and
education concerning tuberculosis is in millions as con
trasted with paltry thousands devoted to rheumatism. But
shall we have a similar propaganda concerning every disease?
In a survey of the trend of medical practice I emphasized
my belief that the care of public health in the mass was the
duty of the public health officials, and that preventive medi
cine as applied to the individual must remain the work of
the individual physician, if the latter is to survive for the
future. Thus one of the chief duties of the public health
official will become the making of suitable propaganda for
the scientific practice of medicine and the devotion of public
funds to this purpose. It is encouraging to see the health
officer of New York advertising the prevention of diphtheria
by toxin-antitoxin and to see the buses on Fifth Avenue
carrying signs urging the people to go to their family physi
cians for this service. It is encouraging to see seven great
philanthropic organizations in New York cooperating to
advertise in the New York Times, urging people to go to
their family physician for periodic physical examinations. It
is encouraging to see the great pharmaceutical houses edu
cating the public regarding the progress of preventive medi
cine and urging the people to go to their family physicians
for advice and the application of established methods. Thus
scientific medicine is being helped by propaganda. The
propaganda is powerful, efficient, and costly, and the physi
cians are not being asked to devote their own funds to
purchase advertising space primarily for the good of the
public.
There exists among the public, the advertising agencies,
and the press generally a strange notion as to the principles
of medical ethics and their application to advertising. The
Principles of Medical Ethics say wisely:

It is unprofessional to procure patients by indirection
through solicitors or agents of any kind, or by indirect adver
tisement or by furnishing or inspiring newspapers or maga
zine comments concerning cases in which the physician has
been or is concerned. All other like self-laudations defy the
traditions and lower the tone of the profession and so are
intolerable.
Here is nothing which will prevent a county medical society
from engaging in group advertising to warn the people away
from cultists, to educate the public as to the advantages of
scientific medicine and the dangers of one-track systems of
healing. Great advertising agencies, urging such advertise
ments on county societies —and many county, as well as a
few State societies, have purchased space for such purposes —
point out that cultist groups, including osteopaths, magnetic
belt promoters, and even Christian Scientists, take space in
the newspapers to promote their wares. The Christian
Science Committee on Publications is no doubt the most
efficient organization ever developed to combat unfavorable
publicity. Until the present year, it has fought an almost
invariably successful battle. The fallacy of the advertising
agencies' argument should be obvious. If the advertising of
the cultist is unscientific and against the best interests of the
community, the cure for the situation is for the newspapers
to refuse their advertising, not for the medical profession to
combat the advertising by buying space in opposition. The
medical profession should not give up its principles; the
advertising agencies and mediums should acquire more prin
ciples.
Propaganda for anything will succeed temporarily, but if
it is opposed to fundamental human instincts or if it is
untrue the facts become known and the repercussions are
serious. In all the campaigns for carrying preventive medi
cine to the public which we in the headquarters of the
American Medical Association have supervised, we have in
sisted on limitation to those methods which were fully
established as efficient and harmless. The results have been
favorable and there have been no serious repercussions.

MEDICAL ADVERTISING AND PROPAGANDA
Propaganda is a most potent force, used today to control
practically every phase of human thought and action. Med
icine has but trifled in its employment, whereas the possi
bilities of more extensive and proper use of established
technics might yield great good to the advancement of
medical science, the good of the medical practitioner, and,
above all, the health of the public. The philanthropies
in the field of medicine, the corporations engaging in medi
cal practice, are using propaganda far more efficiently than
it is used by organized medicine. Indeed, the old inhibitions
are strong, and organized medicine has not yet determined
how far it wishes to go in opposing unsound propaganda in
the field of social medicine with its own point of view. The
choice must nevertheless be made. The opinion of the
public is being established for it by teachers who have
studied the situation and who realize how the opinion of
the public is formed. If the medical profession is to have
any part in controlling public opinion, it must accommodate
itself to the situation and use the forces that are being mus
tered by the opposition. Through the publication of its
own health magazine, through its contacts with the press,
through its association with the great commercial interests
allied to medical practice, through cooperation with many
social services and philanthropies of high leadership, organ
ized medicine is beginning to avail itself of the powers of
propaganda for its own and for the public good. But the
situation demands far more consideration by organized
medicine than it has yet had.

PSYCHOANALYTICAL CHARLATANS
"Every doctor must have human understanding but the psychotherapist
needs it to an unusual degree and besides this he must be a natural
leader. For in this realm the relationship between doctor and patient
is particularly close. In this condition the patient is particularly
lonely, frightened and weak and needs a strong guide. Psychotherapy
is mental guidance." —Henry E. Sigerist, "Man and Medicine."
Significantly,
in his book on mental healers, Zweig
chooses as the three outstanding names in this field
Mesmer, Mrs. Eddy, and Sigmund Freud. In previous chap
ters I have shown the gradual evolution of faith healing
from the time of Paracelsus through Mesmer and Mrs. Eddy
to all of the charlatans as well as to the scientific psycho
therapy of modern times. Whenever any discovery is made
in science it is used, promoted, and exploited not only by
scientists who pursue investigations for the advancement of
knowledge and who adapt the discovery to the treatment
of ailing man, but also by charlatans who take advantage
of the public interest and, with little or no knowledge,
emphasize those factors which appeal particularly to human
weakness.
It would be folly to deny that the work of SigmUnd
Freud is one of the most fundamental contributions ever
made to the happiness of mankind. It would be equally
fallacious to assert that it has been an unmixed blessing.
Out of the doctrines of Freud has come inspiration for an
intensification of the public's interest in the mental aspects
of sex gratification —an interest which innumerable quacks
now promote for their personal gain.

PSYCHOANALYTICAL CHARLATANS
THE RISE OF FREUDIANISM
The human mind is, unfortunately, so constituted that
but few persons ever learn careful judgment; most align
themselves promptly on one side or another of every thought
or conception thrown into the field of conversation or
controversy, and are then ready to offer up their life's
blood, if need be, in defense of the views that they have
adopted. The pendulum of thought is then never still but
always toward one extreme or another, the pull upon it of
the enthusiasts on either side being far greater than the
pull at the central point, where the experience of the past
would indicate it more properly belongs. The term "pendu
lum thinking" has been applied to this phenomenon. A
good Freudian, reading this analogy, will immediately find
in the pendulum one symbol and in the central point
another; and I will immediately be convicted of resistances
and other major phenomena in the Freudian category from
which it is difficult even for so serious and careful a person
as myself to escape.
The Freudian doctrines perhaps originated with Breuer
in 1880 and definitely came upon the psychologic scene
in 1894, apparently after Sigmund Freud had spent a brief
period of study with Charcot, noted French psychiatrist.
Whether for reasons of internationalism or perhaps because
of simple jealousy, the French scientist, Janet, who seems to
have been simultaneously a pupil, has never been quite
able to forgive Freud the development of this new school
of thought. One cannot call it psychology, for the standard
psychologists have in general repudiated most of it. The
practice of psychoanalysis as psychotherapeutics is properly
the practice of medicine but the invasion of the field by
hordes of quacks has made its very name anathema to most
reputable psychiatrists. The educators have found the sub
ject most thrilling in its application to the routine dullness
of the educator's ordinary life. Hence it is that the finest
blossom of this tropical plant is its relationship to the care
of the growing child and its use for delving into the mind

of the sexually precocious adolescent. In any event, Janet
claims this fragrant offshoot with one hand while he repulses
it with the other in the following reminiscence of the
Freudian visit:
At this time a foreign physician Dr. S. Freud came to
Salpetriere and became much interested in these studies.
He granted the truth of the facts and published some new
observations of the same kind. In these publications he
changed first of all the terms that I was using: what I had
called psychological analysis he called psychoanalysis; what
I had called psychological system . . . he called a complex.
He considered a repression what I considered a restriction
of consciousness; what I referred to as a psychological dis
sociation, or as a moral fumigation, he baptized with the
name catharsis. But above all he transformed a clinical obser
vation and a therapeutic treatment with a definite and
limited field of use, into an enormous system of medical
philosophy —the philosophy of Pansexuality.
Dr. Smith Ely Jelliffe asserts that Janet later repudi
ated these statements. Janet is not, however, the only critic
of the Freudian school who insists that Freud derives largely
from other schools of thought. The difficulty of tracing the
derivation lies in the fact that the Freudian school has
developed an entire nomenclature to facilitate converse
among the elect, much as a group of recalcitrant young
sters adopts a sort of hog-Latin to keep its transactions
away from the juvenile bourgeoisie. Some of the critics
refer to the doctrine of purification of the emotions evolved
by Aristotle. Others mention Mesmer and his healing by
hypnosis. Many insist that the entire system is simply an
elaborate ritual for conveying suggestion without the laying
on of hands. Perhaps the associated technic is sufficient to
make the laying on of hands an extremely elementary process

which is perhaps not directly responsible for carrying on
the functions of human existence that are simple processes
in addition —and yet by the Freudian conception the uncon
scious enters into every human activity. Indeed, all of our
ethics, morality, culture, and civilization are products of its
work. It seems indeed to be the powerful minister behind
the throne who insidiously guides the monarch—the con
scious mind —into any plan that it desires. The unconscious
has been described as a "magic cave where, by psycho
analysis, one can discover anything one puts into it." The
most carefully reasoned presentation of the Freudian uncon
scious in brief form must be credited to Morton Prince,
although Freudians insist that Prince has not passed the
subconscious of Janet. He considers that it embraces only
mental processes that have been repressed from or kept
out of consciousness because intolerable by reason of their
unmoral, unsocialistic, and other characteristics; that for the
most part never have entered awareness and therefore have
been unconsciously and automatically kept apart; that are
essentially of infantile origin and nature, the splitting of the
mind into conscious and unconscious regions having taken
place in the earliest part of childhood, probably in the first
year; that involve the crude primitive instincts; that are pre
dominantly sexual in character; and that, as they, necessarily
like all processes, are dynamic, are sexual wishes. Morton
Prince dismisses these views with the simple statement that
they are not true, not confirmed by methods of research and,
indeed, actually contradicted by scientific observations. Sachs,
viewing the orgy of sexual associations that arises from any
one's unconscious when an adept Freudian disciple becomes
active, blurts out that "what Nature in her wisdom assigned
to the unconscious had better remain there." Yet the Freu
dians would have it that this "Unconscious" is the domin
ating factor in our lives and that not only mental disturb
ances but phenomena such as pain, convulsive seizures, ner
vous coughs, spells, states of anxiety, images of compulsion,
hallucinations, and illusions are simply the symbols by which
this Unconscious reveals itself to the outer world.

FADS AND QUACKERY IN HEALING
Anyone will grant that the human being avoids disagree
able experiences and prefers not to think about them. It may
be admitted that the eye constantly sees, the ear hears, the
hands feel, and the nose smells without positive recording
of the impressions concerned. No doubt, the infant before
arriving at the age of memory or reason is automatically
receiving certain impressions. Then, too, all of us inherit
forms of body structure, perhaps particularly brain struc
ture, which may be concerned in our methods of thought
and action. Certainly the will to survive, the desire to repro
duce, the wish to satiate hunger, are fundamental in man
as in the lower animals. But the Freudians would have it
that these things are the impelling motives and that they
see them about in this Unconscious ever ready to burst
forth against their owner's will. To prevent their eruption,
their owner represses them or holds them down consciously,
and this conflict between conscious and unconscious is the
basis of all sorts of nervous and physical disorders, which
are relieved, as we shall hear later, by psychoanalysis.
The German internist, Bumke, hesitates to accept such a
complicated explanation of the situation. He recognizes that
there is a crossing of several motives in the case of most
human convictions and actions, and that the real reason
for a certain act is not always that which appears most logical
but often one based largely on emotions. "Numerous contra
dictions arise in the life of a person," he says, "and it is these
contradictions that we often discover in a disguised form
in many neurotic individuals. Whoever is acquainted with
the rationality of such an occurrence will, without the aid
of psychoanalysis, have no difficulty in bringing out the
truth and rid the patient from his troublesome complexes."
THE SEX FACTOR IN PSYCHOANALYSIS
As has already been emphasized, the sexual factor looms
largest in the Freudian doctrines. All Freudians are agreed
on the place of the unconscious but they are not so uniform
in their acceptance of the place of sex as the prime factor
in the unconscious. Indeed, many resort to strange evasions

when the critics attempt to fix them definitely on this point.
What was formerly understood by love —namely sexual
love —has been gradually expanded into a new and much
broader usage of that term. The Freudian "libido" embraces
far more than could as notable a lover as Brigham Young.
In the most recent enunciation of Freud himself "we call
by that name the energy (regarded as a quantitative mag
nitude, though not at present actually measurable) of those
instincts which have to do with all that may be comprised
under the word 'love.' The nucleus of what we mean by
love naturally consists (and this is what is commonly called
love —and what the poets sing of) in sexual love with sexual
union as its aim. But we do not separate from this—what
in any case has a share in the name love —on the one hand
self-love, and on the other love for parents and children,
friendship and love for humanity in general and also devo
tion to concrete objects and to abstract ideas. Our justifi
cation lies in the fact that psychoanalytic research has taught
us that all these tendencies are an expression of the same
instinctive activities; in relations between the sexes these
instincts force their way toward sexual union, but in other
circumstances they are diverted from this aim or are pre
vented from reaching it through always preserving enough
of their original nature to keep their identity recognizable
(as in such features as the longing for proximity, and self-
sacrifice) . . . Psychoanalysis then gives these love instincts
the name of sexual instincts, a posteriori, and by reason of
their origin."
The technic of psychoanalysis both as a method of diag
nosis and of cure seems to be essentially simple, yet the
great founder himself insists that one cannot become a
good psychoanalyst without a visit to the fountainhead in
Vienna, that one cannot be a psychoanalyst until one has
been himself submitted completely to the complete process,
and that the fountainhead technic is the only technic. There
exist several tomes in which disciples have endeavored to
describe the technic in detail. But just as chiropractic split
from or derived from osteopathy, so also have a dozen or more

other schools of psychoanalysis derived from the original
school, and new tricks of technic have originated with them.
In a recent promulgation one direct apostle insists that the
average time for an analysis is from six to eight months
with five or six sessions each week. One ritual demands that
the patient lie upon a couch in a dimly darkened office.
There she—and the word falls naturally for it is usually a
feminine patient—begins her long autobiography and there
the psychoanalyst sits—we hope—listening and stimulating
ever more and more juicy revelations.
THE DREAM AND ITS INTERPRETATION
If there is ever a period in which the unconscious is at
its best, that time is when a person dreams. Certainly his con
scious cannot be dominating, because it is impossible when
actually asleep to dream what one wishes. Those who dream
while awake have no difficulty, however, in accomplishing
in their fantasies the things they desire. The Freudians have
it that the dream accomplishes what the unconscious
desires —it is a wish-fulfillment. Obviously the activities of
the personnel involved in the dream are modified not only
by all of the person's past experience, indeed even by his
prenatal state, but also by all recent events and particularly
by events of the day. The good psychoanalyst begins promptly
to delve into the inner meanings of the dreams of his patients.
At this point, frequently the dirty work begins.
During the dreams the censor, that mythical controller
of the complexes, is still active but not so wide-awake, as
when the person concerned is about his daily affairs. How
ever, the censor continues to function sufficiently to cause
the unconscious to adopt disguises for the persons and the
ideas that are exploited in the dream. These symbols of
things and persons have been organized to a certain extent,
but their possibilities are limited undoubtedly only by the
limits of imagination of the psychoanalyst who is interpret
ing the dream. For instance, sex activity may be symbolized
either by flying or falling, by going upstairs or by going
downstairs, by riding, by fighting, by anything. The organs

of sex are symbolized by hundreds, actually thousands of ob
jects, usually of the most ordinary varieties of things occur
ring in daily life. In a dream analyzed by Jung, the patient
dreamed of a certain number. "By adding in an ingenious
way the figures for the year, month, and day of birth of the
patient, of the patient's wife, his mistress, and his two chil
dren," says Dunlap, "the total gave the number, which is
therefore the symbol of the patient's domestic triangle."
Again and again these dream analyses fall into a reductio ad
absurdem, but it remained for S. A. Tannenbaum, in the
Journal of Abnormal Psychology, to investigate one of the
dream analyses made by Freud himself, and to convict the
great master of an apparent deliberate faking of a dream
to prove a point.
It has been urged that psychoanalysis is a scientific method.
Unfortunately, no two psychoanalysts seem to agree in the
interpretation of a dream. In one instance reported in the
scientific literature two analysts differed as to an interpre
tation. The matter was referred to Freud and to Jung, and
two additional interpretations were secured. A scientific
method yields the same result every time. Actually, this
variation of result and this continuous correction of the
experiment to get a result that will fit the picture throws
the method completely out of the scientific field. "When in
interpreting a given phenomenon, as for example, to take
the stock phenomenon, a dream," says Morton Prince, "we
have to apply one or more of the various theoretical mechan
isms, such as conflict, repression, displacement, compromise,
disguisement (to avoid the hypothetical censor) , inversion,
transposition, dramatization, condensation, sublimation, fixa
tion, compensation, etc. —when we have to do more or less
of all this in order to connect an antecedent experience
logically with the dream or other phenomenon under inves
tigation, it is obvious—at least so it appears to me—that the
method falls far short of having that exactness which scien
tific procedure requires, and becomes a source of a large num
ber of possible errors."

SOME SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOANALYSIS
In the dream the complexes find a stage for their dramati
zations. Using the scientific method, the complexes have
been classified. Such conceptions as the (Edipus or "mother"
complex (the turning of the sexual desire of the boy toward
his mother) ; the Electra complex (desire of the daughter
for her father) ; the various perversions of sex desire; narcis
sism; the inferiority and superiority complexes are the talk
of the day among the intelligentsia, the artists, the Green
wich villagers, and the other insecta that thrive in a half-
intoxicated condition in Batik-hung studios where the lights
are low and the tobacco smoke thick enough to cut with a
knife. On the relative importance of these complexes the
psychoanalysts have waged bitter civil warfare. From Freud
have derived the schools of Jung, of Adler, and of a half-
dozen other well known disciples such as Stekel, Ferenczi,
Ernest Jones, and Otto Rank abroad, and Jelliffe, Brill,
White, Kempf, and others in this country.
After Carl Jung of Zurich had studied psychoanalysis un
der Freud he evolved a different conception of the urge that
drives mankind. Whereas the Freudian libido denoted sexual
energy the Jung urge manifests other than sexual activities.
Indeed, Jung conceives of progression which is a striving
forward and regression which would make man go back to
the irresponsibility of infantile and prenatal life. This re
gression, let it be understood, is essentially the Freudian
CEdipus complex. Moreover, Jung is primarily responsible
for the popularity of that delightful form of after-dinner
amusement known as the word association test, which, Dr.
Jelliffe informs me, originated with Wundt and Munster-
berg. In this method of determining the complexes, the
patient receives a list of words and is instructed to respond
to each with the first word that comes into his mind. The
time necessary for each response and the unusual responses
indicate that the person is concealing something because of
a conflict. Among some of the other indicators of the pres
ence of a complex are repetition of the stimulus word, re

sponse to a word previously given, naming some object in
sight, rhyming to the word given, no response, or failure
to reproduce the same response on repeating the experi
ment. Jung is also the formulator of the classification of
mankind into "introverts" and "extroverts," conceptions
which he first introduced in his Psychology of the Uncon
scious and which he has recently expanded into the scope
of a new volume. The introvert withdraws himself from
reality and lives in the realm of thought—a poet, a painter,
a professor. The extrovert is gregarious and a man of action
—probably a traveling man. Finally Jung must be credited
with having taken the new school of thought into high so
ciety. His disciples, particularly in Chicago, have given great
concern to the public prints; he has lectured with great
pecuniary emoluments; his nomenclature runs from the
tongues of the four hundred more glibly than "two no
trump."
THE ADLERIAN SCHOOL
Alfred Adler, major prophet of another offshoot of the
great Viennese school, puts the main emphasis on the ego
instincts instead of on the sex instincts. The dominating im
pulse in life is for power and the urge toward security. The
desire for superiority is a compensation for a feeling of in
feriority that may be based on an actual or a supposed
defect of the body of the person concerned. Neurotic symp
toms represent to him a protest against a constitutional in
feriority or an inferior position in life. For example, hys
terical outbreaks in women are frequently a protest against
the supposed inferior position of women in general. As out
lined by Hunter, the Adlerian conception relates degener
acy, genius, and neurosis in the following manner: The
degenerate succumbs to his inferiority, for his compensation
is unsuccessful. The genius completely compensates for his
inferiority by remolding himself or reality to suit his pur
pose. The neurotic compensates for his inferiority by a fan
tastic creation. He denies reality and compensates in day
dreams or in behavior that does not adjust him properly to

his environment. Such power as he achieves is secured
through sickness by which he compels others to his wants.
The great work of Adler that has reached general accept
ance has been his cooperation with pedagogic methods in
Vienna. He conceives of a large majority of children as dis
couraged, which is of course merely another way of saying
that they suffer with the inferiority complex. The discour
aged child has this discouragement for one of three reasons:
an organic defect, such as deafness, a club foot, a disturbed
digestion, or some similar weakness; because it is spoiled
due to parents having yielded to all of its minor demands,
so that it has learned to lean constantly on others for its
security; or because it is a hated child and conceives of all
of the world as its enemies. Assuming that every child seeks
some goal in life, for all of us constantly strive upwards,
the discouraged child meeting an obstacle makes its escape
by lying, stealing, or some other abnormal conduct. This
psychology makes it a simple matter to excuse criminal ac
tions of all kinds, since obviously responsibility for such
actions must constantly be fixed on circumstance. The peda
gogic method involves a retracing of the history of the child
to the point at which its progress was blocked. It is then
shown the reasons for its attempt to escape and it is pointed
out that the heroic action in striving for the goal is taking
the right path through the obstacle or over it, and not by
evasion. This conception of Adler's is generally accepted as a
major contribution to pedagogy, since it has done much to
correct evil trends in childhood.
When this conception is applied to neuroses in women or
to the criminal actions of adults, it begins to assume the
possibilities of a dangerous cult, since it teaches the doctrine
that the individual is never responsible for his actions. In its
pursuit of the cause of the neurosis, it must perforce lean
heavily upon sex causes which titillate the imagination and
attract the neurotic. It is significant that Heinrich F. Wolf,
one of the chief Adlerian disciples, has just issued a volume
on The Strategy of Masculine Seduction, in which the tech-
nic of the modern Casanova is thoroughly elucidated. To

this volume Adler himself contributes an introduction with
the sophistic argument that the value of such an analysis
will be to make it possible for women to resist such anti
social conduct. The work will also have the advantage, he
suggests, of removing obstructions to love interests, and
thereby prevent neurosis and antisocial conduct. Adler also
remarks naively that whenever he has lectured on human
psychology and has permitted the audience to ask questions,
70 per cent of the questions were concerned with the technic
and problems of love.
The whole conception of defense mechanisms, the build
ing up of psychic compensations, the refuge in fantasy or
heroic dreams of those who are inferior, the notion that one
whose vision is defective compensates for the power by an
acquired delicacy of touch or hearing, was fully expressed
by the Irish bull, that it was a surprising thing that when
ever a man had one leg that was shorter, the other was al
ways longer.
Stekel, one of the most popular writers for the public on
psychoanalysis, unquestionably derives all of his popularity
from his facility as an author in this field. Possessed of a
magnificent imagination, he is never at a loss for a suitable
case to prove his points. Indeed, many Freudians have urged
that he is not averse to using his creative art in developing
suitable case material for such purposes.
Everyone has heard of these major prophets of psycho
analysis. Few know about the vast number of disciples with
slight modifications or individual idiosyncrasies to whom
suitable space might be allotted. In our own country, Kempf
has tried to get a physiologic basis for most of the neuroses
and the mental disturbances, with a view to securing greater
medical acceptance. His psychoanalytic practice is con
fusedly intermingled with much stress on the glands of in
ternal secretion and on the autonomic nervous system.

minor mental incidents of daily life. The Freudians would
have it that the traveling man who tells an obscene story in
the smoking compartment of a Pullman car is merely re
sorting to a form of exhibitionism that takes the place of an
actual display of his sexual proclivities. The person who
makes a slip of the tongue or a slip of the pen does so be
cause he is anxious to conceal his real mental attitude in the
matter concerned. Forgetting, for instance, it is alleged, may
sometimes be due to repression of something which one is
anxious to forget, and probably, in the majority of instances,
a sexual wish. On the other hand, it has been urged by
psychologists who have given much attention to the matter
that persons frequently fail to remember simply because of
a natural condition of disinterest, and perhaps still more
often because their minds are fixed on matters which inter
est them a great deal more. Indeed, Morton Prince asserts
that the whole problem of remembering and forgetting is
subordinate to the fundamental problem of why we remem
ber at all. Such daily incidents of life as repeated washing
of the hands, the Freudians assert, are due to some occur
rence, perhaps in infantile life, in which the hands were
concerned in a sexual catastrophe. Actually a good Freudian,
if there is such an animal in the opposite sense of the word,
seems to be able to find some obscene cause for practically
any action on which a person may fix his attention, or about
which he prefers not to speak. On the other hand, the major
ity of more careful thinkers are inclined to believe that
sometimes we forget because we simply "do not give a
damn."
I have heard Adler say, I have read in the writings of
Freud, and of others in this particular field, that every action
of human kind, individual or social, may be explained by
the psychoanalytic technic. The absolute apotheosis of the
cult of psychoanalysis is perhaps best expressed by Trigant
Burow of Johns Hopkins University in his recent screed on
this topic. He is certain that psychoanalysis will explain
both religious hysteria and war, and he continues:

Our frenzied greeds, our national competition and usurpa
tions rest upon definitely compulsive reactions within the
national consciousness. Our market inflations and our finan
cial depressions are but the fluctuating mental states that
represent the manic and depressive phases of an unstable
social cyclothymia.
The superficial and naive explanations popularly assigned
as the real occasion for these manifestations—such, for ex
ample, as the alleged necessities of territorial expansion,
international commercial competition, the urgency of tariff
readjustment, race prejudice, nationalism, our economic
franchise, the rights of the minority, etc. —all these manifest
symptoms are but the unconscious rationalizations well cal
culated to repress from the social consciousness the real
underlying occasions of our national neuroses. What is called
capitalism, Nordic superiority, bolshevism, fascism, class con
sciousness, one hundred per cent patriotism, industrial
democracy, our fluctuating ratios of monetary exchange —all
these and a thousand more are but mental states which,
instead of being greeted by us as substitutive manifestations
calling for definite analysis and adjustment, are universally
accepted as bona fide expressions, and their latent meaning
remains completely unchallenged in its psychosocial impli
cations.
PSYCHOANALYSIS AND LITERATURE
The criticisms that have been leveled against the develop
ment of psychoanalysis as a department of medicine or as a
healing cult have varied from the simple assertion of Joseph
Collins that the medical profession by and large, the world
over, repudiates Freud, his theory of neuroses, and his sys
tem of therapy to the terrific indictment of Frederick Peter
son that psychoanalysis is a species of voodoo religion charac
terized by obscene rites and human sacrifices. When the
Freudian conception was first launched upon the intelli
gentsia it became the plaything of artists, litterateurs, and
critics. It succeeded in dominating the writing of May Sin
clair and in devastating such merit as existed in the work
of D. H. Lawrence and J. D. Beresford. In this country a

and the early Sherwood Anderson, were enabled to make in
tricate introspective analyses of their own sexual misgivings.
Even the literary intelligentsia, however, are beginning to
line up with the psychologists and the physicians in their
hesitancy to accept absolute Freudian domination. This re
pudiation seems to have resulted in the establishment of the
practice of psychoanalysis by amateurish performers primar
ily perhaps for their personal excitement, but secondarily
for commercial gain. The invasion of the field by such
pseudoscientific writers as Andre Tridon, Harvey O'Hig-
gins, and William Walsh is evidence of the opportunity af
forded for exploiting such literary tripe. Unfortunately,
some physicians have also lent themselves to similar exploi
tation.
PSYCHOANALYSIS AND MEDICINE
The practice of psychoanalysis for the healing of disease
is the point at which it invades the medical field primarily.
Its use in the treatment of disease has been a part of medi
cal practice since the beginning of time. The confessional of
the Catholic Church, relieving thousands of disturbed
minds, as well as every method of faith healing that has ever
existed, including Christian Science, Coueism, autosugges
tion, amulets, charms, incantations, chiropractic, and the
laying on of hands in general, can report hundreds of cures
of persons who are not actually sick. It is, however, an en
tirely different process to apply such methods simply and
directly for healing of neuroses with a full knowledge of
the reason for the application and with a full knowledge of
any organic defects that may exist in the person concerned,
and to use all of the paraphernalia of the charlatan to attract
ladies of leisure and unfortunate victims of sexual aberra
tions into a method of treatment requiring months of time
and tremendous financial outlays.
Worst of all, the majority of good psychiatrists are con
vinced that the orthodox method of psychoanalysis as prac
ticed by the out-and-outers in this field is distinctly wrong
in principle and meretricious in practice; that it degrades

the personality; produces harmful results and is, in general,
indefensible. "One need not be a physician," says a compe
tent authority, "to realize that an infant is suffering from
constipation, nor does it require considerable experience in
life to know that nervous women during a reception will
occasionally put their fingers in their pocketbooks. The in
fant does not do this because it derives pleasurable satisfac
tion, nor does the nervous lady signify a sexual relationship
by her act."
Men of long experience in the psychiatric field are able
to produce numerous instances in which the psychoanalytic
technic has been the prime occasion for a severe disturbance
of mentality by turning a sexual interest into a sexual aber
ration. The careful physician is perhaps even more likely to
be wary of a part of the Freudian technic, because appar
ently the only way the patient has of ridding himself of
some of his most difficult complexes is to transfer them to
the doctor.
The invasion of the field by psychoanalytic amateurs has
finally resulted in setting up defensive reactions among the
psychoanalytic medical practitioners. In Vienna the physi
cians' group demanded that one of the nonmedical psycho
analysts discontinue his practice, although he was certified
by the great Freud himself, and insisted that psychoanalysts
who are not physicians have not the right to treat patients
for disease. A federal ministry of public administration, as
the highest authority, has been called on to consider an
opinion delivered by the leading psychiatrist of Vienna to
the effect that only physicians should treat patients suffer
ing from mental disturbances. In their defense, the lay psy
choanalysts set up the fact that in America psychoanalysis is
not regarded as a branch of medicine, but is considered to
be primarily in the field of pedagogics and spiritual guid
ance. . -
Notwithstanding this defense, the New York Psychoanal
ytic Society was compelled recently to adopt resolutions urg

mental disease be restricted to physicians and that even the

FADS AND QUACKERY IN HEALING
psychoanalytic instruction of specialists engaged in anthro
pology, theology, law, pedagogy, and social service be limited
to the use of this training for the interpretation of prob
lems in the special fields concerned. Furthermore, these
medical psychoanalysts demand that the instruction be lim
ited to those having at least the Bachelor of Arts degree,
and above all, unequivocal evidence of good moral charac
ter.
The Freudian school will not recognize the status of any
one in psychoanalysis unless he has himself been through
the procedure with Freud or his immediate lieutenant. The
great apostle is himself the founder of a school of which he
is the despotic head. It is asserted, as it has been asserted
by many charlatans in other fields, that this is to protect
the method against quackery. On the other hand, a scientific
method is able to stand any type of study or investigation.
The psychoanalysts insist, as do all cultists, on an "all or
nothing" policy. When criticized, they seek escape by eva
sion, yet they urge that in every normal person sexual per
version is latent, and they attempt to classify as erotogenic
every portion of the body that may in some manner be in
volved in sexual pleasure. The use of symbolism has been
exaggerated to a point beyond reason.
The great contribution of Sigmund Freud, as admitted
by all of the critics, has been to attract greater attention to
the processes of the human mind, to stimulate the acceptance
of the mind as such in its relation to disturbances of per
sonality; in other words, to recognize that the study of ob
jective changes in the human body is not sufficient to ac
count for mental aberrations. The psychology of everyday
life, the views regarding the dualism of the human mind,
and its fundamental modifications have been a tremendous
stimulus to psychology and to psychiatry. They have modi
fied pedagogics and have created the new profession of
behaviorist.
The position of Freud in the history of psychology is
secure, but it is not the position that has been assigned to
him either by his friends or his enemies. Psychoanalysis

PSYCHOANALYTICAL CHARLATANS
cannot be said today to be in any sense of the word an
established science —the time may come when it will be
recognized as a significant portion of the science of the
human mind.
THE PRESENT PSYCHOANALYTIC SCENE
Out of the interest in psychology and psychoanalysis of
the last twenty-five years has come a new species of peddlers
of psychologic treatment, known as practical psychologists
or character analysts. Their doctrines are platitudes which
strike the intellect of Homo Americanus with the force of
direct communications from high Olympus. Their appeal is
to the fundamental desires and weaknesses of this same
Boobus Americanus, his love for financial success, social
prominence, and his desire for relief from his vague and
fancied ills. In one conference and for a few pitiful dollars,
these psychologic charlatans, completely uninformed regard
ing true scientific psychology or psychotherapy, attempt to
advise men and women concerning their mental disturb
ances. Sometimes individual conferences follow public
seances held in large halls. A typical example is reminiscent
of the days of Mesmer.
The large auditorium is filled with beautifully gowned
women and a few sopranolike men. There is a subdued hum
of chatter and light laughter. Silently the magnificent ma
roon velour curtains are parted as though by some invisible
genii; the lights become dim. Then there walks—almost
glides —on the stage a man faultlessly attired, his lustrously
brilliantined hair brushed back smoothly from a pallid coun
tenance. The audience is hushed. The professor begins to
speak in sympathetic tones, pouring forth well-rounded bat
meaningless phrases about the perfection of ideality, happi
ness through the sacrifice of the eccentric Ego, the attain
ment to Nirvana through immolation on the pyre of ideal
scientific introspection. He promises youth and health to
those who will believe and study.
And the audience—women, occupiers of one-room kit
chenettes, suffering with the ennui of idleness, their faces

elaborated with artifices in attempt to simulate the long lost
buoyancy of youth—sighs happily as it dreams of the mirage
he brings up before it. Quiet ushers pass along the aisles and
with sibilant whispers distribute cards on which arrange
ments may be made for personal consultations with the pro
fessor at $10 per visit. Thus works the newer quackery—
health and happiness and a little erotic stimulation through
commercialized psychology.
A FEW CHARLATANS
In some of the cheaper tracts sold to the public by our
commercialized press one reads the advertisements of some
of the psychics who are capitalizing this new state of public
interest. There is, for example, C. Franklin Leavitt, born in
1873, graduate of a homeopathic institution in 1896, and
organizer of a medical psychologic society. At one time he
developed what he called the Magnum Bonum Company
which should have been interpreted as the best thing he had
yet thought of for his own profit. This concern published a
magazine called Thought, took full page space in Mr. Ber-
narr Macfadden's medium of education, and promised self-
mastery through understanding. Of course, he also prom
ised rejuvenation and preached optimism. At first he of
fered just a $100 course; this, however, may be had, if the
prospect waits long enough for the full series of follow-up
letters, for $3.50.
Not long since, there appeared in announcements on the
billboards of Chicago and in such newspapers as would
accept the advertisements, statements concerning Lahissa,
the New Teacher. It seemed that the professor, who affected
the appearance of a Hindu yogi, was to lecture in the hall
of the Morrison Hotel and that he would reveal the un
known, unscrew the inscrutable, and offer lessons leading to
success. For a consideration, the professor also promised
private lessons on how to concentrate. The lectures and the
demonstrations were all subtly sexual. It occurred to Mr.
Richard Finnegan, editor of the Chicago Daily Times, to
send one of his best sob sisters for personal consultations

not only with Lahissa but also with a half-dozen other asso
ciated psychoanalytic charlatans. The young lady made her
reports daily in the Times; in a week five of the experts
left town, one of them so hurriedly that he left his newly
purchased Packard as a bonus for the police.
The most remarkable of all of the professors is one Alfred
Ernest George Hall, M. D., Ps. D., M. Sc. D., F. Ps. A. When
the American Medical Association began to look into Hall's
career, it was found that actually he had never graduated
from any college. He was nevertheless, if one believed his
statements, Dean of the American Academy of Psychologi
cal Research, Vice President of the International Society of
Psychological Research, and President of the International
Society of Mental Light. In a typical performance Hall also
duplicated and indeed improved on everything that James
Graham, Mesmer and even Mrs. Eddy had to offer.
In the center of the stage from which he spoke stood a
glorified device for indirect lighting covered with flowers.
On each side of the stage were candelabra with three flicker
ing candles simulating the staff of Neptune. The red and
blue glow of the footlights gave to the lecturer and his staff
a mystical appearance.
In various parts of this country and Canada, Hall pro
pounds utterly filthy and unscientific lectures on sexual sub
jects, describing in the utmost detail, even to the point of
obscenity, every variation of the sexual act and illustrating
his salacious utterances with drawings of male and female
organs in extraordinary juxtaposition. In the small towns
his lectures were given to mixed audiences, some of them
adolescent boys and girls. It was not surprising that Hall
should have been seized by the police in several communities
and that he is today constantly dodging legal actions still
held against him. It is surprising that he is able to go on and
on, as he has done now for half a decade, using all of the
devices of the quack to exploit the unwary.
Between the scientific practitioners of psychoanalysis —
and there are many such —and the outright charlatans,
whose numbers are also considerable, there is a borderland

for the extraordinarily excessive fees that they demand and

in which the old rule of caveat emptor (let the buyer be
ware) must be constantly applied with all of the skepticism
that the human animal can summon to the occasion. It is
sad indeed that those who must make the choice are in many
instances poor, harassed, driven specimens of the genus homo
whose intellects, through sorrow and suffering or through
physical disease, make them quite incapable of summoning
to their defense anything resembling a judicial tempera
ment or anything beyond a hopeful credulity.

XXIV
THE CHOICE OF A PHYSICIAN
"Physicians mend or end us; but though in health we sneer, when sick we
call them to attend us, without the least propensity to jeer." —Byron.
The
physician, if he is the graduate of a reputable medi
cal school, has perhaps been told again and again, by
preceptors and teachers, that his is a profession of service.
No doubt, the example of sacrifices observed in clinic, dis
pensary, and out-patient departments have impressed this
conception upon him even more. With his diploma, he re
ceives an address on high aims and service and a copy of the
Principles of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Asso
ciation. Possibly he lays aside the little book to read after
the celebrations and examinations associated with this period
in his career have ended. Then he embarks on his interne-
ship and, following that, enters medical practice. But he is
hardly likely to consult the booklet of ethics again unless
invited to speak on the subject before some organization,
or until some occasion arises in which he believes his rights
may have been transgressed. Then he sends for a new copy,
only to find in all probability that the things he thought
were there are not really there at all.
The average man believes that medical ethics were devel
oped primarily for the physician, and with but little regard
for the interest of the patient. He believes that the physician
is compelled either by this system or by some legal require
ment to come to every patient every time he is called.
The physician believes frequently that medical ethics de
mand that other physicians treat him at any time and to any

amount without exacting a fee, and not infrequently that
physicians give gratuitous service also to all members of his
immediate family and the families of his more distant
relatives.
He is certain that the principles prevent another physi
cian from "stealing" his patients, and he is not infrequently
of the opinion that the principles of ethics were formu
lated primarily for the protection of the rights of the in
dividual physician rather than for the rights of the group.
In other words, the physician is first and foremost a hu
man being with all of the failings of human beings in other
businesses and in other professions. He is likely, if he is
that kind of man, to think first of "number one." He may, if
he has the instincts of a miser, put receipts above service.
He may, if he is naturally quarrelsome and antagonistic,
be constantly at outs with his colleagues and his patients.
Yet, if he has obtained a reputation for master ability in
diagnosis, in surgical technic, or in medical treatment, he
may continue to have a tremendous practice and to maintain
this practice against constant opposition.
In medicine, as in all other professions and trades, results
count. Fortunately, the men who are great in medicine are
also likely to be great in heart, great in mind and great in
spirit; but there are exceptions, and physicians know of
them probably oftener and better than do the public. After
all, the greatest prize that a physician can secure is the
esteem of his fellow craftsmen, not the easily procurable
flattery of the credulous public.
The public seems to believe there is no way of telling a
good physician, an ethical one, or a scientific one from an
unethical or an ignorant one. In many instances, public
judgment is based on the kind of car he drives, the church
he attends, the social position of his wife, his whiskers, or
the protuberance of his abdomen. Frequently, a 48-inch
waist measure is taken as the equivalent of a 48-caliber
brain. A man may be a good Elk, a first-rate Shriner, an ex
cellent sachem of the Red Men, own his own home, and be
considered a remarkable doctor, and still not be able to tell

whether a sinking pain in the pit of the abdomen is due to
an inflamed gall bladder or a gastric ulcer.
It is no longer possible to begin the study of medicine
with a high-school education or less, and, indeed, to study
even some of the technical procedures associated with medi
cine with such a minimum amount of education. Every repu
table medical college now requires at least two or more years
of work in an approved college of arts and sciences in addi
tion to four years of high school education before a man
can take up the basic medical subjects, such as anatomy,
physiology, pharmacology, or bacteriology.
With the increase in the medical curriculum, it now costs
at least $800 to $1,000 a year to educate a physician for a
period of eight years. Since the student loses such money as
he might have made during this period, the cost of his edu
cation approximates $20,000. If, at the age of 18, he were
to put $20,000 in the bank, he would have at the age of 50
almost enough income to live comfortably thereafter without
hard work.
Today there are so many different types of healers offer
ing their services to the public that it is well to have a list of
necessary qualifications in choosing a physician. Competence
is not the only necessary criterion. A patient might be
served with a doctor relatively less competent whom he could
trust implicitly than with one highly competent known as
an exploiter or even as a crook. In choosing a physician it
is well to find out first whether or not he is a graduate of a
reputable medical school, which requires at least four years
of thorough training; next, whether or not he served his
interneship in a reliable hospital; third, does he belong to
his county medical society or to the American Medical Asso
ciation; fourth, if he holds himself as a specialist does he
possess the certificate of one of the national examining
boards in the medical specialties. If he does not possess
this certificate, is he recommended by the general practi
tioners of the community as a competent specialist? As a
rule it is best not to select a specialist until one has seen a

general practitioner, who, following a good examination, can
tell whether a specialist is needed.
The doctor who advertises his methods in the newspapers
or who passes out handbills, the doctor who has a big adver
tising signboard, or a big electric sign in front of his office,
the man who guarantees a cure or who promises that he can
cure any serious disease in one or two treatments, the man
without a fixed residence who moves from city to city, and
the one who claims special knowledge that no other physi
cian has, is likely to be a charlatan and is not to be trusted.
The principles of ethics now official in the American
Medical Association are a gradual evolution of a series
worked over and developed through many years. It is signifi
cant that the work emphasizes, first of all, the duties of the
physician to his patient. These duties include service as an
ideal, patience, and delicacy as highly desirable qualifica
tions, and full assumption of responsibility once a case has
been undertaken. The principles of ethics emphasize that a
physician is free to choose whom he will serve, but point
out that he should respond to any request for assistance in
emergencies or whenever temperate public opinion expects
the service. Many a great merchant made his success on the
same factors.
The second chapter is concerned with the duties of physi
cians to each other. The physician is told that he must be
an honorable man and a gentleman, conform to a high stand
ard of morals, and uphold the dignity of his profession.
Then comes the question of advertising. The solicitation
of patients is unprofessional. The section dealing with this
question is explicit, covering every possibility and leaving
little doubt as to interpretation. But when all is said, the
conclusion is actually that a man ought to conform to the
customs of the community in which he lives. If it has been
the custom to publish a business card in the country news
paper, the physician may do so; on the other hand, if this
is not the custom, he may not do so.
The principles of ethics protect the individual physician
against the commercial group by stating that no group of

THE CHOICE OF A PHYSICIAN
physicians, organized as a corporation, may do any type of
advertising that is not permitted to the individual. The dif
ference in point of view here emphasized between medical
ethics and those of business is clearly apparent.
Medicine has for years depended for its success on the
personal relationship between physician and patient. The
great leaders know that the maintenance of this personal
relationship is essential. Hence, every phase of the principles
of ethics is planned to protect the rights of individual physi
cians with the commercial ideal primarily n mind.
It has been said that John Wanamaker and Marshall
Field owed their success to the idea that the customer is
always right. In other words, the purchaser must be pleased,
and he must be protected not only from the deceits of sales
manship but against his own folly. This, after all, is the type
of personal relationship which must exist between the physi
cian and his patient. A pleased patient, as the principles of
ethics repeatedly state, is the best type of medical advertise
ment. Just as the old law of caveat emptor no longer pre
vails in modern business, so also do the principles of medi
cal ethics proclaim, "It is unprofessional to promise radical
cures; to boast of cures and secret methods of treatment or
remedies; to exhibit certificates of skill or of success in the
treatment of disease; or to employ any methods to gain the
attention of the public for the purpose of obtaining
patients."
The ethical physician will not prescribe or dispense secret
medicines or other secret remedial agents. The analogy of
this part of the medical code to the best type of modern
business is perhaps the statement in the advertising of cloth
ing of the percentage of wool or cotton which make its con
tent. It is similar to the clear statement on fabricated silks
that they are not actually silks.
The principles of ethics were set forth not as a threat but
as an inspiration. Just as there are merchants who by their
nature rejoice in the shrewd deception of the ignorant cus
tomer, just as there are egoists in the control of manufac
turing industries who do not hesitate to place their personal

wishes above the good of all, so also there are in medicine
physicians who feel that their judgment in the matter of
prescribing remedies is better than that of the Council on
Pharmacy and Chemistry, appointed by the American Medi
cal Association to establish what is sound and reliable in
new remedies.
The fault is not in the principles of ethics; it is in the
character of the men who have failed to be inspired by the
ideals and the high principles of their leaders. One might
indeed quote Shakspere when Cassius is made to say, "The
fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars but in ourselves."
A patient lay seriously ill, his physician gave a sad prog
nosis and, after giving somewhat explicit directions as to his
conduct, asked, "Now is there anything else that I can get
for you?" "Yes," said the patient weakly, "another doctor."
From time to time, the official representatives of Ameri
can medicine have debated the question of consultation,
bearing in mind that the interest of the patient is para
mount.
Section one of this portion of the principles does not
equivocate. "In serious illness, especially in doubtful or dif
ficult conditions, the physician should request consulta
tions." And it continues, "In every consultation, the benefit
to be derived by the patient is of first importance. Time and
again physicians argue the question as to consultation with
irregular practitioners, or those devoted to the tenets of some
sectarian practice or cultist system." The principles of ethics
are not specific on this point, but there is a section devoted
to the honor of the profession, which says: "A physician
should not base his practice on an exclusive dogma or sec
tarian system, for 'sects' are implacable despots; to accept
their thralldom is to take away all liberty from one's action
and thought."
There are many physicians who refuse to recognize cultist
practice, even to the extent of giving aid to a patient while
the patient is still under the care or control of such a practi
tioner.

THE CHOICE OF A PHYSICIAN
There are others who do not hesitate to come in and give
advice to patients who may be under such care.
Above all, the physician must consider the good of the
patient.
There are physicians who are careful to inquire of the
patient as to whether or not he has seen a previous con
sultant and as to the opinions of the ones first consulted;
there are others who are not too meticulous in determining
this point. Indeed, a sagacious physician will know
promptly from the information possessed by the patient
whether or not he has been informed elsewhere concerning
his condition. One is almost prompted to suggest that in
these instances the wise physician will bear in mind the
motto "caveat vendor," just as the merchant must apply the
same motto to the type of customer who shops too insistently
and whose bills are likely to remain unpaid.
The principles of ethics recognize the fact that the medi
cal diagnosis is usually paid for insufficiently in comparison
with the reward of surgical technic. "The patient should be
made to realize," say the principles of ethics, "that a proper
fee should be paid the family physician for the service he
renders in determining the surgical or medical treatment
suited to the condition, and in advising concerning those
best qualified to render any special service that may be re
quired by the patient."
The third phase of the principles of ethics is again a
recognition of the duty of the physician to the public. He is
asked to remember that he is a citizen and to aid in enforc
ing laws and in giving advice concerning public health.
During an epidemic, he must continue his labors for the
alleviation of the suffering, without regard to the risk of
his own health or life or to financial return. He is asked to
warn the public against the devices practiced and the false
pretensions made by charlatans, and he is told finally that
these principles do not cover all of the obligations which
he may have, but are wholly a guide which will supplement
the ordinary conduct of a gentleman and the practice of
the Golden Rule. The last sentence reads, "Finally, these
