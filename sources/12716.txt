  		              		Experience Description   

  I had an accident where I fell off a ladder.  I went to the emergency room. The doctor gave me medicine that  caused a seizure. I was able to stand and use crutches to get from the front porch to my sister's car. I was coherent when I entered the emergency room. I told the nurse and attending doctor that I had Gilbert's Syndrome, which is a Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.   Prior to going to Radiology for an x-ray of my left leg, the doctor said that I had to have pain medicine administered prior to being  x-rayed. I told them not to give me anything, but  the  insisted and told the nurse to give me the shot. Within 30 minutes I was feeling nausea and light-headed. The x-rays were taken and I had ruptured  ligaments and tendons in the lower calf/ankle area. 

About 90 minutes after the injection I still could not stand, was light headed and nauseated. It two people to get me into the car. It took two people to get me out of the car and back to the family farm. My sisters were able to get me into a green plastic lawn chair. I had dry heaves, was drooling and with sweating dripping like a water fall from by head and body. My sisters moved me to a cushioned chair that they pulled from storage. I remember telling my sister that I didn't feel right.

 I felt like I was flying. I looked at my left hand, thumb and index finger.  My body was surrounded by an electrical blue force. As I tried to touch my two fingers, I felt them touch but they were one inch away from each other. I told my sister I didn't want to die and that I was floating away. 

I remember seeing the locust tree tops located along the north fence line. I took one last breath, exhale and I was gone. I went from seeing the tree tops to total Darkness! Everything was black, but I was floating. I could hear my sisters' voices, but the farther I floated away from them, the fainter their voices got. Then I went from total black darkness to a bright white light.  I was surrounded by clouds that seemed to be unfolding from the center of the light. I felt no pain. I felt an unending love and a sense of peace as I kept floating towards the light. At this point I couldn't hear my sisters. Then I heard a voice say, 'It's not your time!' Then I was pushed back into the totally black darkness. I could hear my sisters' voices getting louder and louder. Then WHAM! I was back in my body! 

One of my sisters had slapped my right cheek so hard she left a red mark on my face. I gasped for air as I saw her face. I saw the emergency medical technician's face, and the EMT said, 'We have him!' They said I was in full seizure mode for 20-30 seconds. I was gone for 10-15 seconds with no breathing and very faint pulse, if any. I was told that I went into full seizure again while being transported to the Medical Center.  My nephew said I was in full seizure, and arched back when they took me out of the ambulance. The convulsions and muscle spasms lasted 1 1/2 to 2 hours.   What I have trouble with, is dealing with the voice that said, 'It's not your time!' I don't yet understand the time issue.  What is 'time' in relation to the here and now when compared to the relation of 'time' in the white light? I was dead for 10-15 seconds, in full seizure for 20-30 seconds, but it seemed like a flash in time.  How did I go from seeing the blue energy haze around my left hand and two fingers, with everything in front of my eyes; all the trees, my sisters voices, sights and sounds to nothing? I went to total black darkness, void of any light. Then flash, I'm continually floating forward to the bright light surrounded by clouds without any indication of life in the clouds or life here on earth. I couldn't hear my sisters' voices any more.   

While gone, I had no pain from my fall off the ladder or any pain in my back, neck or my lower left leg. I had no pain. I wasn't sick anymore, I was floating. I don't know how to express this, but I was floating and moving forward. I was floating but it wasn't my physical damaged body, I left behind, which was a shell of who I am. There was something from inside me that was floating away, and heading towards the light.

The experience included:      Out of body experience  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  My sisters' voices were getting faint. I could hear my sister Jenni say, 'Don't leave me! Don't die on me! Stay with me Dick! Stay with me!' I could hear my sister Jeanne say that the EMT's were on their way. The EMT's were pulling into the lane from the road. She said, 'The EMT's are here, stay with me!'  I clearly left my body and existed outside it  

  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   It was like everything I was experiencing was more enhanced, cleaner, and clearer. It was not muddied by the matter or material of the living world.

After I passed from total Darkness into the bright white light surrounded by the white clouds. It seemed like the clouds were unfolding from the center of the bright light. The sensation of floating, no pain, at peace and I felt like I was being surrounded by an unending peace and love. It felt like when I was a little kid and my Grandma would give us hugs, or when we would fall asleep in her feather bed. Then the voice wasn't stern, but loving, peaceful. It said, 'It's not your time!'  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         Incredibly fast  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     I had no concept of time as we know it here in the physical world. I had no clue how long I was dead, or how long I was in full seizure.

  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      I went from hearing my sisters' voices, to faintly hearing their voices, to only hearing the one voice say, 'It's not your time!' Then after I was pushed back, my sisters' voices were faint and then loud again, once I was back in my body.

The experience included:       Passing into or through a tunnel  

  Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Uncertain.     I went from total Darkness to immediately seeing a bright light surrounded by white clouds that seemed to unfold from the center of the bright light. It didn't seem like a tunnel, but like I was floating in the clouds towards a bright light.

  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm.     It wasn't from here on earth, or from the physical, material world we live in. It was void of buildings, trees, birds, grass, and everything we associate with the physical world we live in.  

What emotions did you feel during the experience?         Loss that I was leaving my sisters behind. Loss of leaving my wife and two daughters behind. Loss of my life I as I know it.  The sensation of floating, of flying without wings. The feeling of total and complete love and peace, without any pain.   Being able to see crystal clear, everything that I saw without wearing glasses. The loving voice that said, 'It's not your time.'

    How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I feel like it happened yesterday and it happened back in August. My daughters have to remind me of their cross country track or ballet practices, yet I can remember the tree tops, the blackness and then the bright light with the white clouds as if they're right in front of me.    
    
Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I see my dead relatives more when I'm in a deep sleep. They come to me, to tell me things or warn of things to come. The things to come could be in relation to someone in the family, or future events in the world, that we have no control over.    

    Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Floating away from my body and away from my sisters.
