I served with 101st airborne division in Vietnam from April, 1969 to May, 1970.  May 21, we came against a well-fortified enemy. We attacked a hill next to a wall by a rice paddy.  Just before night, we were told to get our combat gear to charge the hill. I was pretty scared because I knew that maybe I’d get killed. As we attacked the hill, a mortar landed behind me and I flew thru the sky.  The first thing I did was pray for forgiveness, then all of sudden I could see myself laying the ground.  I had no more fear but only peace.  I wish I never came back but as I laid there all night, they came to pick me up.  Once someone touched me I came back to my body.
