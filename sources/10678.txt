SECOND SUBMISSION:  I had a problem in my marriage and decided that everyone would be better off if I was no longer around. I took an over dose of a drug that would put me to sleep forever. Being a ‘back sliding Christian’ at the time I believed that I would die and go to hell for a suicide, but I still got on my knees and prayed for forgiveness for what I had done. I was filled with the Holy Spirit then and I felt like I was forgiven by God. I began getting sleepy and I lay down on the bed still asking for forgiveness and telling God that I loved him.


Before I knew it, I was floating over the top of my bed looking down on my lifeless body. I could see myself and I knew I was dead. Suddenly I felt myself being pulled through this huge, vast area, there were no walls that I could see but I felt that I was being pulled through a tunnel with the light getting brighter and brighter. After a while, I was suddenly standing in front of this beautiful wrought iron Victorian gate, covered with the largest and most brilliant colored flowers I had ever seen.  Huge flowers 6 times larger than those we know on earth. The gate was partially opened amidst this huge cloud of nothing but brilliant white. The gate was to my right. I placed my hand on the gate to go through it. At that moment, I knew that it was the point of no return.


Just before I entered, a voice in my mind spoke to me. I turned to look to my left and there stood Jesus Christ. I could see his nail prints in his hands and feet.  But they were not in his hands; they were more in his wrist area and angles out as though they were torn from his weight. There was no verbal speaking, just mental telepathy. I ran to him and wrapped my arms around his feet, kissing his feet, and telling him how much I loved him, his arms came down and he held my head close to him as I cried hard.


He turned and looked upward toward his left, at that point, I stood and looked up to where he was looking (on my right) and I could tell that I was standing at the base of a huge stairway, (I called it a huge throne) with the most brilliant light shining down from it. It was God. Jesus was standing on the right hand of God at the base of his throne. I began talking to God telling him how much I loved him and Jesus. But God would not answer me. At that point, I could tell that Jesus was communicating with God through mental telepathy, telling God how much I loved him and believed that he died for my sins.


God then spoke mentally to me and told me how much he loved me. (Jesus was the mediator between God and me) God would not listen to me without Jesus first talking for me. God spoke mentally to me and told me to go back; your time has not yet come. I pleaded with him and fell to my knees, begging him not to send me back. No thought of the world was inside of me, it was all heavenly minded. I was crying and begging so loud that I suddenly felt Gods arms come down (There were no arms but I felt them) and he lifted me off my feet and cradled me as a mother cradles her baby against her breast. (He rocked me and held me in his arms) he gently placed me back to my feet and then told me that I had to go back because I children that were going to be born to me and I needed to go back and receive his gift of children. (The doctors told me I could not have children before I died).


The second that God told me he was giving me children, I immediately became earthly minded and began my trip back through this vast area until I was again hovering over my body in bed. I felt my feet enter through my fleshly head and lower itself into my lifeless body. When I opened my eyes, my husband was on his knees praying to God to NOT take me from him.

  				  Experience Description 826  				FIRST SUBMISSION:


My marriage was failing, I knew suicide was wrong but I took many pills, got on my knees and asked God for forgiveness. I started getting sleepy and went to my bed praying the whole time, asking God for forgiveness. Suddenly I was floating over my bed looking down on my body. I was near the ceiling. I knew I was dead. I could see myself in bed.


I began going through a vast area, traveling through a wide unknown area. I saw all white. I saw a beautiful gate that was half opened.  Then I walked to the gate.  Just as I was entering it, a voice (not a voice but mental telepathy) caused me to turn towards the voice.  I saw Jesus Christ and scars in his wrists. I ran to him and fell to his feet crying and kissing his feet, I kept telling him I loved him. He helped me stand up and I looked up at a huge throne where a bright light was coming from. I knew it was God. I began talking to him telling him how much I loved him but he would not listen to me.


Jesus looked up at him and began speaking to him for me. At that point, God listened. Now I know what the bible means by Christ is the mediator between God and man. God understood and told me to go back. I begged not to go. I felt such love and peace there. He told me this was not my time. He could not make me go back unless I wanted to. At that point, he told me that I had children that were going to be born to me. At that second, I desired to go back and he sent me back. Jesus stood on my left in front of Gods throne. That would have put Jesus on Gods right hand.  Amen. It is REAL...praise THE LORD!
