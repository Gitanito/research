  This was the short-lived reappearance of The Spiritual Age.  The journal contained considerable comment, pro and con, on T.L. Harris's new Herald of Light and its (supposed)  abandonment of spiritualism, and also articles on conditional immortality (whether souls are necessarily immortal) and interesting advertisements.  The journal never developed a vision of its purpose and ceased  after seven issues.  Harvard University microfilm.
