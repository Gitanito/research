  		              		Experience Description   

    This experience is something that has kept me up at night since I was 3 years old..
  
  I was in a strange looking tunnel that swooshed off to the right of me. The tunnel  did not meet its edges. There was a strange, thick white and black transparent mist moving through the tunnel. The tunnel itself was gray. As I moved through the tunnel, Beings were lined up to my right. Each Being looked the same. They were big black silhouettes with white eyes and white mouths. Almost all of these Beings had soft, closed eyes and smiles on their faces. I felt happy and warm when I looked at them. I walked through this tunnel for a very long time that felt like forever. The entire time, there were Beings  to my right and I had to look at their facial expressions to know how I did. Towards the end of the tunnel, I saw a few blank expressions and two or three angry expressions on the Beings. But, I did not fear the angry/blank expressions because I knew it was all good news. I came to a break in the cluster of Beings.  I felt so happy to finally meet someone who I was waiting to meet with. I crossed over the tunnel and onto a bright white, luminescent plateau. The sky was white, but it was a different shade of white than the plateau. It had a pale blue undertone to it. As I came up to the person I was waiting to meet, they were speaking with someone very important. The important person was dressed in a long, white gown with long, white hair. He  reminded me of  Santa. I knew this important person was VERY important, so I waited patiently until they were done with their conversation. The person I was waiting for had their backed turned to me so I could not see their expression.  The important person was facing me but I could not see their expression either because they were  hidden behind the person I was waiting for. When they finished speaking, the important person turned around and walked off to my left onto a road that looked like it was a marble road. 
  
  The person I was waiting to meet,  turned around and I was extremely ecstatic to finally get to see them.  I only had good news to show. However, when the person turned around, there were tears running down their face and they were extremely distressed. I came to them with open arms, ready to embrace them. When we embraced, I felt this excruciating pain through my whole Being. It hurt so much but I couldn't let go. I had to continue to hug them until they were ready to let go. When they finally did let go of me, I was a little shook and  had a hard time understanding what had happened. I went to walk along the marble road, but I only took a few steps. The person I had been waiting for grabbed me from behind, twirled me around to face them, and hugged me again. This time they were sobbing extremely loudly. The pain I felt from the second hug was far more excruciating than the first hug. The second hug lasted as along as I had moved through the tunnel. When they let go, the only thing I was thinking of was to run but I knew I was not allowed to move. I had to wait to see if they would do it a third time. There was so much fear in me that they would hug me a third time. I knew if there was a third hug, it was very bad news. We staired at each other for what felt like hours and I was waiting to see what was to come next. Eventually the person backed off, wiped their eyes and gave me beautiful smile as they shook their head. I knew in that moment, that I had to run to someone else. I ran on the marble road in the same direction the important man in the robe went.    					  


Background Information:       

Gender:   	Female  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 May of 1996  

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Uncertain  Accident  Childbirth     This happened two weeks before birth  Clinical death (cessation of breathing or heart function)   My heart stopped during a routine checkup two weeks before BIRTH. My mother having her first set of twins and having pneumonia throughout the pregnancy as well as 10 years diagnosed with MS was considered a high-risk patient. The nurse was trying to move me in the womb to make sure I was not born with a cleft palate, as my father had been born. My twin-sister had me smooshed up to the side with my face distorted. They used an electrical shock machine to zap me to move. Mother was not aware of what happened. The nurse zapped me, said nothing, and left the room in a slight panic. A doctor came in and gave liquid medicine, stating it was routine. After I was born, my mother was charged with medicine that could restart the heart. The chart note  posted two weeks before I was born  mentioned  having to restart my heart.  
  
How do you consider the content of your experience?        Both pleasant AND distressing  

Did you feel separated from your body?      No    I lost awareness of my body  

  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   I like to think I have a heightened level of consciousness but looking back on the experience, it doesn't make much sense. When I think of the me that went through this experience, I feel as if it was a normal thing to experience; I was not confused by what was happening and it made sense to me in the moment.  
  
At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         Steady level of consciousness/alertness throughout  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Time seemed to go faster or slower than usual.     Time really drug on but it wasn't something I could really measure consistently.  
  
Were your senses More vivid than usual?         More vivid than usual  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       The touch / physical feels of the experience were more vivid and memorable than any pain I have personally experienced in the past and I am a clumsy person.  
  
Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      There was no spoken words throughout this experience. At the one point to beings were 'speaking' but I heard no sound through the entirety of it.  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

  Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Yes     It was a grayish color. It had no exact point where its edges met. There was a strange white / black mist moving statically throughout the tunnel.  
  
Did you see any beings in your experience?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         No       

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         An unusually bright light  

  Did you see an unearthly light?         Uncertain   The place I came to was very bright but I wouldn't say it was unearthly bright. The light was more like the brightness of a migraine, but without the pain.  
  
  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm.     It was a little mystical. The place with the white sky / white landscape but it was familiar to me but with no earthly vibe to it.

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

  Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about myself or others.     I had an understanding of what was happening in the moment and it was very natural to me.

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Protestant   Raised Presbyterian I did not believe in predestination until 18 years old. Before the age of 18 I did not believe in Hell and believed everyone, no matter how corrupt, went to Heaven.  

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     I can't say it was a direct impact of this experience but I did come to find my baptized religion as true about the time I started contemplating this experience. Before the age of 18 I did not believe in Hell. While I still don't see myself as 100% Christian (as I have beliefs from all religions) I do now call myself Presbyterian if I have to label it.  

What is your religion now?         Christian- Protestant   I do now believe in Presbyterian beliefs but technically I am not a real Christian. I believe in Christ and I believe he is God's son but I have strong beliefs in reincarnation and some other religious beliefs such as Rastafarian (God is Physical, not a thing), Taoism, as well as some small Muslim beliefs (I believe Mohammed was a real man and I do believe some people don't go right to Heaven if that is where they're meant to be. Some do have to suffer in the grave before the release)  

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     I cant really say I had a belief system at the time. It took me 2 decades to connect this experience with the fact that I was clinically dead before birth.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         No       

  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   This important person, who was speaking with the one I came to meet, seemed of higher status consciously than anyone else through the experience, including myself. They were familiar to me, though.  
  
Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Uncertain     I like to think this very important person that reminded me of the 'Santa' was God. I felt safe about him and he seemed very familiar to me, like seeing a close relative I hadn't seen in a while.  
  
Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   I felt like I was being shown something important  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists     No       

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Uncertain     The person who I first came to was definitely someone  I loved. Aalthough I felt a sense of equal love for the silhouettes I walked past; the person who I met with was someone who I could easily say I put above myself.  
  
What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Unknown       

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Uncertain I've always taken my personal relationships with people meaningfully and as open as possible.  

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   A lot of what I said sounds confusing to me, even now. The feeling of this experience is like nothing else I have experienced in my life. As a young child, I was a pro at lucid dreaming (though I didn't know there was a term for this at the age) and the feeling of knowing was similar but the impact of the experience is like nothing I've ever come close to experiencing.  
  
How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I first memory was before 6 months of age and it does not at all feel like that first memory, most filled with confusion/curiosity. This was much more wholesome and rich feeling, while I did experience lows in it i felt it was necessary  

  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     As a young child I use to see spirits; it wasnt like 6th sense but they were a few a year I would see. Since the age of 13 I've only seen 5 or 6 since, mostly in the last few years but I also lived in an old, haunted house. I believe if I didn't live in that house I would have only experienced a couple.
  
Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          The meeting was definitely meaningful to me during the experience. It was something I longed for during the experience and it was special to me.  

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I first shared this experience with my mother when I was about 4 or 5 years old. She told me it was probably a dream and to not get too hung up on it, but as an avid lucid dreamer as a child I knew this was no dream as the impact was higher than any dream / nightmare I've ever had, same with the feeling looking back on it. I later shared this experience on a social media platform and that is when one of my followers had mentioned a possible NDE as i had stated on the site long before this post that I had clinically been pronounced dead. I was trying to be funny, cause did I really die if I was never born?
  
Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     As a child it felt very important to me; it was almost like a haunted feeling though. I was very confused by it.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     While I am still confused about what/ who some events were/meant I am definitely not as confused as I was when I was a child.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Uncertain   The connection I felt with the person I met with is very similar to the connection I felt/feel with my fiancé. I felt a physical pull to him when I met him 8 years ago and the love is unconditional as it was for the person during the meeting.
