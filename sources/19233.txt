one person asked me once how can you
prove that all of them aren&#39;t hostile I
still like him you can&#39;t prove a
negative it&#39;s axiomatic but I was asked
this at wright-patterson Air Force Base
let me tell you a little story that very
instructive
so we&#39;re there and there was a colonel
there who was in charge of this
operation at wright-patterson and Bruce
Ashcroft who was an intelligence officer
although he was posing as a public
information officer he&#39;s really Air
Force Intel a suit and so my military
advisor and I and another man who&#39;d
worked for the State Department and who
was also a naval Intel guy was with me
and so I went from the Rockefeller ranch
to wright-patterson Air Force Base to
this place where all this stuff from
Roswell was originally sent and we had
this meeting cuz it was forced on by the
head of j2 the the previous one I
briefed my people briefed Tom Wilson
Admiral Wilson and and when we got in
there we you know we basically said
we&#39;re not here to get information from
you because we know what you have here
we&#39;ve already penetrated what&#39;s here I&#39;m
we&#39;re here to provide information to you
so that you do not interfere with what
we&#39;re doing with the ce-5 contact
initiative so civilians are not called
in the crossfire between you guys and
what you&#39;re doing with ETS that was the
purpose of the meeting remember it&#39;s
very high stakes you know one thing I
don&#39;t want to do is have a group of
people caught in the crossfire so not
that the ETS would hit them but our
folks might accidentally and we almost
were hit at Mount Shasta a few years ago
yeah I&#39;ll tell you this story if you
want to hear about it during the
question-and-answer but during this
meeting the colonel finally at one point
said well how do you know that these
intelligences from elsewhere aren&#39;t a
threat to us I said well sir given the
galactically stupid
things we have been doing chasing them
firing at them developing laser particle
beam and other weapon systems and
knocking enough of them down that you&#39;ve
been able to reverse-engineer them if
they were hostile and they have
interstellar transportation technologies
it would have been point set match over
in 1945 about the time we developed the
atomic weapon the fact that you and I
are having this conversation and
breathing the free air of Earth is
abundant testimony to the fact that they
are non hostile even if they may not be
pleased with our stupidity don&#39;t get me
wrong I&#39;m not saying that these
civilizations are all together in thrall
with what&#39;s going on on this planet who
would be take a look around but if they
were overtly hostile it would could be
over in a nanosecond because let me
explain to you what the technologies are
if you know okay all of you looked at
video games and star war movies and Star
Trek and other rubbish
so okay wipe your mind clean of all the
rubbish that Hollywood puts out now
let&#39;s get into some real science for
just a minute if you&#39;re going from one
star system to another I mentioned this
earlier you have the ability to create
an electromagnetic field and go post
quantum what Einstein called a spooky
effect versus something that&#39;s the same
particle appears in two places at once
like that and it has to do with
nonlocality in physics the non-local
cosmos and other dimensions but the
power associated with that under
controlled circumstance is almost
infinite and if you were to take that
knowledge and weaponize it you could
take a planet target it turn it into a
pink mist floating through space
instantly it would not be a bunch of
little laser guns going like this like
you&#39;re playing you know I mean so if
these civilizations
have gotten here by definition their
interstellar and if their interstellar
their transdimensional and if their
transdimensional they have technologies
that would make our hydrogen bombs look
like a tinkertoy all right and yet here
we sit notwithstanding the fact that we
have been using electromagnetic weapon
systems to target them and knock them
down since 1947 the roswell crash was a
targeted electromagnetic switch that
knock to craft now they actually
collided with each other one went down
near Roswell one continued and impacted
near Socorro this isn&#39;t an FBI document
where talks about a new radar system
that&#39;s a euphemism that was turned on
and these two ET craft hit each other
went down I know men who have operated
the state-of-the-art ones that began to
be developed in the 50s and 60s and now
we&#39;re 6070 years into what are called
scalar or longitudinal electromagnetic
systems which are sort of
electromagnetic pulses that instead of a
having a wave like this our point
radiation so they&#39;re multiples of the
speed of light and the scalar technology
has been worked on for the better part
of a hundred years in some circles but
certainly intensely for 70 so we have
used those systems to track and target
ET craft since the 40s so if they were
in fact so hostile we would known about
it massively now it isn&#39;t to say that
they may have interests that run counter
to the dominant paradigm on earth but
what&#39;s the dominant paradigm on earth
war the dominant industry of the of the
world the number of one largest is we&#39;re
making and still is in 2015 when we
should have had world peace a hundred
years ago with the League of Nations so
this is a big question and so they may
be viewing us a bit jaundiced ly and
cautiously and as one British
intelligence officer told me
when we detonated the first atomic bomb
a big red flag went over this planet and
it was like kicking a hornet&#39;s nest they
became very concerned that we were
reaching very advanced technologies in
science that was instantly being
weaponized and being used against one
another and that meant that we became an
existential threat to ourselves and in
time we humans could be an existential
threat to other worlds so that&#39;s part of
the concern and it&#39;s justified concern
because humans don&#39;t have a great track
record now this is only because the good
people of the world I mean most people
on the planet are not wanting to blow
the planet up just I lived in the Middle
East for three years most people Arab
Israeli Christian Jewish Muslim they
just wanted to educate their kids and I
mean you know it&#39;s a if you get 10% of
sociopaths who want to create trouble
your society is a wreck and that&#39;s what
we&#39;re dealing with the good people have
allowed the 10% or 5% of sociopaths and
Psychopaths to run amok which is what
happened with Hitler in Germany so the
good people have to find their courage
and that&#39;s our job your job my job so I
view this as something all of us have to
do it isn&#39;t don&#39;t look to the President
of the United States as John Podesta
said and by the way a little footnote on
that you know people think his interest
in this was recent it wasn&#39;t after we
did the National Press Club event 2001
he publicly came out in favor of
disclosure this is the senior advisor to
the President Obama and also he was
chief of staff for a number of years
four or five years for Bill Clinton
during which time we were doing all this
with the the you know this project
starlight which has been miss named the
Rockefeller initiative who was it in the
Rockefellers initiative it was project
starlites initiative frankly so but
Podesta was always aware that in a sense
what Truman and then Clinton said about
the White House
is that it&#39;s the crown jewel in the
federal penitentiary system that once
someone is in that system they&#39;re so in
a box and when he left the Obama
administration recently he tweeted out
which became of this big uproar about
how one of his regrets was not being
able to effect UFO disclosure now some
people thought it was a bit of a joke
but it wasn&#39;t because there&#39;s a press
conference in 2002 after we did our 2001
that National Press Club event where he
talks about disclosure or needing to in
secrecy and release the UFO files and
information but his interest goes back
to the Clinton era before because he was
chief of staff for Clinton when we were
doing all this work prior to what the
public knows is the disclosure project
does that make sense so he was also the
POC at the point of contact for Obama
and for the briefing that&#39;s here that I
provided after Obama was elected and he
assembled the Obama cabinet did not
immediately take a role in the Obama
White House but he put the cabinet
together he was the head of the
transition committee between the
election and and January 20th when Obama
was inaugurated in January 20th of 2009
and there was a man who was doing a
course with him at Georgetown Law School
who&#39;s an attorney here in town who wants
to be anonymous who said look you know
he&#39;s very interested in this and you
know the president of course is going to
be in the same situation they all are
and so I was asked to put together a
briefing and it went to this man for
Podesta and Obama because Obama was you
know looking to John Podesta sort of his
secrecy guru because he had been a
senator from Illinois or someplace for a
couple years he didn&#39;t know anything
about all this and he wasn&#39;t gonna be
told by his CIA director Leon Panetta
cuz I sent this same thing to lean on
Panetta because he didn&#39;t know anything
being CI director so that&#39;s kind of my
role is to be the bridge between this
unacknowledged world and that world when
I&#39;m asked to do it and it continues
so last year I was about a year and a
half ago I was in Australia on an island
with 120 world leaders
I was asked the year before that it was
the Director of National Intelligence
who had just retired who briefed them
and two years before his bill and
Hillary Clinton that year it was my turn
in 2013 and and I presented all this
material to all these people in the
world so I&#39;d continue to do this and
then my wife and I will send out
packages of disclosure stuff to Colonels
and people in Switzerland and people at
Davos and you know it&#39;s this whole
networking thing by the way that&#39;s where
your tuition is going because these
things are very expensive to do and we
have no funding and no staff Emily and I
just with some volunteers do all this
now one of the things that you have to
understand about these leaders in the
world is that most of them are just agog
when they hear about it they go oh well
I was I&#39;m Minister defence of Australia
or whatever and I&#39;ve never heard of any
of this going on at Pine Gap and they&#39;re
not lying I said well no you wouldn&#39;t
so it&#39;s sort of a in the it&#39;s an
enviable thing to have to do because I&#39;m
really to deliver a very bad news to
have to show up to someone that powerful
and say by the way here&#39;s what you don&#39;t
know that you&#39;re being lied to about but
so we continue to do that but the big
action and that&#39;s sort of a service to
people in government because I view the
good people and there are good people in
government as victims of this secrecy
just like we are where they failed is in
their constitutional duty to take on
that machine
and that&#39;s where the courage comes in
and I think that&#39;s why we&#39;re going to
have to view ourselves as the leadership
all of us in this room and the people
out in the public who support disclosure
and the next wave of disclosure are
going to be two things we&#39;re going to
talk about effort or break in a moment
one is a mass defection program what am
I talking about
we&#39;ve got a network tell everyone we
know and find another wave of people who
are currently deeply involved in these
covert
programs who will approach me and we
will massively defect at once because
even what I&#39;m sitting on there&#39;s
probably 10 or 15% that&#39;s out in the
public domain some people I&#39;ve
interviewed have asked me not to release
it till they&#39;re dead
okay so that&#39;s the next phase the other
is mass contact we have got to create
teams all over the world that are
skilled in the art of the ce-5 closing
hours of 15 protocols who go out on a
regular basis and create in
consciousness but also in action the
ability for mass contact to happen this
peaceful before this false flag creates
the overlay so it&#39;s a race where race
against the clock and so that&#39;s how it
has to happen and that&#39;s something that
you don&#39;t have to sit on your hands
waiting for the President to do or for
that matter me to do that&#39;s something
all of us can do yeah
and people who have done the cg5
initiative even using the app we get
reports every day on our website of
amazing contact and things that they&#39;ve
had so if more and more people start
doing that the ETS are going to get the
message that not everyone on planet
Earth is sleepwalking see they need to
see that now people have asked me Larry
King asked me why don&#39;t they just land
on the White House lawn order Superbowl
game
I say yeah they could do that but all
that would do would trigger mass panic
because these folks in the intelligence
community would say oh we&#39;re being
invaded we need to fight them they know
not to hit that tripwire they want us to
invite them and create the correct
atmosphere of universal peace in
consciousness and action to make contact
then there will come we build it they&#39;ll
come they&#39;re here anyway even when
they&#39;re invisible because most of the
time they&#39;re shifted beyond the speed of
light and you can&#39;t see them anyway
there&#39;s what I&#39;m going to talk about in
LA at the big at this workshop I&#39;m doing
and Glendale but I think that&#39;s why if
we understand how powerful we each are
not only to find more and more mass
defecting witnesses inside booze
Allen Hamilton then inside the CIA and
Lockheed Martin and skunk works and
Dugway proving grounds and Nellis Air
Force Base and Pine Gap and I have a
whole list of corporations and
facilities that I&#39;ve updated of where
these operations are currently going on
and we need to have people in those
systems come out not trickle out one at
a time with no credibility but on Moss
just like the o1 event but on a larger
and deeper level so that&#39;s what I&#39;m
calling for now and then the other is
all of us becoming ambassadors to the
universe as citizen ambassadors peaceful
contact and that&#39;s something every
single person can do in their own
community and if you do it and you
practice it and learn what the protocols
are you&#39;ll be quite stunned at what will
happen it&#39;s beautiful
