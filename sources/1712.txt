denved from tt, but that 1t would ·be anexcess of pRtiahty to suppose
it applicable to disease ~nerally. . . . :
But amid all the opimons set up.agaill!t the experience of Hahne-
mann, his person, at le~st, ought t~ ha.ve been spared. He who had
himself never assumed an offensive attitude, and the truth of whose
doctrine& only could with propriety be combated, o11ght to have been
treated with due respect, whi~h.I regret to say, he did not ~ceiv~ at
the hands of some of the phystCians of Germany. For previOusly to
his appearance as the reformer of medicine, he had been known and
esteemed as one of the most learned, accomplished and meritorious
physicians in Germany. Distinguished for his acquisition in philo-
logical learning, possessing a comprehensive acquaintance w~th the
natural sciences, ~nd particularly with chemistry, his reading through
the whole range of medical literature was extensive, and in every re~
spect he had acquired a thorou~h medical education. ~ · ·
After he had laid. the. foundahon ~f his education at one of the most
considerable schools of clas~icalliterature, Afra, near Meissen, which
afterwards led him io a familiarity with the writings of the Greek and
Roman physicians, and .bad studied at several of the German univer.
sities, he went to T:ransylvania in the capacity of p"hysician and libra-
rian to a nobleman. Here he.had an opportunity of cultivating an
acquaintance witb the works of the Arabian phystcians, and the me-
dical literature of the middle ~ges. During h1s residence as prac-
tising physician, subsequently at Dresden and Leipzig, he availed
himself of the extensive libraries at those places, and his endeavours
were incessant there to add to the stores of his knowledge in every
J>&rtieular~ Nor were his extraordinary talents, which in riper.years

rendered him one of the greatest medical geniuses, unknown at that
time. He contributed not a little, even at that early period, to the im-
provement ofmedicine; among other things he directed his attention to
the subject of poisons, which were then treated in a very unsafe and
precarious manner, and his book on the Poison of Arsenic, was at
that time of great and acknowledged value. The Hahnemannean
test for wines, spread his reputation extensively, and first placed a
limitation to the nefarious practice of adulterating these liquors with
lead. The discovery of the well known mercurial preparation Mercu-
rius Solubilis Hahnemanni, as well as his instructions concerning a
more simple and effectual mode of treating syphilitic diseases, secured
to his name an honourable place among practitioners of medicine,
and his translations from the English, French and Italian writers,
were of·considel'llble utility. In one of his large works he has pro-
vided for the more scientific instruction of the apothecary, and pro-
duced a very beneficial influence in this, hitherto, so indispensable a
calling to medicine. This work brought him into great repute with
the apothecaries of Germany, who at that time as little imagined as
Hahnemann himself, that in so short a time he was about to render
their entire profession superfluous. All his writings, including the
many notes appended to his translations, denote the learned and tho-
roughly accompHshed physician, the strict and conscientious man, the
earnest enquirer after truth, and the profound observer.
But the more deeply Hahnemann penetrated into the study of me-
dical science, and in proportion as his experience became enlarged at
the bed side of the patient, so much the more manifest to him was the
abundant penury of the healing art, and particularly the great uncer-
tainty of its fundamental principles. The nature of diseases was in-
volved in obscurity, notwithstanding the continual researches of nu-
merous enquirers; indeed, the more learned the physicians, the more
divided frequently were they in opinion respecting the proper cause
and nature of a disease, and yet aga·inst the cause and nature their
treatment must always be directed. ·
The result of medical treatment was in but too manv cases unfa-
vourable, very often wholly uncertain, nay, sometimes apparently de-
pending upon mere casualty; in diseases too, which had already been
mvestigated and described by innumerable observers-diseases whose
original causes were known, the entire nature, the proper essence of
wh1ch, it was presumed, were intimately understood. The numerous 1
cases offailure in the cure must have convinced every impartial and
candid physician of the melancholy truth, that injurious effects often
arose from medical interference, that many diseases instead of being
alleviated, were thereby, only the more exasperated-and that actual
cures but too rarely occured. Nor could it escape the notice ofevery
taithful observer, that not unfrequently after the removal of one dis-
ease, another soon occupied its place, which if not worse than the
former, was to a similar degree injurious. Such was the condition of
medicine at that time, and notwithstanding the many apparent im-
provements it has acquired, such remains the condition of the prevail-
mg art ofmedicine at the present day. These, by the way, are not
the views ofone discontented observer alone. The voices of physi-
eians of acknowledged eminence,have at different ti11:1es been loud on
Digitized by Coogle
the occasion, from thegreat observer Sydenham, to the energetic Cru-
eger Hannsen,• the Ulrick de Hutten ofour days, declare to us but
too well, that the greatest uncert11inty reigns over the noble art
wherein the greatest certainty is desirable, that it does not, jn fact, ac-
complish what, after so many worthy endeavours for its advancement
might have been reasonably expected from it. Especially uncertain
was the knowledge of remedies. Herein implicit reliance was placet!
upon traditions, partly derived from antiquity, and partly from the
common people. By means of numerous hypothesis endeavours were
made, it is true, to give to those crude and empiricaltnaterials some-
thing like a 'scientific shape, but it was at all times liable to changes
adapted to the views of succeeding speculators. It was almost an
invariable rule to unite several remedies together into one mass, the
' combination being supposed, on hypothetical grounds, to be the pre-
feyable mode of exhibition, and as long as this process was observed
in their prep&ration, no ge1mine experience could be acquired con-
cerning the effect of individual or isolated remedies. To the quiet •
empiric, who would only cure acr.ording to modes recommended by
experience, nothing at length remained but cathartics, emetics, su-
dorifics, rubefacients, opium, mercury-tJar excellenc;e, a kind of uni-
versal remedy-and finally venaesectton,- that powerful meaas to
weaken disease by weakening the strength ofthe patient. The sudden
silencing of symptoms after blood letting, calomel or opium was con-
sidered a cure, because the apt employment ofthese remedies was then
thebestresourceknown to the physician, and without them he could
effect nothing. When, however the symptoms were not to be silenced
or removed by these remedies, when no specific remedies were known,
or had failed of procuring relief, viz. in the most violent diseases-the
resources of the most able physician were at an end. In Enp;land
more particulacly, the example ofSydenham was pursued, in relying
upon mdividual and collective expertence, and in the avoidance ofdis•
cussion; but in Germany theories concerning the nature of diseases
and of remedies were more the objects of attention, and, as respects
the latter particularly, the most contradictory opinions were enter-
tained. While, for instance, a remedy was extolled by one beyond
measure, another entirely rejected it; while one appealed to a series
ofcures in proofof ita virtues, another would tell you that in his hands
it had utterly failed. In many cases of disease, which, by no means
could be pronounced absolutely incurable, every imaginable remedy
only aggravated the complaint ; in others the physician was sometimes
surprized with a cure as unexpected as it was inexplicable. Amid
the uncertainty of these discussions nothing could be decided by an
appeal to such authorities; opinions concerning the nature and essence
of medicines were then, and still remain to be, mere matter of opi-
nion, ever various and ever discrepant; nor were clinical experiments
more decisive, for diseases as well as the constitution of the patient
are subject to manifold diversities.
The more Hahnemann regarded these facts, and when he saw how
precarious were the.principlesofthe healing art, themore was he driven
to deep and serious reflection. He observed that medicine had deviated
from the true path since the time of Galen, that physicians had not like

Hippocrates, nor like ourselves, in modem times, with respect to all
other natural sciences, made pure experiment the basisof all their con-
clusions. Bacon, the first awakener of Europe, had indeed, established
this method for the acquisition ofall positive science, and had restrain-
ed metaphysical speculation within its properlimits. Sydenham like-
wise, by his own great example had taught, that experience should
be placed above theory in medicine, yet the great truth had not been
hitherto justly regarded. Much indeed \vas said of experience, but
such experience was for the most part impure; experiments were
made with a view to establish preconceived opinions, or were con-
stantly blended with hypothesis, the former were made to bend to
the latter, and the one was never rigidly separated from the other.
Even from that country which gave birth to a Bacon, a Sydenham
and a Jenner, at a subsequent period, flowed like a stream of desolat-
ing lava the murderous system of Brown-parallelled only in mo-
dern times by its two children, the choleric contrastimulus of Italy,
and the inflated and enthusiastic, yet somewhat blood-thirsty system
of Broussais. The Germans excelling all other nations in extensive,
profound and various· erudition, surpass likewise in the love of con-
structing syste~s, and in scientific fancies. A luxuriant and flowing
tree, the natural philosophy of Schelling, shot forth, and upon this
stock shortlyafter, newsystems ofmedicine wereengrafted,which were
commanding, fair and seductive, in their promise of dazzling results;
but at the bed side of the patient their results were found nugatory.
The scientific zeal ofthe Germans became intensely enkindled by that
spirit of research which penetrated into every department of science,
and their endeavours 1!o extend the bounds of human knowledge were
excited anew ; but at the bed side of the patient their fine ideas were
unavailing. These researches led to important discoveries in all the
natural sciences, but medicine, the most useful of all, received thereby
no valuable acquisition. But previously to these events Hahnemann
had already begun to ply his strength in an opposite direction. In
the same country, where the towering edifice of hypothetical medi-
cine was about to attain its loftiest and most giddy height, there
arose at the same time in direct antithesis, the pure experimental
science of Hahnemann.* Convinced that enquiries after the reason
of Phenomena were fruitless, and therefore inadmissible, Hahnemann
sought to scan the laws of these phenomena. Antecedent experience
did not suffice him, he desired to receive it more pure and authentic.
For him, the descriptions of the symptoms of diseases hitherto made,
were too deficient ;-he required them to be described more carefully
and precisely, free from all hypothesis, and according strictly with tho
phenomena presented. He therefore began to administer medicines
m their simple form, he collected his experience of their effects and
described the diseases in which they had been salutary. But though
all this was very meritorious, his observations after all, were but
isolated and individual. Although he assimilated with those ~reat
practitioners Svdenham and Hoffman, Boerhaave and Gaubius, Stoll,
Quario, Culleri and De Haen, whatever valuableexperience these bad

blade in l~lated cases, the darkness which rested over medicine as a
whole, nevertheless, remained still the same. Hahnemann went so far
after eight years practice, as to be upon the point of abandoning it
wholly. He would not, he said, treat diseases, the nature ofwhich was
yet unfathomable, and ~herefore could afford no certain indication in
their treatment, whose causes could but seldom be discovered, and
which still more rarely pointed out their appropriate remedies. He
became too con11cientious to administer to the patient a remedy which
he could not in advance know to be strictly adapted to the ease. In
a given disease what was it which ga•e the certain information-that
out of the numerous remedies recommended, this or that is the one
indicated1
But, said Hahnemann, I had several children, and 'when from times
to time they were visited by serious sickness, I was forced to witness
their sufferings without possessing the ability, with certainty,ofadmin-
istering to ttieir relief. As it had been a matter of conscieo~e with
him to relinquish the practice of medicine, because of its uncertain·
ty-was it a duty .less imperative, that he should strive to attain to
certainty 1and as he felt the insufficiency of the healing art the most
painfully at the sick bed of his children, he could not t:esist the belief
that there must be solid principles of universal validity~ but that they
were only not yet discovered-that order must be brought out of the
confusion hitherto abounding if we but faithfully examine and unres-
trainedly observe nature, and interrogate her Without the intrusion of
our own hypothesis, and without moulding the result according to
our own preconceived opinions.
At this time a ray of light penetrated his mind, and the dawn of
a new day of Medicine broke forth. It was in the year 1790, whilst
hQ was engaged in the translation of Cullen's Materia Medica, at the
article cinchona. Hahnemann was thirty-five years ofage when these
new views first attracted his attention.
-·......
Peruvian bark had already for a long time been recognised as a spe-
cific remedy in Intermittent Fevers, and a discussion long existed
among physicians why and how it properly affected the cure, a sub-
ject, however, upon which they were by no means unanimous. Hahne-
mann's enquiries were mainly directed to ascertain, in what species of
intermittent fever it was peculiarly salutary; for he had clearly per-
ceived that while it had been effectual in somecases, in others it com-
pletely fai!ed; nay, not unfrequently, in spiteofevery precaution, it had
been more prejudicial to the patient than the fever itself. While he en-
deavoured to ascertain precisely in what species of fever, and in what
determinate forms of it the remedy was actually salutary, he closely
observed all the cases which it had cured, and, indeed, more closely
and circumstantially than he had hitherto been accustomed to think
neeessary, During the translation of Cullen's Materia Medica, before
alluded to, he was reminded that the bark on being administered to per-
sons in health, or those untouched by fever, sometimes produced a fe-
brile condition ofan intermittent character. But the symptoms ofthis
~nditioo were similar, in a remarkable degree, to the gymptomsofthat
fever in the cure of which bark was effectual-before all other reme-
dieS. These, then, were Hahnemann's reflections: How I then the
bark actually possesses the property ofproducing an intermittent fe-
brile condition, andfor that very reason to cure, and preferably indeed,
lUCk intermittentfevers as aresimilar to those which it can ofitselfpro-
duce.
Upon this subject experience alone could decide, and for its eluci-
dation a series of experiments were instituted; when behold I experi-
ments both on himselfand onother healthy persons taught Hahnemann
incontestably, that .barkeffected peculiar changes in die animal econo-
my ofman in health; and when he collected, f,·om the cases ofdifferent
pef!!Ons, all the symptoms which he had cured with this remedy, -he
perceived further, that in all the cases wherein the patients had been
really cured with the bark, such patient had had symptoms highlysimi-
lar to those artificially produced by the same agent. In this manner
did he determine, the fir11t, among the thousands ofphysicians who had
given the bark as a specific against every intermittent fever, amon~ the
thousands who had prescribed it, sometimes to the injury, someturies
to the benefit ofthe patient-the only one who determmed closely and
definitely the cases in which bark was really salutary. To quote for
example, some ofthe principal of them. In cases adapted for the use
of bark, it is requisite that the _
attack should be ushered in with some
accessary symptoms, so that before the commencement of the chill,
palpitations of the heart, great anxiety or nausea, great thirst, canine
appetite, or pressin~ head-ache takes place ; that there be no thirst.
etther during the chtll or the heat, or at most between the two, or du-
rin,r the sweating stage; that there be considerable determination of
blood to the head during the fever, with distension of the superficial
veins ; or heat of the face in the chill with coldness of other parts ;
that the bowels be loose, the sleep by night restless, interrupted by
anxious and frightful dreams, with stupidity or longcontinued anxiety
after waking, and the like. But those cases particularly are adapted
wherein all the morbid symptJQms which occur during the apyrexia,
eloselr correspond with those produced by bark. This example may
serve tn some measure, at thesame time,toshow the closeness and accu-
racy, with which Hahnemann noted the symptoms in every case of
fever.
After making these experiments with bark, Hahnemann prosecuted
still further his enquiries into the same law of cure, whether it would
be confirmed also with respect to other remedies. The next subject
which offered itselffor consideration, was the effect of mercury. The
specific virtue of this remedy against syphilis had already long been
known. It was clear that the mercurial disease, that it is to say, that
change of the organization which is produced by mercury, in many of
its symptoms manifested great similarity with syphilis. Sulphur, too,
the well known specific against the Itch, every one knows, is capable
of producing an eruption similar to that of the itch. Just as striking-
ly was the same law corroborated in the case of narcotic plants.
These had long been recognised as the principal remedies in mental
diseases, and it-is incontestably shown in the histories of poison51, that
they produce of themselves mental alienation. Another confirmation
is extant in the vaccine. lt is evident to every one, at first glance,
Digitized by Coogle
9
that this is a. disease remarkably similar to the small pox, and that
by it, the susceptibility to the latter is destroyed.
Hahnemann also found narratives in the writings of physicians of
both ancient and modern date, of very many cases of one disease or
the other being cured in a remarkable manner, with this or the other
remedy, while other narrators again, ignorant of these accounts, relat-
ed what the same remedies had incidentally produced,and these inci-
dental symptoms were strikingly similar to those diseases which hadbeen
cured bv the remedies.
A collection of such. quotations has been made and communicated
by Hahnemann in his work. Other facts tending to confirm the same
law are also cited by him, such as the well known cure of frost-
bitten limbs by means of snow, that the most appropriate cures for
burns are not coolin~ but heating remedies, such as the application
of cotton,spiritsofwme, and oil of turpentine;the latter of which, since
Hahnemann's observation, has been noticed by Abernethy, and by
Larry, as an effectual remedy after the use of moxa. We recollect
also, that the cure of certain cases of acidity of the stomach, we are
told by an American physician, may be the best effected not with
magnesia, but lemon juice. Other cures of a similar character might
be mentioned, such for example, as the cure of the sweating fever by
means of sudorifics; diarrhrea, bv means of laxative remedies and the
like-to be found in ihe writingS of impartial observers; cures which
though they may, indeed, be explained in another manner, are cer-
tainly very striking and remarkable by their great number and im-
portant bearing.
But,how much soever the precedingexamples may declare in corro-
boration of the Homreopathic law, they do not prove that that Jaw is
the chief one, and to be laid down as the principle of the healing
art. It still renJained questionable whether the newly discovered law
had universal validity, and was applicable in all cases. Hahnemunn
found during his researches, that several physicians had already con-
jectured and even openly asserted that it was. None however,had veri-
fied it in a manner by which alone it could be verified, that is, by a
series of experiments. In some of the writings ascribed to Hippo-
crates, a passage occurs, which says: " medicines cure diseases simi-
lar to what they produce." Paracelsus, also, who had rent asunder the
chains imposed by Aristotle and Galen, more than once observes, that
" it is a perverted method taught by Galen, to give remedies which
produce the contrary of the disease, remedies ought to be adminis-
tered which act similarly to it." Hieronymus Cardanus and Thomas:
Erastus, at the same time expressed their approval ofthis law ofcure.
About the middle of the last century, a Danish physician very expli-
citly pronounces that the supreme Iaw ofcure is not contraria contra-
riis, but similia similibus. Yet, notwithstanding which, there ne-
ver had been a physician who in earnest, made any use of this law,
much less pursued farther these important speculations.
The same was the case in the discovery of America.......Among the
ancient Greeks evident traces are extant of their knowledge ofa coun-
try in the west; the northern navigators had traditions ofvessels hav-
ing reallr sailed there, and Ion~ before Columbus made the discovery
of America, Martin Behaim, of Neuremberg, constructed a terrestrial
B
o;g,tjzed by Coogle
globe, upon one side of which he delineated this division of the earth,
and upon the other a large country, its antipodes. Yet none had actu-
ally visited the western continent, and so doubtful was its existence,
that Columbus was obliged to undergo ten years ofanxious endeavour,
·before he received the little vessels for his expedition. Thus also was
Hahnemann the first who prosecuted those speculations, the first
who explored the great path, and bestowed upon that law of cure
more than ten years of painstaking investigation.
-·-
Experience however, alone could decide concerning it-pure, cer-
tain and enlarged experience. And in·order to realize this experience,
much more knowledge was to be acquired of remedies than hitherto, viz.,
what they were capable ofeffecting upon man in a state of health,and
what morbid phenomena they were able to excite. Here Hahnemaon
had a field of infinite extent before him, which could only be cultivated
through the most patient and laborious investigations. Every step cost
great sacrifices,and years wererequisiteto makeeven a small beginning.
Before him, nothing at all had been attempted in this way. The
German physician Stoerk, had, it is true, contrived similar experi-
ments with some· draAtic p,lants, but his observations were too gene-
ral, and he described what he had observed of their effects in expres-
sions not sufficiently definite. The experiments of W. Alexander, of
Scotland, valuable as they might otherwise be, were liable to the same
objections. ·
The great Haller had once declared, that to be able to judge of the
effects of different plants, experiments ought to be made with them
upon persons in health-the result of which might then be assumed as
the foundation of something stable and certain for directing their em-
ployment in disease. But none had yet carried this pre~ept into prac-
tice. The enunciation -was suppressed, and the glorious type was
forgotten. .
Hahnemann was the first who actually undertook these important
investigations, and conducted them too with great precision, under the
conviction that morecertainty must thereby be communicated to me-
dicine. Desirous of the co-operation ofother physicians, in the prose-
cution of his enquiries, nay if possible the general co-operation, in
1796, he wrote his treatise: " Concerning a new principle for discover-
ing the curative virtues of medicine," and in a tone entirely peacea-
ble. announced therein the views which he had formed during six years
of patient investigation. Sneering animadversions were the only re-
ply he received, but in general little attention was paid to it.-
Hahoemann was obliged, therefore, to tread the path alone. With
praiseworthy zeal and perseverance, he collected from the writings
of physicians, both ancient and modern, whatever served to assist him,
and whatever they had promulgated respecting the positive effects of
remedies. But here his investigations were necessarily, and almost
exclusively confined to the narratives of cases of accidental poisoning
by medicinal substances. For, whenever a physician described the
effects of any medicine, he had commonly not administered it alone,
but in combination with others, and such experiments were therefore

disturbed, impure and inconclusive, affording but little assistance to
Hahnemann in his exceedingly pure and simple.observations. He was
obliged, therefore, to institute a new set of experiments, with medi-
cines generally, upon persons in health, but he ha.d very few to aid him
in these investigations. Indefatigably, however, did he prosecute
them, and with admirable assiduity was this arduous path pursued by
him for fifteen years, when he published to the world as the first
fruits of his great labour, his Fragmenta de viribus Medicamentorum
positivis. This work was answered either by indifference or down-
right ridicule. In short, it happened to him in Germany as it did to
the inventor of the Steam-boat, in North America, when he first sub-
mitted his boat to the ordeal of an experiment. But Hahnemann
was as little confounded as was Fulton. For it is indicative of great
minds undauntedly to prosecute a noble design, in defiance of the
whole world; the great idea becomes, as it were, an element of their
souls. And history teaches us, that though men ofexalted views have
sometimes failed,in the prosecution of magnificent undertakings, yet
the greatest spirits always ac;hieve the VIctory, and bear away the
palm. Hahnemann who now stands forth as conqueror, at the time
to which we allude, was obliged to witness his well·merited literary
fame suffer a temporary eclipse, by reason of his new discoveries, and
painstaking investigations; nay, in consequence of his unremitted ap-
plication to.scientific pursuits, to feel his station in society exceedingly
embarrassed. But more convinced from day to day of the beneficial
tendency of his enquiries, nothing deterred him from the prosecution
of them, even at the greatest temporal hazards.
-·-
One of the first observations which Hahnemann made during these
new investigations was, that children who had been poisoned by the
berries of Belladonna, (an accidentoffrequent occurrence in Germa-
ny,) were sometimes attacked by an eruption of the skin, resembling
that of scarlet fever; and that the same Belladonna, when given as a
remedy in scarlet fever, cured the disease, and likewise afforded pro-
tection to healthy children against its attacks :· Hahneman lost no
time in laying these facts before the public, in order that physicians
might be enabled speedily to quell the ravages of the scarlet epidemic,
whiCh was at that time prevalent in Germany. But his instructions
were either badly followed and misconstrued, or rejected with derision
and contempt. Subsequently, however, not a few medical men of
high reputation in Germany, established the curative virtues of Bella- ·
donna, in genuine scarlet fever, yet thev denied that the medicine
could of itself produce any thing similar; but others have, on the con-
trary, observed that it was capable of producing an artificial scarlet
fever, as has been noticed by several German physicians, as well as
by Jolly, in France,• but denied to it the property ofcuring the genu-
ine disease. Yet all these testimonies in its favour, did not bring the
medicine into general repute.
To Hahnemann. who meanwhile pursued theeven tenor of his way,
this remedy afforded _an opportumty for one of the greatest and

most wonderful discoveries which the mind of man has ever made :
namely, that of Developin!( the medicinal virtue of MedicitJes, (Poten-
ziru7l~ der Heilmittel.) This is the same, which, under the name of
Dilutions-and of the Millionth arid Billionth of a dose, has become
so exceedingly obnoxious, and will be likely to remain so, as long as
men obstinately doubt, rather than resort to experiment to investi-
gate the matter, and because it is the easiest of all things to laugh at
and hold it op to derision-to call it necromancy, mysticism, absur-
dity, charlatanerie and imagination, is far easier than to make experi-
ments.
Hahnemann supposing that Belladonna, because it. had the proper-
ty of producing an eruption similar to that of scarlet fever, would
also cure this disease, resolved to make trials with the remedv. He
Bave it in very minute doses, according to the prevailing views, viz.:
m the f, T·~· ·i~ of a grain of the extract, or a single drop ofthe juice.
The result was salutary in many cases, but not unfrequently instead
of the cure, he observed an aggravation of all the symptoms of the
complaint. This was what might naturally be expected. The reme-
dy, which in the healthy subject was capable of producing something
.Umilar to this disease, when administered to patients who were affect-
ed in a manner so entirely analogous, in whom it operated more espe-
cially upon the diseased organs, and so entirely similar to the disease,
must necessarily increase the latter, even if the patient were endowed
with but a moderate degree of sensibility. To this au,zmentation of
symptoms, however, there commonly succeeded a rapid crisis and
perfect recovery; yet it sometimes proved so troublesome, as to call
for the employment of antidotes. This almost constant aggravation
of the disease, by the remedies which were chosen according to the
new law, threatened to embarrass very much their trial, if not to
render it wholly impracticable. To avoid these disagreeable results,
Hahnemann adopted the most simple and natural expedient, viz. that
of lessening the dose. He united one grain of the extract of Bella-
donna with a hundred drops of the spirits of wine. Of this mixture,
one drop (which of course contained Th part of a grain) he after-
wards gave, in the suitable cases, for a dose. But to his astonishment
he observed that this drop acted tooforcibly. He now made the great
stride which none had done previously to him; he took a hundred drops
of spirits of wine, added to them one drop, which contained Th ofa
grain of the medicine, shook them together, and, now had in every
drop of' the new mixture, therefore, the n\:u-15 part of a grain. If the
Th ofa grain was quite an unusual dose, Hahnemann went far beyond
the limits of previous experience in his second operation. viz. that of
administering the dose to the 1~ \:u-15 part of a grain. When he gave
one drop ofthis second preparation in a case adapted to the remedy,
he expected a very slight and inconsiderable effect. In the great rna-
. jority of cases, indeed, a more rapid cure followed it than in the case
ofthe preceding preparation, but to his great astonishment, much more
frequently-the same impetuous aggravation of symptoms. In short,
it was not to be mistaken : the virtue of the medicine had by no meant
been taken away in these high dilutions. How striking soever this
phenomenon was in itself, and however wonderful and strange it mu11t
have appeared to Hahnemann, it had, nevertheless, been ind1sputably

the result of his manipulations; and as a quiet observer of nature, he
proceeded, hand in hand with experienc:e, ~till. fu~ther. He added one
drop of his second (the ten thousandth) diiutron, to another one hun-
dred drops of spirits of wine, shook them together, and thus procured
a third mixture, in which each drop contained but the millionth part
of the first grain of the extract of Belladonna. On administering
this new preparation to his patients, he did not yet witness the desired
and expected decrease of medicinal energy, the remedy remained as
nctive as before, and in sensible children it operated frequently in
quite as drastic a manner as the extract had at first; nay, it appeared
as if it operated with even greater violence than before-and
therefore rendered necessary the exhibition of an antidote. Hahne-
mann. who knew that the st'crets of nature h'ld not yet been fully un-
veiled to us, and that any thing new and important, though ever so
striking, ifits truth be attested by repeated experiment, ought to be in-
vesti~ated, continued to prosecute this great discovery. He added
one drop of each successive dilution to a successive portion of one
hundred drops of spirits of wine, and united them by shaking. He
perceived in the progress of these manipulations, that every succes-
sive dilution was still operative, and though attenuated a hundred fold
at every step of the process, yet by no means did it become in the
same proportion a hundred fold leas efficient; in fact, each dilution
differed in activity, very little from the dilution immediately preced-
ing. He continued. therefore, these processes with the medicine, until
experience taught him, that it had, at length, become entirely mild in
its operation. The troublesome increase of the morbid symptoms be-
came gradually less and less considerableby dilution, nevertheless the
succeeding salutary effect remained equally decided, and even theex-
treme dilutions themselves, were always sufficient to effect a cure.
Remarking even from the thirtieth dilution, in very sensible subjects,
an increase of the symptoms; he diminished the dose from one drop of
this dilution, to a small portion of a drop. He discovered a mode by
which a drop could be accurately divided into any desired number of
parts, and from the -n}11 , and even a smaller fraction, decided effects
were witnessed from the medicine. ·
All other medicinal substances were found by him to be suscep-
tible of a preparation similar to that ofBelladonna. Not only those
belonging to the class of narcotics, which, in quantities, operate con-
fessedly as poisons. but all other medicines, which are ordinarily re-
garded as innocent~ he was obliged in the same manner to dilute in
order to convert them into mild remedies in the chosen cases.
Since Hahnemann defined (as before mentioned) so accurately the
kind of intermittent fever for which bark is a specific remedy, be re-
marked also, that the more suitable this medicine was to the case~ the
more frequently did it produce an unnecessary and troublesome in-
rrease of the symptoms. He therefore gradually lessened the dose
of this medicine from a single drop of the tincture to the hundredth,
thousandth, and millioneth dilution, and perceived dearly, lhat the
latter, far from being too weak, in very sensible subjects was unneces-
sarily strong; he therefore continued the dilutions at first as far as the
twelfth, and subsequently up to the thirtieth.

The medicinal virtue of insoluble mineral substail~ei was deve-
lo~d by Hahnemann, in the following manner: He took the sugar o(
mdk, it being an unmedicinal (or inert) vehicle, and triturated for there-
quisite time, one grain of the medicine generally, with a hund.red grains,
of that substance. Of this mixture, one grain being rubbed up w1th
another hundred grains ofthesu~ar ofmilk,gave thesecond Trituration;
in which every grain contained theum part of a grain of the origi-
nal medicine, &c. When in this manner he prepared mercury, and
at first gave the hundredth, and subsequently the ten-thousandth and
then the millionth, he perceived that the latter doses were not only
fully sufficient for the cure, but always acted with more rapidity and
mildness, and assaulted with less violence the patient.
Hahnemann now treated all other medicines which he employed,
after the same manner, and found the same principle confirmed alike1
in all. The virtues of none were thereby impaired, the dilutions wer~
alwa
..ys operative, and might effectively be carried further at pleasure .
Medicines which had undergone these operations, no longer possesse
those long continued effects of a prejudicial character, which we s
Trequently have to witness from the crude articles. Their operatio~
is always rapid, of short continuance, and without danger. If th~
opposition of the vital energies be inordinately excited by them, the1
salutary re-action is often protracted to an extraordinary length.--
Should this not be the case, the disc~ase subsides without anv antece~
dent perceptible aggravation. For, medicines do not become saluj
tary by their direct effects, such as are m~~;nifested in experiments o~
healthy subjects after strong and frequent doses, but they are salutary
by reason of their after operation, or rather of the counteraction of th~
organization-the infallible c:or.trariety which their secondary muse
bear towards their primary effects, and which must at the same timej
be equally opposed to the analogous action of the disease. '
Moreover, these dilutions were thus extraordinarily small in appear-
ance only: they were in fact operative by reason of the pure energy
proper to the medicine developed by art, and not by reason of the ori~
ginal matter of it. Hence they could not be too small or too weak ~
for it was shown in a manner not to be mistaken, that the proper me•
dicinal virtue was.by ·no means diminished in them, but, in thei~
lower ~rades it was at first unfolded and developed, and it wcs on)~
by their continuation that it began again to decrease. But as regards it~
capability of exciting the organization to salutary action, there wa~
never any diminution, it was still witnessed, even though the dilution~
were continued, until they reached some hundreds in number. In th~
higher dilutions, however, it was so modified, as more quickly to ex~
cite the organization to opposition, but the opposition cor.tinued for
shorter time. ·
When Hahnemann had made this great discovery, his important1
iflvestigations and trials of the new law of cure were much facilitated,:
after, to use his own words, he "had tremblingly, but fortunately,,
laid aside this hazardous way," and used the medicine in increasingly
smaller and finer doses: that is to say, had learned to employ the de-'
veloped virtue only. And now, after he had tested a ~reat numberj
of medicines in healthy subjects, and had investigated their pure ef-1
fects, he could interrogate experience in the diversified forms of dis-.

:ase. Then it was, that by innumerable facts, the truth of the great
aw of cure, and its universal applicability in disease, were unfOlded
o him. He perceived that it was a law of nature of genernl validity
n every case of disease, that that remedy is always the suitable one
ohich has the praperty of exciting in the healthy subject, such morbid
ymptoms as are the most similar to the natural disease. Therefore he
rave to the new method of cure the name of the hom(Eopathic, that is,
: method which employs remedies in exciting a similar affection. _
-·......
Meanwhile Hahnemann vigourously prosecuted his gigantic work,
md his enquiries were directed not only into the virtues hitherto un-
mown, of medicines, but also into the special application of the gene-
·allaw of cure to the multiplied forms of disease. Finally, at the age
>f fifty, he gave to the world, as the result of twenty years investiga·
~ion and experience, his Organon of Medicine, a work in which, he
tttempts theoretically to explain and demonstrate that law, indicates
:he manner of its application to individual cases of disease~ teaches ·
~he art of preparing medicines for this purpose, and offers the rules
1ccording to which the effects of tnedicines are to be investigated
1pon the system in health.
Beyond Germany this work remained for a long time wholly un·
(nown. Germany was not then reeognized as a. central point of li!era-
:ure, as it now begins to be, even in London and Paris. 'fhe labours of
the Germans,who constantly and eagerly borrow all that is most valua-
>Ie in the arts andsciences from the available sources of all times and of
rvery nation, were at that time misunderstood, .and their comprehen·
tive and disinterested enquiries into the labours of oth~rs, were mista-
Fen for meagerness of resources. In short, until a few years, this new
~nd important work, in common with many others, bevond Germany,
fvas known scarcely by name. In Germany itself, it was received
~vith real amazement. It found indeed, adherents and induced en-
iiuiry here and there among those not of the profession, but this was
1
1y no means the case among the mass of the literati, at least among
1he professors. Among the contemporary professor~ of medicine, of
.vhich therewere more than two hundred who received salaries in Ger·
111any,among all the hospital physicians, there was not one who was in-
iuced to study it. Before a smgle scientific enquirer of reputation
l1ad made any experiments, and thus investigated the truthof the new
Joctrine, the reviewers with very learned and subtile conclusions,
proved that the 'author's theories were good for nothing, were not at
~
I new, and that the small doses were ridieulous. This was the sum·
nd substance of all the reviews and counter-statements at that time,
nd remains to be so at the present day. To no purpose did Hahae-
ann urge to the investigation of the fundamental principles of his
doctrines by experiment-it was considered not at all worth the pains.
The German savans appeared sensible, that if both these propositioos
were established, if remedies should be chosen according to the simi-
larity of their symptoms to those of the disease, and hence must first
be proved in the healthy·subject, if they were sufficient as remedial
agents in such small and unheard-of doses, then all the learued lumber

which theorists had been accumulating for two thousand years must
fall to the ground. The multiplicity of theories and systems, and the
many hypothesis ac::,cording to .which it was so convenient to write
recipes, would be prostrated; physicians must again become students,
and that tltey were unwilling to do. Truly, we could not contemplate
the treatment which Hahnemann,the great benefactor of his race, has
received, without the greatest indignation, were we not reminded by
history~ that such has been the destiny of all the great discoverers of
new truths. Did we not know that it bas thus happened to Coper-
nicus and Galileo, to Columbus himself, anu Harvey, the great dis-
coverer of the circulation.
Amid the greatest opposition, however, a small band of faithful fol-
lowers assembled around Hahnemann, who aicled his enquiries by their
experiments with medicines on their own persons. A few years after
· the appearance of the Organon, he began to publish his Materia
Medica, in which all the morbid symptoms of the most important me-
dicines were cited, symptoms which had been ascertained by experi-
ments on the healthy subject. Thus was this great man, supported
in a measure only by ·those few disciples, obliged to proceed in his
immensely painstaking labour, yet ten years after the appearance of
the Organon. Slowly in the meantime, bad the numoor of his dis-
ciples increased, which though small, was yet strong through convic-
tion, strong by the power of the truth which they had acknowledged.
At this time, (1821) a new period dawns upon us.
In consequence of the united intrigues of the apothecaries and phy-
sicians in Leipzig, Hahnemann was now obliged to leave that city,
wherein he had for the space of thirty years, been elaborating his
new art, where he had practised it successfully, and where he had
publicly taught, and gained his disciples. The Jaws which prohibit
the dispensingof medicines by physicians, under a heavy penalty, and
permit it only to the privileged apothecaries, were brought to bear
~ainst him. Hahnemann who always gave the simple medicine, in
·hiS entirely novel preparations, in ~hich an extraordinarycare and ac-
curacy were indispensable, could not possibly commit this labor, upon
which the certainty of the result, and the welfare of his patients de-
pended, to the apothecaries; who, not at all familiar in such unheard
of niceties, regarded the whole business as absurd, and whose pecu-
niary interests had to suffer thereby, quite as much as the pecuniary
interests of the patients were benefited. When, therefore, in SJ?ite of
his defence, the judges wrested the dispensation laws against h1m, he
would no more practice in opposition to the laws, and m his old age
he left his native land, obeyed the call ofa German prince (who grant-
ed him the privilege of practising his profession in his dominions) and
went to the duke of Anhalt Coethen.
The apothecaries and professors at Leipzig now triumphed, and sup-
posed that the mischief which threatened their utter ruin would soon
be entirely abolished. Instead of which, however, Hahnemann's dis-
C'.iples and adherents united themselves for the faithful defence of the
tr
. uth, and a great number of practising physicians resolved on the
publication of a periodical for Homceopathic Medicine. Dr. Ernst
Stapf, present counsellor ofmedical affmrs, placed himselfat the head 1
of this enterprize, and conducted it with such circumspection and ani-

mated it with such spirit and zeal, that this journal soon became an
important means, as well to unite all the scattered friends of the cause
to a mutual co-operation, as to operate beneficially abroad, to pro-
mote the extension and acknowledgement.of the new doctrines, and
for their constant and energetic defence against enemies. Violent ac-
~usations and invectives, and defences as firm and resolute now en-
sued. But day by day also new adherents were acquired, mostly
among the older practitioners; a phenomenon in .new systeTIUI, entirely
unheard of. Their"attention became arrested by the numerous cures,
and when they took the trouble to make themselves so far ac-
quainted with the thing as to be able to interrogate experience, they
must in every instance have become convinced, for experience eon-
firmed every declaration of Hahnemann.
But particularly the eyes of the public became more opened at this
time. At first they had taken no part whatever in the medical con-
. troversy ; they had been accustomed to these endless contentions, and
therefore gave themselves no trouble about it. The most judicious
of them knew but too well, in what a condition the whole art of me-
dicine was situated, and that in the ~reater number of cases, in chro-
nic diseases at least, it was more ratiOnal to do nothing at all, and bear
their complaints with patience, than to acquire an additional disease
by- the use of medicines. But the language of Hahnemann and of his
dtsciples, which continually urged to a trial ofthe new doctrines, and
rejected all theoretical opposition ; but above all, the many extraordi-
nary cures, awakened an increasing attention. Several intelligent
non-professional individuals, among whom were numbered some of
distinguished rank and reputation, raised their voices and instructed
their fellow citizens concerning the new phenomenon, ns a matter
of high importance for every one; spoke of the complicated state of
the old system of medicine, of the want of unity and concord, which
must necessarily prevail therein, of the obstinate refusal of the other
physicians to interrogate experience and make trials with the new me-
thod of cure, of the natural simplicity and truth of the new doctrines,
and the consequent unanimity of their adherents. Numerous publi-
cations were thrown before the people, nor wns it long before patient•
obliged their physicians to the study of the despised doctrines ; whole
cities, indeed, were individually united in calling homreopathie phy•i-
cians within their precincts, to be remunerated at thecommon expen.e.
Physicians in several parts of Germany soon did homage to the.new
art, its light even penerated into Austria, and was diffused through-
out Hungarv. It was carried to Naples, and in that kingdom gained
stedfast adherents. In Denmark, also, as well as in Sweden and Hol-
land, men of high reputation commenced the translation of Hahne-
mann's writings. It acquired numerous friends in France, particular-
ly in Lyons, and in Geneva, where .a homreopathic periodical publica-
tion, in the French language, has already made its appearance. The
physician in ordinary of a Russian princess, carried the new doc-
trines into the wilds of Russia, whence at a subsequent period, a
Russian nobleman has communicated observations of extraordina-
ry value to the new system. This beneficent art has also confirmed
its truth in the vilified diseases of the West India tropics ; and many
investigations to which nature gave occasion i~ these regions, were

not without their influence. Even from Erorpt, that land ofmonsters.
the missionaries extol the new art, and resound its praises from the
sanguinary Gold coast. · ·
In England and in the United States little is heard of the new art.
They have scarcely begun to hear of the medical refor111ation even
rising up before them. Some reviewers only within a few years past.
have noticed the writings for and against Homreopathia. These coun-
tries have conducted with the utmost quietude and discretion. In
both, the physicians of which, for the most part, are governed more
by experience than by theories, it has been admitted, that if the sys-
tem were true, it would lead to highly important consequences. Yes,
certainly experience would long since have been appealed to on the
subject,ifalas! the almost general unacquaintancewith theGerman lan-
guage among the better classes (one ofthe most important languagesfor
the arts and sciences,) had not hiadered that result. Soon indeed, will
this defect be supplied by translations, but may we not hope that the
period is not far distant when, in the United States at least, the worth
of German science and of the language of Germany will be generally
acknowledged? May the day soon appear in whir.b the rich and for-
tunate inheritance oftwo thousand years of European culture, uniting
the practical views of the English with the ardent zeal of the French,
embrace also the depth and solidity of the German, so that whatever
Europe may produce hereafter of greatness in science, may, without
difficulty be here appreciated in this central point of the future history
of man.

While thus with blessings on its wings, the great discovery reached
to every quarter of the earth, the master was silent, and his disciples
imagined that he now reposed upon his laurels. But the old philoso-
pher did not rest, and while his hair was growing ~rey upon his head,
enriched with science, enriched with experience, his mind still retain-
ed its youthful vigour, and he boldly penetrated still deeper into the
mysteries of nature. When an old man, at the age of seventy-three,
he suddenly surprized his astonished admirers with a new and great
work, which far transcended all preceding discoveries, and more than
redoubled the power of the homreopathic physician. It was a work
On the Cure ofChronic Diseases, the fruit of twelve years diligence;
a communication concerning a new and most important species of
remedies, a treasury of new observations and experience scarcely
to be overlooked, with entirely new and peculiar directions for the
employment of these remedies in disease. These new observations
were soon confirmed on aU sides, ·and this great increase of resources
for the new healing art, acquired for it, every where, also a numerous
accession of new adherents.
A aecondjournal, in addition to that ofDr. Stapf, likewise soonmade
its appearance,devoted exclusively to the practice, followed by a third,
besides a .newspaper for the people,and lastly,at the same time with the
French J'ournal, before mentioned, a fourth in the German language,
intended speedily to extend the knowledge of new discoveries. In
tbeee and in a number of other publications, details of diversified ex-
perience were communicated, and the most interestingdiscoveries and

observations were ac~umulated, concerning the employment of reme-
dies in particularly difficult cases. By these means, this, till recently,
youthful art, soon attained the vigour of manhood, and now stalks
forth with peaceful intrepidity through the world, certain of its vic-
tory over all other methods of cure.
We will now glance at the elevation to which Homceopathic Medi-.
cine has reached at the present day, five years since the appearance
of the work on chronic diseases.
-·.......
Exoeriments with medicines upon the healthy subjec--t, as the basis
of the'whole structure, have now been made with about two hundred
agents, and the most important medicinal energies of nature have
been investigated. The works devoted to them are of such extent,
that their study appertains to the most laborious within the realm of
human knowledge. Not onlY. o.re the more important remedies of the
old school investigated, but many others; and besides this, most won-
derful discoveriesnave been made. Substances in which not the smal-
lest medicinal virtue had been recognised, as metalit: gold, silver and
. platina, silicea, alumina, strontiana, selenium, several plants, the juice
of the sepia, and many other animal substances, are ranked among
the most important remedies. Old and effete medicines have thereby
been elevated to their deserved rank, and in cases adapted for them
are now without a substitute: for example, Lycopodium, Bryonia,
Pulsatilla, Anacardium, Euphrasia, &c. Medrcines which had sel-
dom been used, and only for minor purposes, as Sem : Santonici and
Sabadilla, Spiselia and Staphisagria, Mazeriumand Cocculus are now
recognised as mdispensable remedies in the most dangerous disease~t.
Plants whose efficacy as remedies had been unknown, as Nerium Ole·
ander, Ledum Palustre,Cyclamen Europaeum, Cannabis Sativa, Ca-
ladium Seguinum, Drosera Rotundifolia and Lycoperdon Bovista are
introduced into the medical store, and in part recognised as specifics,
in some of the worst of diseases. Medicines which had been abused as
insignificant domestic remedies,MatricariaChamomilla, (the field Cha-
momile of Europe,) and Sambucus, Chelidonium and Ruta, are now
received as highly valuable curative means in very different, but in
closely defined cases; others, as Cinchona and Arnica, Ipecacuanha and
Tartar Emetic display now, for the first, the whole compass of their
curative energies and relations to disease, before wholly unsuspected;
by virtue of which, for nample, Cinchona may be usefully employed
in many violent cases of tooth-ache, Arnica in biles, Ipecacuanha
in the convulsions of children, Tartar Emetic in Coma, &c. Nux
Vomica and Ignatia of which scarcely any use was made, from igno-
rance of their virtues, now developed them in such abundance, that
they became necessary remedies of daily use. But the most extra-
ordinary ofall, were the effects displayed by the simple earths and
salts, when their virtues were duly developed. (Potenzirt.) Never
had it occured to a physician to employ flint as a remedy, and he
would not at all know for what he could administer it. But Bah·
nemann, who supposed peculiar virtues resided in particular substan-
ces, has by means of his experiments, elevated Silex amona the mot&..

important of all remedies. Among other diseases, it is quite indis-
pensable in scrophula, inflamed swellings, ulcers, caries, diseases or
the eyes, &c. In it, as·well as in alumine, the salts and other sub~
stances, the wonderful disc~very of unfolding medicinal virtues by
trituration and agitation; was displayed in all its magnitude. The pure
earths of Silex, of Alumine, &c., operate not at all, for example, on the
healthy subject. When a grain of either had been triturated with a
hundred grains of sugar of milk, and hence raised to the first deve-
lopement of,power, it yet produced no effect. Hundreds would now
have desisted from all further investigation of its supposed virtues,
But not so Hahnemann. He took a grain of the first trituration,
which ofcourse contained'the hundredth of a grain of the substance
under investigation, and rubbed this with another hundred llfRins of
sugar of milk, elevating it to the second degree ofdevelopement, or as
it may be denominated, to the second power. It still had no effect.
·Taking now a grain of the second trituration, he raised it to the third
power. It still produced scarcely any effect upon the healty subject,
and the little which it did develope, could hardly be confided in. It
was then raised as high as the sixth power ; and in this state of high
de'velopment every grain contained but a billionth part ofthe original
matter first submitted to experiment. But now its energies were de-
veloped, and displayed so penetrating and powerful an influence upon
the healthy subject of experiment, that the trials with it, appertained
to the most difficult and assaulting, so that higherdevelopments were
obliged to be made for further experiments ; and for remedial pur-
poses the developments were continued up to the thirtieth power.-
Thus was this, to all appearance entirely inert substance first convert-
ed into one of most extraordinary energy, and by further elaboration
into a bland and innocent medicinal agent. By means of these Trit-
urations and Dilutions, so called, it was the matter only which became
so minutely divided, but it was the energy, the virtue only, which was
thereby so astonishingly unfolded. It was now manifest that the pro-
per energies ofall medicines were unfolded by trituration and agitation,
and that by the extension of the matter of them, their energies, be-
fore latent, became sensible, free and disenthraled. With still greater
clearness was this established by the important fact observed by
Hahnemann, viz. that when the process of Trituration or Agitation
was too long continued, the energy of the medicine became too in-
tensely raised, and he therefore exactly prescribes how long the trit-
uration with sugar of milk is to be continued, and how often the vials
in which a drop is united with a hundred drops of spirits of wine,
must be shaken, in order to obtain a remedy perfectly mild in its
operation upon the patient. These preparations ought not therefore
to be transmitted from place to place in a fluid state, because their
energy is liable to be excessively increased by the long continued,
though moderate agitation, which they thus undergo.
-·-
But all these observations with medicines were.but the basis ofthe
new edifice. Still much more was necessary in order to be able to
· ·cure patients by these means. Among other things, Hahnemann wa1 ·

obliged to strike out a new path in the doctrine of diseases, in which
the fil'llt step was, totally to reject all hypothesis at the bed side of
the patient, concerning nature, essense, and the supposed concealed
seat of the disease. And this was done, ~ot only because these sup-
positions, (of which every physician may have one ptJculiar to him-
self, the truth of which can be determined o~ly when too late, name-
ly, after the demise of the patient,) might in many cases be prejudi-
cial to the patient. but because they became no longer necessary~
The symptoms only in their integrity were necessary, and upon them
the enti1-e cure could be safely grounded. Nothing, indeed, but the
symptoms are to be accepted as a ~uide to the treatment of the disease,.
because, in them alone, no error IS possible: · For just as clear of all
conjecture,just as much by faithful observation alone, as was the case
in acquiring a knowledge ofthe virtues of medicines, must a knowledge
of every case of disease be acquired. Be the name of the disease
what it mny, it is nothing to the purpose, and is without any influ-
ence upon its treatment. But so much the more ·necessary is it, that
every case of disease should be completely comprehended in all its
symptoms and with great accuracy. Hahnemann therefore urges
upon his pupils the propriety ofaddicting themselves to close think-
ing, by the study of the Mathematics, of qualifying themselves for
mmute observation, by the study of natural history, and when possi-
ble also by the art of drawing, for the purpose of sharpening the sight
to close observation, but in an especial manner by testing the effects of
medicines in their own persons. -
While he recognized anatomical and physiological knowledge as by
aU means indispensable, he admitted the study generally, of the pl'e·
vailing systems of medicine, on account of the historical knowledge
and of controversies with other physicians. Yet he makes the gene-
ral pathology as taught hitherto, and the greater part of the special,.
altogether unnecessary at t.he bed side of the patient. He regulates
the examination of the sick according to entirely new views, in order
that a clear, genuine, undisturbed and perfect idea may always be
formed of the disease. The idea of the disease must, indeed, attain a
degree of perfection such as has neTer hitherto been considered ne-
cessary by physicians. Hahnemann requires, therefore, as a matter
not to be overlooked, the writing down on every occasion, at the bed
side of the patient, all his symptoms; indeed, with an accuracy hith-
erto unheard of, he commits. to writing all the complaints of the pa-
tient, in the V'erbal expressions of the latter, and t~se ~re to be includ-
ed in the idea of the disease. Nor is it less novel·that he requires the
seat of every symptom to be exactly and expressly defiried, even if, ac-
cording to our present anatomical knowledge, this would appear un-
necessary. With the same accuracy is the kind of pain to be noted, '
and he always carefully records the expressions by which the kind of
pain is the most strictly desi~nated. All the circumstances under
which any complaint arises or disappears, increases or diminishes;

count. Sensations on falling asleep, during sleep and on waking,

the posture during sleep; even the dreams and the kind of thep1, whe.
ther of falling, of flying, offire, of n~ises,of hunger, of moti9n, ofsee·
ing frightful objects, &c., all belong to the image of the disease, and
any one of which, may not unfrequently be the deciding symptom. In
every case of disease also, the symptoms proper to any particular
organ, whether these symptoms be chronic or ·of shorter duration
must be designated. Hahnemann was the first physician who recog·
nized it as indispensable in every disease, to· regard man as a whole.
The fact may scarcely be credited, but it does not appear that this
method had ever occurred to any other physician before Hahnemann.
It had always been deemed sufficient to know the symptoms which
were manifested by the organs particularly affected, or by de~ndent
organs and these were the symptoms which were supposed to belong
to the existing disease, while all others were foreign to it. As, how·
ever, man has but one nervous system, and is as quickly susceptible
of impressions on the small toe, as on the eye, and moves as quickly
the former as the latter, at pleasure, as the blood streams through
the whole body at every pulsation of the heart, no part can become
disordered without affecting the system at large, and a part has an
influence upon the whole as the whole has upon a part.
Hahnemann absolutely requires the comprehension of all the mor·
bid symptoms of every patient, whether they be connected or not, or
whether the connection can or cannot be pathologically pointed out:
First, because he regards the human system as integral, the parts of
which, as such, are not exclusively affected, but whose diseases are
always general, and must be always cured by the vital forces directed
against them. Secondly, because a knowledge ofall the symptoms is
, necessary, as well as of the constitution and temper of mind, m order
that among the many remel'!ies the most suitable may be selected.
This may be illustrated by a small example: Suppose a patient came
under treatment for incipient amaurosis. Few physicians would be
likely to regard, as of any importance, a slight eruption on the fore·
head occuring on the same pati(lDt, and still fewer a small wart of long
standing upon the right check-nor would their attention be directed
to a weakness of the right ankle, nor proneness of the same to frequent
sprains. If, besides, the fatient were affected with borborygmi, few
certainly would think o connecting with amaurosis these various
symptoms, which are all, nevertheless, deviations from a healthy con·
dition; but Hahnemann requires this union as absolutely neces~~&ry.
· When a morbid symptom is pre~nt in the body he requires to know .
1
on which side it is seated. Occasion is hereby given i'n the present
case, to find a new symptom, which otherwise would not hv.ve been I
perceived, namely, that it is the right side which principally lluffers. '
Unmindful of mternal connections between the symptoms whether I
they subsist or not, regardless whether they be unfolded in a very
interesting manner, as they might be, or not, the morJ>id symptoms
are to be marshalled according to their relative value, and the same
rank must obtain amon~ the medicinal symptoms of the remedy, as I
among the symptoms of the disease, and should bear a strict corres·
pondence in grade as well assimilarity, to those of the latter. Regard
being paid to the patient's mental constitution and temper, andespeci·
ally to the psoric origin of the disease, to his previous diseases, and re-
Digitized by Coogle
medies already used, we very readily find the most fitting reme-
dies which must exert a verv favourable influence over the condi-
tions of the case above described. The opposing vital forces infalli-
bly awakened b~ it, will be directed against the general disease,
against the morbid tendency, in consequence of which all the above
~ited svmptoms have arisen. As soon as the opposition excited
by one inedic:ine has ceased, it is to be followed up by other re-
medies, according to circumstances, and the cure graduallv completed.
Now, if a part only of the symptoms in this case were taken into con-
sideration, for instance, merely the incipient amaurosil and psoric
origin, the choice of a remedy would be exceeding:ly precarious. For ·
webave very many remedies suitable for Mtese symptoms, proved by
trials on the healthy subject. Causticum,a newly discoveredsubstance,
by Hahnemann, ar.d Phosphorus, are very important remedies when
prepared after the manner ofthe other Homreopathic medicines, some-
times Graphites also, and Petroleum, Kali, Natrum and other salts.
Resides, almost any of the earths, as Silicea, Alumina, Magnesia, Cal-
caria might be chosen in the case. Among the metals, Gold and An-
timony; among plants: Lycopodium clavatum, Agaricus muscarius,
Assafcetida and Conium maculatum, nod in some cases, Cannabis
and Colocynthis. Ruta also and Cinchona may in some cases be ser-
viceable, as well as Dulcamara and Belladonna. But only one among
all these remedies, when all the complicated symptoms !lre regarded,
will be found perfectly suitable. Whether the cure succeed or not,
the patient will not in the least degree be incommoded with medicine,
much Jess will injurious consequences ensue, nor will he be subjected
(if it be not ofan unusual character) to important changes in his cus-
tomary diet. There never yet has been any other method of cure
than the homreopathie, by which such results, produced with so much
safety and eertamty, and with so little inconvenience to the patient,
could have bOOn possible.
It might perhaps be further declared as ridiculous and unscientific,
that the Hahnemannean physicians should attach so much importance-
to the merest trifles, and even parade them at length on paper: in fe-
vers, for instance, they carefully enquire whether thirst takes place
before! during, or after the chill, fever, or sweating stage; whether
the chill and heat alternate, whether they are general or local, simul-
taneous, internal or external, what the order of their succession, with
what other symptoms they are associated, &c. In tooth-ache,whether
it occurs in the right or left side, above or below, in one tooth or·seve-
ral, whether the pain passes into other parts and where; whether it
occurs at a particular time ofday; whether it is excited, aggravated,
diminished or removed, on any particular occasion, as by warm or
cold air, warm or cold applications, warm or cold food or drink, by
rest or motion, by smoking tobacco, the use of coffee, or wine, l:ty
mental exertion, or by particular mental emotions. In the case of a
small cutaneous eruption of the arms and feet: whether the right more
than the left side is affected, whether it occur more on the out than
.inside, more about a joint, or more distant from it.
But, indeed,this observationoftrifles, which physicians have hither:-
to wholly overlooked, this careful collection of even the most insigni-
ficant and apparently unimpot·tant circumstances, as is here required.

has been reckoned of the hlghest conseq11ence in all other sciences
which claim any pretension to the title of exact. Every one knows
that the chemistry of the present day emerged from its early and rude
condition to its present greatness and splendour, by reason ofthe great
attention which was bestowed upon minutire. Such is the case also
in physics, and how otherwise would the extraordinary discoveries of
Oerstedt ever have arisen, spreading over all human sciences an
entirely new light. This attention to minutia has long since renovated
Anatomy and Zootomy. Folly only would esteem it ridiculous, should
a great anatomist in the eyes of men, make the discovery of a nervous
filament, which had been overlooked by preceding observers; for,
.every sr.ientific man knows that it may hereafter be of great impor-
1.ance, and that an accurateknowledge ofthe smallest parts, contributes
1o the knowledge of the whole. No physician would disregard the dis-
IC:Overy, though its practical utility should not become manifest for
years.
What surprising and im?Ortant acquisitions have the Botanists
made to general science, by the discovery ofthe wonderful regularity
of the structure ofthe smallest cryptogamous plants, wholly unnoticed
in the observations of Linnreus! And should not the United States ·
beproud of the discoveries of their Schweinitz?who in this new world,
after years of diligent investigation, first established the fact, that the
same laws, even in those microscopic figures, preniled in both hemis-
pheres; and plants which appear like grey points upon a diseased
leaf, now solve the sublime problem of the laws of vegetable forma-
tion, which are recognized from those points up to the loftiest trees,
and the most gorgeous flowers.
An entirely new mineralogy has arisen inour days, bythe measure-
ment of the smallest fascets and angles of crystalline formations. In
short, by careful attention to minutia? a new era has dawned upon 1!-11
the natural sciences. Wherefore then should the physician in his patho-
logy henceforth overlook things apparently insignificant? Surely even
now, though nothing at present be added to the contributions ofHah-
nemann, a new period has dawned upon pathology, as well as on all
the certain sciences; and in future time, the new pathology will as far
excel the old, as do the natural sciences of the present period those
of the last century.
But at the bed side of the patient the horn<llOpathic physician is un-
mindful of this future science. His sole enquiry i's after the symp·
.toms, because the symptoms alone determine his choice of the remedy,
and upon the fulness and accuracy with which the~ are noted, rests
the entire management of the cure. All therefore depends upon the
correct examination of the patient, but not upon any possible opinions
concerning the nature and essence of the disease, nor upon learned
views concerning its concealed seat. The symptoms must be ar-
ranged indeed, with science and skill, in wich the genuine experimen-
tal propositions of the old semiotics and special pathology are of weat
utility ; but this admits not of comparison with the mode of procedure
hitherto adopted in medicine, wherein general experience, or hypothe-
sis only, determined the choice of remedies. · Hence the examination
of the patient according to Hahnemann's directions, is an affair of
no little difficulty even to the most learned and practised physician,

As soon as the nomreopathic physician has sought out the image of
the disease in the manner above described, his next business consists
in selecting out of all his remedies, t~at particular one, w~ic~ cc;mi-
prehends all the symptoms of the pattent m the greatest S1mJiar1ty,
not only as respects the mere number, symptom for symptom, but aiBd
according to their different grades or relative value. He should al-
ways be convinced that the remedy which he selects is better suited
to the CaSe than any other, which, among ttie numerous remedies and,
the extensive ra6ge of the curatiye virtues possessed by many o(
them, is nd easy busihess. To this frequently difficult arid careful
selection belongsail extehsive acquaintance with medical observations,
and a dose study of the idiosyncrasies (peculiarities) of the patierlt.
A mistake cannot, however, be easily committed in such selection; tih-
cauSE! it rhpst, after all, depend up6n the necessary similarity of the
symptoms of die patient with thi>se of the remedy. Injury cannot
indeed result from a false selection; for it is soon to be discovered,
and is free from all dangerous consequences to the t>atieni. But in
order to effect a rapid cure, to avoid a false selection, and to be con-.
':inced of th~ correctnes~ ?f the se~ection by a clos~ co~parison, muc~
t1me and patns are requtstte, particularly m chrl>mc d1seases. Even
with the advantage t>f several years practice, ttigether with a com-
prehensive knowledge of the remedies, it often requires longand care-
ful consideration and an unwearied search and comparison of the im-
age ofthe symptoms presented by the disease, with the image ofthose
presented by the medicine. The time between visiting the patient
and dispensing the medicine is therefore the most anxious to the
homooopathic physician, and his callin~ is a far more difficult one than
that of the ordi.nary practitioner. W1th all his knowledge of the vi~­
tues of remed1es he would be able to treat but a small number o(
patients, if the great mass ofexperience which is constantly. coinriui-
Jiicated from all sides, embodiea and daily increased, did not very
much facilitate the seleetiori. This experience already extends to all
aiseases, and particularly to the most serious, because these more
frequently come under the observation ofthe homreopathic physician.
The most acute and dangerous diseases, as inflammation of the lungs,
'pleurisy, inflammation of the brain and liver, and of the ear, appo-
plexy and convulsions, most of the diseases of children, and even the
most mali~nant forms of typhus, are the easiest of all in the choice
of a remedy. For, the multiplied experience with regard to them,
has ascertained so precisely the remedy for every case, particularly
cases of the most threatening nature, which ~U1te immediate relief,
that he who is acquainted with the latter, can immediately select
the suitable medicine. As this on the one hand facilitates the choice
of the appropriate remedy' in all acute diseases, so, on the other, i~
chronic diseases, thefrequently very protracted rea~tion ofthe organi-
zation following the exhibition ofa rightly selected medicine, renders
it practicable lor the homreopathic physician to visit a larger number
of patients than it would otherwise be possible. But so ovel'Whelm~
ing a practice as many physicians of the old method have, in whicli
t~ey enjoy the advantage of short visits, and quickly writing a ~

Hahnemann not only instituted a new method of examining the
sick, and an entirely new Thcrapeutica, but also a new Diatetica.
He gave to this important doctrine, which before him was composed
on no certain principles, the first scientific basis. Opponents, who
must have perceived this, cast upon him the ridiculous reproach, that
he cured his pati~nts by diet alone. Rarely, however, having all the
aclvantage of the same diet, could they imitate Hahnemann in his
cures. Nay, they carried the dieting system almost to starvation, a
wholly unnatural proscription, yet it rendered them no assistance,
and quite as little benefited their patients. Hahnemann's entire sys-
tem of diet, besides his psycho-diatetic precepts, wholly peculiar to
himself, consists in removing from the patient all foreign medicinal in-
fluences, in order that the medicines ~pven, may act in as undisturbed
a manner as possible. Experiments performed on the healthy subject
had taught him, that aromatics of every kind are endowed with pe-
culiarly active properties, as well as medicines, properly so called,
and exert on the imimal economy an influence, which, though it may
become imperceptible from habit, nevertheless exists, and is capable
Of disturbing the.action of many remedies. As the result ofthese in•
vestigalions, several ofthe aromatics were even classed by him among
important remedial. agents; among these may be enumerated Coffee1
Saffron and Parsley, Capsicum and Tobacco. Moreover, in the course
· of his investigations, he discovered that somearticles possessed the pro-
perties of antidotes; thus vinegar was found incompatible with some
remedies, wine with others, coffee with others, &c. These articles
would therefore naturally be interdicted, when they happen to be in-
compatible with the remedies prescribed for the patient. Among other
things, Hahnemann also observed the prejudicial influence of the flesh
of swine and of other animals inhabiting marshy places, in diseases
of the abdominal viscera and of the skin; nor were the effects of very
.young animals, or Of milk recently taken from the cow less injurious,
and these articles of food were, therefore, prohibited indiseases of or•
gans upon which they exercised a morbid influence. All his direc-
tions reg~t_rding the regimen, consist entirely ofexperimental proposi-
tions; they constitute, indeed, a strictly complete and scientific fabric,
as respects the ideal of a per(ect manner of living, but the prescrip-
tions in individual cases, are modified according to circumstance111.
The more violent the attack of disease, the more does a strict avoid-
ance of all foreign medicinal influences become necessary ; but
when it pa•·tal~:es more of a chronic character, the necessity for
changes in the customary manner of living is proportionably dimin-
ished. In most chronic cases, indeed, nothing more is necessary than
abstinence from gross excess, and caution in the use of aromatica.
All pure unadulterated drinks may be used in moderation, as well as
the customary spires, together with salt, sugar and vinegar, coffee,
bJack tea, tobacco, &c. But the use of brandy and other spirituous
liquors is in all cases to be refrained·from, or if already become ha-
bitual, it must be gradually discontinued. Hahnemann considers all
$pirituous drinks positively injurious, and that the cure is obstructed
by their use. The internal or external employment of all other me-
dicines and domestic remedies, even those of n reputed harmless char·
.a~ter, and as much as possible, all strong odors, as perfumery and
Digitized by Coogle
~
other mbstances used for their aroma, is to be avoided, because they
are capable of producin~ prejudicial disturbances, and none more so
titan musk. Moderate mdulgence in other things is not prohibit-
ed. Hahnemann has never forbidden the use of animal food, or pre-
scribed n thin penurious diet, unless on the day su.cceetiing that of
overloading the stomach with food. Never has it occurred to him to
think of curing the patient by means of diet alone.
-·-
Thus has Hahnemann beaten a new path on all sides. His admi.
rable observations and manifold experience have constantly advanced
the new art created by his instrumentality, and every year brings
with it fresh proofs of his genius. He has discovered a numerous,
useful and widely efficient class of remedies against.Chronic Diseases,
whereby the most of these complaints, when they have not been seri-
ously impaired by the abuse of medicines, and becomein\'eterate, can
be perfectly cured. Against the mercurial disease;· that ~rtificial
plague of the present day, he has discovered several new remedies,
so that this multiform and too frequently incurable complaint1 cat1 .at
)east be ameliorated and the more intolerable of its symptoms as-
esuaged. Against Sycosis a disease allied to Syphilis, and hitherto to-
tally incurable, he has discovered a specific remedy in the American
Thuya. Against the genuine Scarlet fever of Sydenham, as already
mentioned, he has discovered a remedy in Belladonna; against Pur-
pura miliaris, Colfea and Aconite ; against many forms of Measles,
Pulsatilla; against the Hooping cough, Drosera; against Croup, Spon·
gia mar: tost; against Raphania, which sometimes rages pestilentially
in Europe, and 8nce here in Albany, produced by secale cornutum
he discovered the most s~dv and certain remedy in Solanum Ni-
grum; a~ainst the often prevalent and mortal autumnal dsyentery, the
specific Mere: cor: sub. He also determined the infallible remedy
against the camp plague of 1813, in the malignant forms of Tvphus
generally, and in most violent fevers. One ofhis most important dis.
coveries, however, was a specific remfldy against all pure inftamation. ·
particularly that ofthe lungs, and in Pleurisy;whereby the hazardous,
always debilitating, and commonly but apparently useful operation of·
bloodletting, can be altogether dispensed with.
But a real triumph of this new method of cure was Hahnemann's
recent project ofthe specific remedies against the most violent and
malignant forms of cholera. It consisted in the use of camphor, par-
ticularly against the Cholera Asphyxia, and cuprum against that at·
tended with clonic spasms. But in the ordinary cases and in
Cholerine he :did not deem it necessary· to recommend any reme-
dies, to the notice of his disciples, because all physicians who
trusted to Homreopnthia, though living in countries widely remote
from each other, found of them~ves the same specific remedies.
_However varied were its forms in the different ~ountries and·
in different individuals, and as multiform and strange and malis·
nant as it was, they cured in Russia as well as in Hungary, m
Vienna and Prague as well as in Berlin, in Philadelphia, as well
as in Germany with equal success. The most recent statementl

bomceopathic physicians, as soon as they saw the patients an~

among the first who are thoroughly won to th~ truth of the new art,
the important benefits of which, our grand children o.nly will reap to
their full extent. May our beneficent Society largely contribute to
the wider prevalence and reception of the Hahnemannean doctrines ;
may that which single individuals can ofthemseh·es scarcely achieve,
be effectuated by united efforts; then in this blessed country, may
the miseries of disease be diminished, future generations be rescued

!i!pite of all adversaries, in spite of impediments, it will neverthe-
less succeed here sooner than in Europe; for, among a free peo-
ple, who with practised eyes, soon discern the truly useful, a
treasure like this new Art, must quickly be estimated in a degree
~ommensurate with its real value ; sooner than by the kings and
princes of Europe, who have other and more important cares; soor.er
than in those countries where ancient institutions and prescriptive
interests are suppor~ed by a vigilant police, who impede the progress
of the new Art by processes, penalties and bayonets. Here we are
beyond their influence. The American people demand facts, and
\lpon these we can confidently and securely rest for our support. The
language of opposition m.ay be employed &W!inst it, but truth is not
long obscured here.by forms of speech.-The victory will be ours;
and in a century to come the anniversary of our society,-this first
etep upon the way which must lead to the public and general acknowl-
~dgement of the new doctrines,-will be solemnized with grateful re-
membrance. So great an aim, indeed, cannot be attained without
labour, but we are prepared to undertake it; we shall not arrive at
it without conflict, but we stand equipt for conflict; we shall not reach
it without defamation; but we will suffer ridicule and defamation
with composure.
"So slowly does truth fi)rce its way in opposition to existing preju-
~ices and interests, that we dare not indul~e the hope of seeing such a
reformation accomplished in our days. Yet a little impulse is some-
times sufficient to set in motion the stream of public opinion, which
gathering force year after year, from continual accessions ofexperi-
~nce and reflection swells at last into an irresistable current, and .
