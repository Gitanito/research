 This was a nosegay of snippets from the current occult and New Thought literature, a "monthly compendium of the contemporaneous thoughts and writings of the world on mental science and occultism," as it touted itself (Adept, February 1900).  It carried short excerpts on Psychology, Mental Science, Hypnotism and Mesmerism, Telepathy and Clairvoyance, Spiritism and Theosophy, Astrology, Palmistry and Phrenology, etc., as well as ghost stories, astrological predictions, and the like.   It published short book reviews of new books and pamphlets and carried lists of the current journals in its fields (more than 100 in 1901).  Sheerin (1871-1914) first appeared in advertisements in Sydney Blanshard Flower's Hypnotic Magazine in 1897 as "Medical Superintendent" of The Cleveland School of Suggestive Therapeutics, which offered its services in treating addictions (alcohol, morphine, tobacco -- despite the fact that Sheering himself was addicted to morphine), sexual disorders, etc.  Sheerin was joined in his efforts at the School by Thomas Jay Hudson, proponent of the thesis of the "two minds in man," and almost certainly was a graduate of Herbert A. Parkyn's Chicago School of Psychology, which was advertised prominently in the journal.  The journal carried advertisements for all of the leading practitioners of suggestive therapeutics at the time: C.O. Sahler (Kingston, New York), George C. Pitzer (St. Louis), Thomas Basset Keyes (Chicago), et al., and for many lesser-known proponents of similar methods, and advertisements for the likes of R.E. Dutton, the New York Institute of Science ("Would you become a Man of Mark?"), the American College of Sciences (Philadelphia), O Hashnu Hara's Wings of Truth, Henry Frank, Charles W. Close, Mabel Gifford, D.D.S.(!), etc.  Noted in Banner of Light 88/7 (October 13, 1900): 4; in "List of Advance Thought Publications," in the New Cycle, March 1900, 159-60, and in Weltmer's Magazine, 1901.
