I was going to go out to dinner with my parents and took an insulin injection to counteract the food I was going to eat. My father got off work late so we didn't go to dinner as soon as I thought we would. I was at my parents sitting on the couch when they said I begin acting funny almost drunk which is an indication of diabetic hypoglycemia. I remember standing up telling my parents I wasn't feeling well and then collapsing to the floor. When I first fell to the floor, I was still conscious. I remember lying there looking at the carpet but my eyes weren't blinking. I remember an echo type noise, my parents shaking me, and my dad calling and talking to a 911 operator.

I remember I began to have seizures then I was gone. Everything was very dark but in the center, there was a very bright light. In the center of the light, my niece was dancing around very happily. It was a good feeling and my niece looked very pleased and happy. She looked like she was far away and I remember I felt like I was smiling at how well she was dancing. She was also singing. I felt very emotional and begin to cry. Next thing I remember, I was waking up to a room full of emergency medical technicians and firefighters. They had an IV in me and were giving me sugar water. Later on, I talked to my parents and they said my eyes never closed and I had tears streaming down my face. The experience felt very real and as if I was passing away or being prepared to leave my body.
