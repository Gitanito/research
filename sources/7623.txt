  		              		Experience Description   

    April 10th was my birthday and the 11th was Easter. I was feeling depressed that my family disowned me and my mother said that she wished I was not her son. Normally, I take a shot of heroin a little at a time  so that I can see how strong the dope is and to be able to stop if there is something wrong. For whatever reason, I got to the point that I knew if I did any more, I would die. Yet, I  didn't stop. 

Although this was my third overdose, it was  not my first brush with death. I've been stabbed 5 times,  blown up by IEDs twice while serving in Iraq, and multiple car flips on the highway. I am still here. 

  I heard  the voice of my dead grandmother saying, 'Go home Charlie.' This voice was the only thing I remember and it happened right before I woke up. Apparently, I must have said something because the EMT, a girl I knew from high school, said 'You better not go home Charlie. It took too much to get you back here.' I could see that she was physically drained. It took 10 shots of Narcan and 40 minutes of CPR before I started to breath on my own. My friend who found me, who was also another veteran, said that I had dead eyes, glazed over, no pulse and was not breathing. He did CPR until the EMTs arrived.
