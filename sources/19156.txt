I&#39;m
John Williams I entered the Air Force in
1964 and I was a pilot and had pilot
responsibilities that included training
all Air Force pilots in the VIP and air
medical flying as well as a commander of
a flying unit at Offutt Air Force Base I
also had an engineering electrical
engineering degree background and that
also got me into in the engineering
field and I was in charge of all the
construction projects trying to find the
requirements for new projects for the
military Earth Command in order for them
to be approved by Congress and that is
the extent of quickly of the synopsis of
my back I can discuss Norton Air Force
Base and that as a result of all the
military aerial command bases under me
for their facilities that there was one
facility at Norton Air Force Base that
was close hold not even the the Wing
Commander there could know what was
going on and during that time period
throughout my career it was always
rumored by the pilots that that was a
cover for in fact a location of one UFO
craft and the reason for that location
was folks that could come out landed
Norton play golf be part of a golf
tournament so forth and during that
process could go by the facility and
actually see the UFO I was never allowed
in that area when I was there at Norton
Air Force Base repented during might be
a non career where I was a rescue
helicopter pilot and basically you&#39;re
always together at the club and so forth
and so close hold and many stories
started to come out during a time period
and it was there that I heard several
stories along that line from different
pilots that had also overheard that from
other pilots and you
basically that&#39;s all we was was known
because it was so close home was the
fact that this facility did contain a
UFO and that was about all that could be
said this time period had been in 1969
to 1970 when I heard that rumor first
and validated that you know that the
facility did in fact exist in 1982 time
period you were able to validate that&#39;s
correct because I was responsible for
that base facilities for 1981-82 and
what kind of VIPs would be flown in and
out of there
I it can actually be senators in fact
it&#39;s my understanding that Bob Dole was
at that facility it&#39;s also possible that
back in the early 50s that Eisenhower
actually visited that facility in the
mid-1950s
my father relayed to me the following
and before I get into that I would like
to state who he was in his background
during World War World War two he was
responsible for the entire west coast
for the Signal Corps operation and so he
was familiar with electronics because he
taught that during World War Two in the
beginning and during a dinner party with
a very very close friend a R an employee
was invited and this is located in
Ventura area which was near there and
operation and it impacted my father and
relayed that many times to me the fact
that during that party after several
drinks that the government was spending
more money on anti-gravity than any
other project in the history of this
country and therefore he believed at
that time that we had actually
operational anti-gravity systems also
during that dinner party was relayed to
my mother that of the RAND Corporation
that it wouldn&#39;t be uncommon to go down
the hallway and look into the private
offices and see some of the employees
actually sitting on top of their desks
meditating and levitating over their
desks so these were the stories that
certainly impacted them during that
dinner party all I know is that the
dinner party was somewhere in the
mid-1950s
I assume it was between 1955 and 1957
because so many years ago and I&#39;m trying
to relay when this family friend
actually moved to Ventura
and the time period when that amount of
spending would have been going into
projects would have been during that
well i that spending would probably been
started shortly after World War two I
would think that this would be gone
going ever for too many years
why don&#39;t I all I can recall because I
was a very on purpose at the time that
he us obviously relayed that story even
I told her in my face but I don&#39;t know
the name of that person and I don&#39;t know
the level of that employee but a
basically I don&#39;t he was a viable there
random gracious boyfriend that have this
dinner party was one that was very
affluent in the neighborhood she was in
charge of the Republican National Party
for Ventura County and she generally had
fresh Juan people at her party at Luke
Air Force Base Arizona a United States
Air Force instructor had a German
student with him and they were an
arranged down at Gila Bend Arizona which
is southern part of Arizona that they
strayed off the range saw something and
when they returned to the base they were
met and either pilot was never seen
there since and it was speculated that
they saw something very unusual and
therefore they wanted to remove him now
that was a validated by two or three
pilots as a story in Vietnam in the 1962
70 Tigers the prominence or the greater
exposure or greater occurrence of
unidentified flying objects became would
you call the objects became more known
and they actually stopped they would
time they would communicate we have
records from nineteen
