After the sweats, bowel movement, and losing control of my body, I collapsed onto the supermarket corridor. After about ten minutes, I went into shock for about a minute. Up until then, I could see and hear everything around me.  Either my partner or a nurse who had been passing by said, 'We're losing him.' Then everything became relaxed and went dark. I felt myself floating into pitch-blackness, accompanied by an incredible feeling of peace and tranquility. It was the most serene and beautiful experience imaginable. I couldn't see anything in this darkness, yet I could feel an overwhelming peace and serenity. It was an amazingly beautiful experience. I don't know how long this lasted, but I didn't want it to stop. The next thing I recall was a very annoying jab in my right arm.  The paramedics had arrived with adrenaline.
