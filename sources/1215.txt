ANNUAL BUSINESS MEETING.
The Third Annual Business Meeting of the Members of the Society
was held at 14, Dean's Yard, London, S.W., on the 30th of January.
The President, Professor H. Sidgwick, briefly referred to the growth
of the Society during the previous year. He remarked that during
1884 the Society nearly doubled the number of its Members and
Associates. At the close of the year the Society consisted of :-
Membel'll 223
Associates 258
Honorary Members ... 6
Corresponding Membel'll 9
Honorary A880ciBtes ... 21
Vice-Presidents who are not Membel'll or Aasociates 3
Total 520
The President also referred to the Library as numbering nearly 800
volumes. Of these works, 520 are in English, 135 in German, 110 ill
French, and 15 in other languages.
An audited balance-sheet of the receipts and expenditure of the
Society during the year 1884 was placed before the Meeting. In
commenting on it the President said it appeared that, after taking
account of moneys due a.nd owing at the end of the year, there was
still 1\ halance on the right side; in addition to which there was
the Library, the Stock of Proceedings, and the furniture and fittings
belonging to the Society. It was agreed that a valuation of these should
be made during the current year, so that at its close the Society might
know its exact position both as to capital and as to receipts and ex-
penditure.
The six vacancies on the Council, caused by the retirement in
rotation of fi\"e Members, and by the death of llr. Walter H. Browne,
were filled by the election of the following gentlemen :.-
G. P. Bidder, Q.C.
Alexander Calder.
Richard Hodgson.
Rev. W. Stainton MOBes.
C. Lockhart Robertson, M.D.
J. Herbert Stack.
The approval of the Society was obtained to a change in the
relations between the Council and the investigating Committees. In
future, the responsibility for both the facts and the reasonings in
papers published in the Proceedings will rest entirely with their
authors; and the Council, as a body, will refrain from expressing or
implying any opinion on the subjects thus broug~t forward. The
pa.pers will, however, be submitted to a. Committee of Reference before
publication.
