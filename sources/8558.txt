Sample    344   patients that had experienced a near-death as the result of a cardiac episode.

  Methodology    A   longitudinal study that met and interviewed willing patients at as immediately   after the near-death experience as possible (this varied with the health issues   of each patient being slightly different), 2 years after their near-death   experience, and 8 years after their near-death experience.&nbsp; Patients were   administered questionnaires that assessed how their lives had changed as a   result of the near-death experience.&nbsp; This was called the Life-Change   Inventory.&nbsp; They were also classified as to whether their near-death experience   had been superficial (core) or deep by having the patient's rate on a likert   scale how much they remembered about the near-death experience and this denoted   for the researchers how 'deep' the near-death experience was for the experiencer.   These were measured using, 'the Mann-Whitney test for categorical factors and   with Spearman's coefficient of rank correlation for ration-scaled factors (p.   4).'&nbsp; In addition, demographic information was taken from the participants   denoting characteristics like age, religion, education and medical history,   especially focusing on the drugs used to treat them during the episode in which   they had experienced the near-death episode.&nbsp; Taped interviews were also   conducted with the participants.

  Abstract

At the initial   interviews 62 of the 344 patients interviewed said that they had experienced a   near-death experience.&nbsp; Of these patients, only 41 had experienced a deep   near-death experience where they remembered quite a bit about the experience and   were able to relate this to the interviewers.&nbsp; Of those who had the deep   experiences, considerably more of them died at this first report.&nbsp; 21   participants remembered some of the near-death experience and were classified by   the interviewers as 'core' experiencers.&nbsp; 282 participants reported having no   memory of the near-death experience at all.&nbsp; Because these participants had just   had the experience, they were not administered the life change inventory at this   point.&nbsp; It appeared with this group that, 'no medical, pharmacological, or   psychological factor affected the frequency of the experience (p. 6).'&nbsp; Women   appeared to have deeper experiences than men.

At the two year   follow-up mark, 37 subjects participated in the study.&nbsp; All of the patients   retold their near-death experiences almost exactly as before.&nbsp; The life change   inventory indicated that, 'people who had near-death experiences had a   significant increase in belief in the afterlife and decrease in fear of death   compared with people who had not had this experience (p. 8).'    At the   eight year mark for follow-up, 23 patients participated in the study.&nbsp; These   people did not have the recall of the near-death experience that they had   experienced at the two year follow-up but they did still have some memory of the   experience.&nbsp; They no longer had as intense an interest in spiritual things as   they had at the two year point.&nbsp; They were described however as, 'more   emotionally vulnerable and empathic, and often there was evidence of increased   intuitive feelings (p. 9).'&nbsp; They still had no fear of the afterlife or death.&nbsp;   They had also made more positive changes in their lives in the arenas of,   'social attitude, religious attitude, attitude to death, and other (p. 9).'

  Important Concepts and Definitions    Near-Death   Experience ' all patients who met the criteria of, 'all patients had been   clinically dead, which we established mainly be electrocardiogram records (p.   3).'&nbsp;

Operationalizations

Qualitative and   quantitative measures were used to identify major trends in the research.&nbsp;   Interviews as well as scales were used to come up with conclusions about the   participant's experiences.    A control   group was established during the study of patients who had experienced clinical   death and were resuscitated in this group but had no near-death experience.

  Major Findings

The life-change   inventory assessed some interesting findings in relation to near-death   experiencers and how they might have changed when fitting into the family.&nbsp; In   assessing social attitude, it was brought out that near death experiencers   showed changed attitudes as far as, 'showing own feelings, acceptance of others,   more loving, empathic, understanding of others and more involvement with the   family (p. 8)'.&nbsp; These scores were even greater at the eight year follow-up of   the near-death experiencers.&nbsp; In addition, it appears that these people became   more spiritually-oriented, had no fear of death, and had more interests in other   things besides themselves.&nbsp; These would also have an effect on the family, but   this effect was not specified.&nbsp; Again, these scores were greater in the eight   year follow-up than in the two year.    How these   changes affected the family overall was not available in this report but just   that the people who experienced near-death were more involved with the family is   significant.&nbsp; Due to their experiences in the afterlife, they felt more   compelled to be a part of their family.&nbsp; This effect proved to be lasting over   time as well as immediate right after the near-death experience. </body>
