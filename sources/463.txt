87 5914 1 As for Beer and Ale, which is the Eng .
97. 58/4 lifhman's all, and daily menftruum for the
C17 5714 3 digeltion of his aliments, if it be moderate
1117 564 4 for age and ſtrength , and not uſed in ex
127 554 5 ceſs
, it may agree well enough with tho e
137 544 6 who are accuſtomed to it, and who uſe a
1417 5314 7 proper exerciſe ; but with your crazy-con
1517. 524 8 ititutioned , and ttudious contemplative
167 514 10 people, beer will not come in competition
C17 5014 1 with other liquors. Beſides which we have
1817 4214 12 daily proof how few are the diſeaſes that
1917. 4814 14 mali liquos accords with. It con'ains in
2017 464 s it a much greater quantity of air than any
2017 454 16 other Auid , as has been demonſtrated by
227 444 18 the air pump ; and this is ſtill further
237 424 19 confirmed by thoſe who freely indulge
C17 414 21 themſelves in theſe liquors: for whence
12517 3914 22 comes monſtrous bulkyneſs, bloated fat,
267384 24 rheumatiſms, flatulent cholics, and fre
12717 364 26 quent windy evacuations. Moſtly, I ſay,
2817 344 27 from the too great drinking of beer
2917 334 29 or ale : as for brandy and gni, and fach
3017 314 30 liquors as come under that clair, all which

26. 325 28 cuſtom , very few of its votariesever quit its
36 3015 30 company, till it has left them like Moloch's
46 2815 32 facrifices, viz . burnt up. The next thing
516 2615 34. I ſhall diſcourſe on is tea, which is become
66 245 36 fo univerſal in the ladies books, and others
C6 225 38 of late : it is a liquor ſcarce ſo much as
816 2015 401 dreamt of by our forefathers, and is pro
96 185 42 duced from a ſhrub growing in China and
106 .165 44 Japan, the infufion of which I may not
116 1415 46 improperly call the innocent or honeft
126 125 48 liquor, becauſe it rarely here occaſions the
136 105 50 contrary effe&ts, as may too often be ſaid
C16 85 521 of ſomeother liquors. As for tea I may
156 616
15 541 truly affirm it cannot well be too much
166 415 56 eſteemed, eſpecially by your tender, fine
215 58 conftitutioned , valetudinarians and ftu
186 016 dents : in ſome points it may not correſ
195 586 2 pond with ſhepherds
, ſhip.carpenters; or
205 5616 41 ſuch like robuft or laborious people. Some
CS 546 6 of the falubrious qualities of this liquor,be
225 526 8 it known, are as follow :
-it takesoff the
235 506 10bad effe&ts of a drinking -bout, corrects
245 486 . 12 acrimonious humours, and ſomuſt be good
2515 466 14 for the ſcurvy and gouty complaints; it
265 446 16 vaſtly helps the light, and trengthens the
275 426 181 memory, prevents theſtone, cools the fever,
cs 406 20 alifts the digeftion , and affords a very
1295 396 21 agreeable ſenſation to the ſtomach. How

65 23 By the way ſee your tea be good,
715 216 39 not adulterated, and the green is uſually
8 5 ' 19 41 to be preferred ; but your

125 49 have ever been found great preſervatives of

145 76 53 perance : for the wiſe author of Nature
155 56 55 made nothing in the univerſe to lie ſtill

7/3 488 12 waſtes, dries, wearies, and overthrows' the

93 468 14 may judge of it from what has been wrote
103 468 14 on the other head ; but above all, avoid ex.
113 458 15 ceſſive reſt, which is idleneſs, which opens
123 458 15 a door to numberleſs infirmities, as that
C3 448 16 prince of phyſicians (Galen) has noted ; it
143 448 16 lofes time , dulls the mind, nouriſhes hu

73 438 17 void of exerciſe, ſeldom abounds in ho

1913 438 17 attention is ſleeping and watching; when
438 17 we are tired with exerciſe, we require reſt
438 17 and ſleep. I would have offered ſome
433 17 præcognitas touching the phænomena of
2313 438 17 İleep ; but theſe ſheets will only allow me
2413 438 17 to give a bare definition. Sleep then is
253 16 interruption or ceſſation of our bodily or
613 44 8 16 gans from action , and our minds from
C3 4418 16 real true thinking. The means by which

64 28 32 ill fumes, or newly plaſtered, or wide

Moon, and deprive her of a borrowed light ; they happen is
the following order :
The firſt is an Eclipſe of the Sun , on Thurſday, the 14th of
March, near 5 o'clock in the morning ; therefore inviſible, as
it happens ſo long before the Sun is riſen ; but had it been
later, it could not have been viſible here, for the Moon's true
latitude

latitude is ſouth, and her parallax will make it more ſo, on which
account, it will not be viſible in any of theſe northern parts of
the globe; but in the remote ſouthern parts, it will be a very
great Eclipſe, even ſo as to be both total and central.
The ſecond of theſe Eclipſes is a partial one of the Moon ,
and inviſible, upon Friday the 19th of March. The middle
of this Eclipſe, with reſpect to London , ourmetropolis, happens
about 11 o'clock in the morning. This Eclipſe will be viſi
ble in New Zealand, Van Dieman's Land, New Holland, and
its eaſtern coal, called New South Wales, where Botany Bay
and Port Jackſon are ſituated ; it will be viſible in the Molucca
Ilands, thoſe of Sunda, Sumatra , Bornea, and Philippina; the
kingdom of Siam and China in the Eaſt Indies, and quite
throughout the Eaſtern Tartary, in Japan, and Yedſo. The
Moon will appear a little more than 5 digits eclipſed on her
north ſide.
The third is an Eclipfe of the Sun, on Saturday the 28th of
Auguſt, in the morning, and if the air prove clear, will be vifi
ble with us from funriſe to the End of the Eclipſe ; the Begin
ning cannot be ſeen here, as that happens before theSun riſes,
and the Middle or greateſt Obſcuration is at 19 min. paſt 5
o'clock, when the sun will appear about 5 Digits eclipfed ; the
End ofthe Eclipſe will be at 13 min. paſt 6 o'clock ,apparent
time, for the Meridian and Latitude of London . The Sun will
rife that morning eclipſed at 5 min . paft 5, very near the
Middle of the Eclipſe, at London, andparts adjacent

The fourth and laft of theſe Eclipſes, is a partial one of the
Moon , and if the air be clear, will be viſible with us ; it hap

Middle of this Eclipſe, the Moon will be vertical on the eaſtern
boundary of Congo, in Africa ; therefore will be viſible to the

A Kind of ANSWER to the ENIGMAS, CHARADES,
and REBUSSES, by Way of a WISH.
By Mr. Richard EDMOND, of Fimber, Yorkſhire.
I took Seaſon's Riddles one day in my hand,
I peruſed each Line with muih care ;
But ſometh'ng there was which put me to a ſtand ,
' Til I found what was brought from afar.
I wiſh my friend Kemp had both courage and ſkill,
To catch all the Rat's in this land ;
And wi'h them Mr. Waring his Oven would fill,
And ſo roait them all at command .
They are S 17age vermin, although they are ſmall,,
As any that's under the ſun ;
And if A full Conqueſt was made of them all,
I ſhould thick that great ſervice was done.
If they will proceed, and deſtroy the whole breed ,
Without either lot or controul,
Their good Fortune I'll praiſe, to the end of my days,
And drinks their good health in a Bowl.

Queries anſwered .
An ANSWER to the QUERY, addreſſed to Mr. John COL 28,
of Weedon, by Wafton .
By Mr. John Savage , Green's Norton.
The ark's true dimenſions, as true as I'm able,
And conciſe as poſſible, down . I will table ;
Learn's Cumberland ſays, 'cording to the Hebrew ,
A cubit is inchis juſt twenty and two,
Hence the lingth is five hundred and forty-ſer'n feet,
The breadth ninety -one, and two inches complete ;
The height fifty - four, ard eight in hes likewiſe,
Each room eighteen feet high, if equal in fize.
1
An ANSWER to the QUERY, by Mr. David Lew 19.
According to the Lord Biſhop of Peterborough's Scripture
Tables, a cubit is 21,888 inches ; the Ark was in length
300 of theſe cubits, equal to 547 feet 2,4 inches ; the breadth
was 50 cubits, equal to 91 feet 2,4 inches; the height was
30 cubits, equal to 54 feet 8,64 inches. Theſe three num
bers multiplied together, gives 2730781,9008 cubic feet; but
as the Ark is ſuppoſed to have a roof, riſing like the deck
of a ſhip, of a cubit high in the middle, there muſt be added
to the above 24952,32 feet, the ſolid content of the roof,
which makes a total of 2755734,2208 folid feet in the Ark.
To find its tonnage, a cubit foot of wate weighs 62,5 pounds,
avrirdupois, by this divide 2240 the pounds in a ton, and it
will give 35,84 feet; by which we find the Ark was 76889,9
Dr. Arbuthnot makes it 4172,1 tuns more than the
tons.

NEW ENIGMAS , & c. for the Year 1802.
FIRST ENIGMA, by Mr. BENJAMIN KÆMP, of Farnspeld.
A haggard pair of uncouth birth ,
By blows ſevere firſt brought me forth .
I, offspring of the conteft ,fell,
Caught in a black and diſmal cell;
From thence ſet frec, by curious art,
I now begin to act my part,
While Phoenix like I am ſupply'd,
From where my anceſtors have dy'd .
Am deem'd an univerſal friend,
And on all parties do attend.
Yet to reſtrain my wonted rage,
I'm pent, like Mars, in Vulcan's cage ;
For ſhould I once my freedom gaia ,
'Tis hard my fury to reſtrain.
My pronecareeradmits no bounds,
But deals deſtruction, death , and wounds.
Until at length a deadly foe,
To me oppos’d, my rage lays low.
Conquered, I faint, grow weak and die ;
Ingenuous bards ſay what am I.
SECOND ENIGMA, by Mr. JOHN COLES,
Yefons of enigmatic fame,
Who ſtrangemyft'ries can tell ;
Attend, while I deſcribe my name,
And myſelf to you reveal.
When I hold my gentle peaceful reign,
What blooming ſweets abound ;
What verdure decks each grove and plain,
And beauty clothes the ground.

In tuneful accents ſing,
And proclaim their gratitude and love,
To Nature's boundleſs king.
In the earth ſometimes you may me ſee,
To which the flocks and herds retreat,
With pleaſure , joy, and extacy,
To allay their thirſt and parching heat.
In glitt'ring chariots I may be found,
In which the great and noble ride ;
And traverſe the country around ,
With great attendance at their ſide,
In ſome ingenious works of art,
I likewiſe do reſide;
And with wond'rous ſkill act my part,
And all their motions guide.
In the ſeat of war, I too am found,
Where thund'ring cannons roar,
Where ſlaught'red millions ſtrewthe ground,
And plains are ftain'd with crimſon
Thus far, dear gents, to you my name,
In feeble verſe I've fhewn ;
So hope next year, you'll it proclaim ,
And to the world let it be known.

Then we like moſt ſprung from old mother earth.

The FOURTH ENIGMA, by Mr. Thomas Fox, Norton.
Dear ladies, withoit more ado,
I here preſent myſelf to you ;
Not doubting but you will prove kind,
Tho' to the other fex confin'd.
Whether I ſprung from French, or Dutch,
Or Engliſh heads, it means not much :
My qualities are ſo well known,
' T'is almoſt to a proverb grown ;
That men of fortune without me,
Are theught of mean and low degree;
But men with me have fome pretence,
To be eftecm'd of conſequence.
My ſhape is taper, like aruſh ,
Hangs pendent- at the end abruſh :

A graceful ringlet on each ſide,
Whoſe fragrant ſcent perfumes the air,
And captivates the lovely fair.

Northamptonſoire.
The fituation of things at the preſent moment, hath induced
me to write the following Query,with a requeſt for an illuftra
tion on each verſe.
Did Solomon and Iſaiah write the two following verſes from ex
perience or prophecy? Prov.ch.11.v.26 . " Hethat withholdeth
öc corn, the people ſhall curſe him : but a bleſſing Mall be upon
“ the head of him that ſelleth it.” - Again , Iſaiah ch. 5. v. 8.
“ Woe unto them that join houſe to houſe, that lay field to
“ field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in
« the midft of the earth .”
The Author, HENRY SEASON, humbly thaoks all his
Contributors, and begs their Letters may be ſent, as uſual, directed for
him , at Stationers'-Hall, LONDON (Poft paid), by the middle of April at
fartheſt, with Anſwers to whatever they fend; otherwiſe they cannot be
