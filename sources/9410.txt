  		              		Experience Description:   

  					  I was in extreme pain with chest pains when I heard nurse yell at the doctor I was losing blood pressure. I went into tunnel it was black. I was moving at high rate of speed. I couldn't understand what was going on. All of a sudden I didn't care, I felt so peaceful. I saw light at end of tunnel and wondered what that was. It was very small. I thought I can't fit through that hole. That worried me. I finally realized I wasn't in my body. About that time, they zapped me with the defibrillator. I woke up to everybody crying. After surgery the next day, they got me up and made me walk. The first thing I said to my wife and kids was forgive me for what I was.
