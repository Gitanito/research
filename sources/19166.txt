this movie will be wonderful this close
encounters of the fifth kind
consciousness contact in the human
future that&#39;s what we&#39;re gonna call that
Lance is working on because what we
really want to do my objective is to in
a way that does that the masses can
relate to by doing a part of the film on
the science of consciousness and the
experiments that have been done connect
that to interstellar and to the CFI
protocols and then show some of this and
also have man-on-the-street those of you
who are part of teams who or have done
ce-5 and had contact you know can also
be interviewed if you want to be seen by
a lot of people our goal is to have that
be something that raises consciousness
and of an understanding so we reach that
1% so 1% of the people begin to really
understand consciousness meditation and
contact in the human future and begins
to manifest it see it make it real and
at that point our civilization can go
move over go forward hyper jump to a
level one it&#39;ll be a coherent field
propagation that that 1% that was that
75 million people I hope you guys will
help us we&#39;re going to announce probably
in the next month or so a crowdfunding
campaign to make the movie right now
you know we haven&#39;t done that we just
haven&#39;t had time but if you anyone here
who can help fund that we&#39;re gonna to
make this a feature film that will be
renowned and with the production values
we want be fairly expensive but we also
want to get it out properly you know
when they did what the bleep do they
know they spent X amount they spent X
amount on the film and ten times that on
what&#39;s called the marketing and public
relations and getting the word out so we
want this to be much bigger than that
but we&#39;re gonna need a lot of help to do
it because
don&#39;t have a big corporation funding
this and I&#39;m retired from medicine and
so I can&#39;t do it all by myself so I hope
some of you here will help us thank you
for that yeah so I would like to open
this up to two questions a small group
and so the next 30 minutes I&#39;m opening
the floor I don&#39;t want you to give a
speech just ask yo cuz no one can hear
you you&#39;re not miked and there&#39;s no PA
system just articulate a question and so
I can answer it and we&#39;ll share it with
everyone yes sir almost all the
important teleportation zero-point
energy and communication systems are all
crystalline huh quasi crystalline well
they can flux from a crystalline to a
non crystalline basis yes but they&#39;re
they can flux and even in the at Burk
Lawrence Berkeley labs they were doing
things with energy systems that were
various part people don&#39;t know is that
those would then become enlivened and
begin to recruit energy from the
zero-point field so you need to have
materials that can flux and flow and
that&#39;s very important however remember
that the ability to have materials that
that are going to work well is depend on
the level of consciousness of the people
to understand it and when you get to the
very advanced civilizations those
materials are all at the level where
they can interface with consciousness
and thought and very advanced systems
yes sir Oh
and I&#39;m delighted to see how sort of
moved along
I guess one question for you
how do you feel about this and we have
against the limits of your own knowledge
experiences through the years that have
brought you to where you are now all
right right
well there is it&#39;s it&#39;s the articulation
of what we all know so let&#39;s get back to
this there&#39;s your individual capacity to
understand which is varying but the
truth is in consciousness all of us have
written bara pragya we have the book of
all knowledge in us now understanding
and unfolding it it&#39;s a lot I don&#39;t I am
NOT someone who&#39;s very good with for
example mechanical systems or the
physics I understand but theoretically I
couldn&#39;t build you anything in fact my
wife won&#39;t let me touch the computer but
so there&#39;s a great deal most of what
there is to know I would say I don&#39;t
know
however the things you do you can know
in Discovery you should share the other
part of it is that people know more than
they think they know if they go into a
meditative state and begin to have this
experience the part of this that&#39;s
that&#39;s the big unknown to me is it
because there&#39;s no way to predict it is
how humans are going to how this was all
going to play out in other words how do
we get from where we are to this path
without blowing the whole system and
there are probably a billion different
ways that can happen and it&#39;s so complex
it&#39;s a fractal it&#39;s a very super complex
system and every single person that&#39;s
doing anything in this space and even
the ones who aren&#39;t will affect that
outcome however you don&#39;t you know I
think the focus on what we don&#39;t know
that most of what there is to know in
the cosmos we don&#39;t know yet including
the operating systems of the more highly
developed civilization so we just know
sort of the phenomenology and
expressions but the operating systems
not known in fact they&#39;re the
people I know in the intelligence
community and military are still
studying for example the cloaking
mechanism of a craft that was downed in
near Fort Sill Oklahoma that&#39;s being
studied to figure out how that operates
still and as at least of 2012 so I think
that there&#39;s that the details of this
are and the operating systems and the
details of the technologies a huge
amount of discovery so there&#39;s this
massive sort of exploration and
discovery yet to be unfurled within
knowledge of humanity however the the
deep basic knowledge of consciousness
and science and all that the physics of
understanding transdimensional systems
there&#39;s more knowledge about that then
we&#39;re being allowed to even embrace
because it&#39;s been kept secret and the
most brilliant people I know in the
scientific community do not work at a
university there&#39;s certainly not at
Harvard or Stanford they&#39;re in ask if
they&#39;re in a secure communication
information facility or dumb a deep
underground military base working and
they&#39;re incredibly talented but their
work isn&#39;t benefiting humanity so this
is where the whole question of
disclosure and though some of those guys
I sit with them and go wow it&#39;s
unbelievable because I am NOT an
engineer so I think that we have to set
up the foundation in a mass movement in
society so that those people let&#39;s call
them or liberated from the cages of
these dumbs deep underground military
bases but in those even in those those
guys will tell me they don&#39;t really
understand how like some of these things
you&#39;ve seen here they don&#39;t know how
that&#39;s happening you know so there&#39;s
seen it and understanding the
fundamentals of it and then knowing the
specifics of how you&#39;re doing it
technologically and technically that&#39;s
thousands of years
I would suspect of knowledge and
development and exploration certainly I
don&#39;t know about so I&#39;d say most of what
there is to know in the universe I don&#39;t
know but what I do know I do know
I&#39;d only talk about things I know yes no
that&#39;s not true hey I&#39;ve never said that
be it&#39;s not true
see it would never be true so okay so
people hear what they want to hear
they&#39;re the look let me let me just put
it this way
this aspect of consciousness which is
the non-local field look at it as the
hub of life and each of us or spoke
connected to that hub and if there are
seven and a half billion people on this
planet there are seven and a half
billion paths into that hub and
experience I had a friend it was a
medical doctor on our cg5 team in LA she
played the harp and get into a state
where she would get into pure
consciousness and have these amazing
experiences because of the tonality and
her oneness with the tones coming from
the harp so what I&#39;m saying is there
there&#39;s an almost an infinite number of
ways so I have no attachment to whatever
all I&#39;m saying is that there&#39;s a certain
body of knowledge that exists whether it
be in the ancient Vedic teachings or the
ancient shamans and they&#39;re they really
when you study them deeply they&#39;re all
expressing the same thing but in
different ways to different cultures at
different times and and that&#39;s sort of
my understanding of it yes
he asked about ancient Atlantis you know
I mean that&#39;s a good question an
Atlantis there&#39;s of course the
understanding that out here in the
Pacific there was a mu and Lemuria and
the that whole we don&#39;t really know what
level of consciousness it wasn&#39;t at the
point where the difference between the
time we&#39;re moving into this is called a
Yuga or sati Hyuga this era that we&#39;re
moving into versus the era that of the
past and the last four hundred fifty
thousand years or so is that there were
civilizations that came and went that
were advanced this time it&#39;s going to be
the entire globe will become peaceful
interplanetary and enlightened together
so it&#39;s not just one part or one culture
that comes and goes rises and falls the
term that&#39;s been used by I like is that
it&#39;ll be a day not followed by the night
of ignorance it says like the rice
however you know if you go back millions
of years this is my own understanding
pre homo sapien because the humans have
only been on this planet a certain
discrete amount of time there have been
advanced civilizations here that have
come and gone no doubt there was one on
Mars that left and or that biosphere
eventually vanished for reasons that are
speculative but it could have been a
terrible war my point is is that there
is no question that civilizations on
this planet have existed way pre
recorded history now whether or not you
know some call of mythologically
atlantis or mu or what have you I have
no doubt that&#39;s the case because there&#39;s
a man who works well he acts he is under
contract with ITT works for the CIA but
through corporate contracts who the
intelligence community and military
bring him devices that they find deep in
the ocean or in the earth that are
technological that are hundreds of
thousands to millions of years old for
him to figure out what could this the
used for and I mean he&#39;s told me a great
deal of detail about that and so we know
that there have been advanced
civilizations on this planet my
understanding is that Earth which is
about four and a half billion years old
has had life for about seven hundred
million to a billion but for a long time
there had them been civilizations and
even higher intelligent beings for which
we have no record or it&#39;s only a
mythological record so that&#39;s that&#39;s my
understanding yes sir short brief okay
we don&#39;t use alien that someone an alien
is foreign here here&#39;s why I think words
are important words convey consciousness
and we&#39;ve all been programmed alien is
synonymous with foreign so eat he or
extraterrestrial isn&#39;t and so what I&#39;m
trying to do I know it sounds ridiculous
but words that are loaded I try to avoid
and they carry with it other nests
whereas I want to move us into the
awareness of there&#39;s really the vastness
of the universe there&#39;s one people and
we are they okay so there&#39;s nothing
alien about that it&#39;s that that&#39;s
there&#39;s no us versus them anymore if you
understand but the meditation it can be
any meditation technique the refuse I
like the watching the breath Zen
technique that&#39;s very powerful there is
a technique that involves mantra mantra
meditations that we teach that can allow
people very quickly it&#39;s an advanced
technique to settle into quiet
consciousness we had someone with us in
Shasta who was teaching people to Tai
Chi and some other techniques I don&#39;t I
don&#39;t have a
attachment to the vehicle i I think what
we need to be focused on is the goal it
is where we&#39;re headed and that&#39;s into
that quiet state of mind but personally
what I have found to be most powerful is
techniques that allow you to become
centered and calm whatever that is it
can be a mantra it can be your breath it
can be something else were you then in
that quiet meditative state can go into
the unbound it it you can let go of the
your individuality in the relative world
and there are many many many approaches
I mean the this is some scenario the
whirling surfy Sufis had a technique to
do whirling I think that many people
have discovered different techniques and
one thing I will say is that the reason
I&#39;m very one of the problems with humans
is that they mistake the lantern for the
light all right the lantern here be in
the outer form or the person or the kuru
or the teacher or even the avatar for
the light that&#39;s it within and then we
become attached to the lantern next
thing you know we&#39;re having World War 3
over the lantern right you know my god
is better than you got that whole thing
so I think what we need we need to get
to an understanding that this sort of
state of pure quiet consciousness can be
attained through many different
approaches you need to discover which
ones are most appropriate for you and if
it works for you then do it it is
important to have a certain discipline
about I think it&#39;s important to puts
time aside for whatever meditation
approach you use two or three times a
day on a regular basis in a discipline
way and if you have opportunities go on
a retreat where you can do it
intensively you know for a week or two
that&#39;s great to do I mean instead of
going to Las Vegas to the casinos do
something a deep meditation retreat
where you can really collapse the
timeframes because it&#39;s an exponential
growth when you can take time away from
the world just for yourself to sit
quietly do nothing
meditate and explore consciousness
together so that&#39;s what I recommend yes
hey my name is Dan arcturus we run a c5
in a Nevada City Grass Valley area with
my friend Yvonne and so I have a
question about I&#39;ve talked to you before
about fear-based
belief systems so given that not
everybody here is going to be speaking
with anybody in political power or any
of that culture such as the Clintons or
anybody like that what is your method of
approaching these fear-based belief
systems can you give us a reflection so
that we can in a sense well when you
deal with people who are attached to
this sort of a manichaean worldview of
an us-versus-them and black and white i
think that you have to first listen and
see where they&#39;re coming from and if
it&#39;s someone who&#39;s a political figure
military figure intellectual one of the
points I make is take the technologies
we have extrapolate it forward thousands
or millions of years then visualize
those technologies weaponized turn into
weapon systems so that if these
civilizations really were hostile to us
per se it would have been all over in
1945 all right point set match done but
you have to take them through a
technological exposition and sort of you
know it&#39;s disclosed to them there are
technologies that are way beyond nuclear
way beyond even what classified projects
have but if those were wielded by
civilizations that were at a level zero
like we are they would have blown
themselves up long before they got here
and if they were here it would take a
nanosecond to terminate this
civilization it&#39;d be very finished so
that&#39;s just a rational discussion now
here&#39;s where the nuance comes in
it doesn&#39;t mean what I just said doesn&#39;t
mean that these civilizations are
thrilled with what&#39;s happening on this
planet so I make a distinction between
the misadventures of the military and
the intelligence community doing things
that are very dangerous and harmful to
us and to these other civilizations from
there being intrinsically hostile to
humans or earth if they were
intrinsically hostile to humans on earth
and wanting to conquer it or shut it
down it could happen very instantly but
there are these civilizations are not
pleased let me put it this way with with
the current status quo because let&#39;s
step back let&#39;s just step back a little
bit and look through the eyes of a
civilization at level 1 2 3 and above
you have a civilization on earth that
has had the capacity to establish a
peaceful world with zero point and free
energy save the environment eliminate
poverty have justice on this planet for
almost a hundred years we haven&#39;t done
it and instead we&#39;ve gone down this side
path it&#39;s a terminal extinction path of
weaponizing every technology first
massive amounts of secrecy the world
being damaged to old nineteenth-century
fossil fuel and and mid 20th century
atomic nuclear power meanwhile the earth
is dying
I mean we&#39;re killing the biosphere
species so if you were an ET coming from
space and you were to just
dispassionately observe the wars the
destruction the ecosystem damage the
what the weapons putting in space the
targeting of their craft you could be
excused for being a bit dismayed and not
pleased that that doesn&#39;t mean that
they&#39;re hostile to us at per se as a
people or as
world it means that they&#39;re probably
hostile to our hostility and other words
are not happy with and for that reason
there are things that have happened that
have been misinterpreted and spun it&#39;s
just it&#39;s so we&#39;re there where it&#39;s been
spun into some sort of a threat now if
you if you wear rose-colored glasses the
whole world looks pink so if you&#39;re a
military person wear anything out there
that you don&#39;t control that&#39;s in and
around the earth is a threat and you&#39;re
gonna approach it as a threat and try to
develop technologies to kill it then
that&#39;s coming from that level of
consciousness so from that level of
consciousness yes you know but I think
from the from what the objective
dispassionate view is I think these
civilizations are waiting for us to
reach level one their understanding
we&#39;re in this transition period they
want to assist but it can&#39;t do it
overtly I mean if they land it on this
planet and said now you&#39;re at a level
one we&#39;re taking over well that would
not be effective cuz there&#39;s no
evolutionary learned inheritable
consciousness that goes with it and
moreover I mean it&#39;s like us going to
Afghanistan trying to impose
Jeffersonian democracy on warlords this
is a it doesn&#39;t happen that way so there
are these civilizations certainly
understand where we are but they also
this is the beautiful part I&#39;m convinced
they also understand the potential and
the beauty of humanity and the earth
making it through this transition and
the kind of beautiful planet we can have
post phase transition into level one two
three and four so I think they have
they&#39;re taking a very long view in the
meanwhile there are things they have to
do to be careful so I explained to
people you know rather than giving in to
this false dialectic and sort of us
versus them manichaean view black and
white and you know we that&#39;s all coming
from the consciousness of division we
need to come from the consciousness of
the unit of state look at the long view
and also with the heart of compassion
understand the human condition
compassionately but also understand how
these civilizations might be viewing us
both in ways that are positive and
potential but also concern deep
concerned about what&#39;s happening many
people have had contact with these ETS
going back decades there&#39;s a deep sort
of spiritual and eco spiritual message
that comes through those contact
experiences for a reason because there&#39;s
some of the military guys who are in
these ICBM facilities where in crafts
came outside and they were taken offline
it might not North Dakota some of the
disclosure
people had told me Oh captain solace
told me his feeling was that they
weren&#39;t really a threat because
obviously if they were threat they gonna
shut the whole system down they were
trying to say we&#39;re very concerned about
mutual assured destruction and these
weapons that could destroy the whole
biosphere please don&#39;t destroy this
beautiful planet and and that&#39;s what he
felt from that experience now the people
who have wanted to spin it into alien
invasion week at the nuclear silos well
this is just rubbish I mean you know
obviously they could have D materialized
every ICBM we haven&#39;t moved it out they
know that that&#39;s not the way to do it
but at the same time things have
happened from these ETS where they&#39;ve
tried to let us know you need to move
off this course so it&#39;s a gentle nudge
it&#39;s about power not force and power is
different from force there was a book by
this yep genuine power so you have to
understand the consciousness and
understanding of that that kind of
civilization yes ma&#39;am
your pictures and that suddenly do you
think that our friends up there are
transmuting well yeah the inter he&#39;s
asking about various interventions that
have been done to keep the worse from
happening there have been so for example
I think that there are a number of times
that we could have gone to DEFCON 1
which is the defense condition one we
are full nuclear launch where that has
been kind of stopped and things have
happened quite amazingly but so there
clearly see that we&#39;re in trouble and
they&#39;re trying to see that we don&#39;t have
the worst happen and I also my
understanding is that there&#39;s a great
deal of activity with their monitoring
and even documenting the biosphere
damage doing sampling of the bio genome
let&#39;s call it the collective genome of
the planet plants animals organisms much
of the activity has been seen by ET
crafts or taking samples of water
samples of species and what-have-you
because they are strapped elating the
rate of damage way ahead of anything our
supercomputers can and I think that&#39;s
being watched with great concern but
also there may be an element of it where
they&#39;re documenting things so they can
be put back in a worst-case scenario I
don&#39;t want to get too far into this
discussion I call it Plan B in other
words as Tom Bearden said to me once
don&#39;t get me wrong the fools may blow it
yet so I love him from Louisiana but Nia
the fools may blow it yet in which case
there could be a brief overt the
intervention to stabilize the biosphere
and and
have you that&#39;s something that is a very
long discussion I&#39;m very familiar with
it so you you develop different
contingencies
that&#39;s one contingency yeah yes yeah you
know it&#39;s it&#39;s so beautiful because you
know as a doctor a lot of people say oh
why aren&#39;t you focusing on that I said I
go well why not focus on healing systems
that are transmitted I said well those
aren&#39;t gonna be allowed to be used
anymore than a zero-point energy device
is going to run your car to replace the
internal combustion engine until we as a
people come together and decide we&#39;re
going to make this so what I understand
about them from just even classified
systems that exists let me start with
human classified systems is that they
have abilities to take disease states
and trans dimensionally reverse them up
to and including regenerating a severed
spinal column or a limb that is off the
phantom limb and from the from that sort
of if you will subtle energy template of
the astral have it come back and I was
in an underground facility near the
Mexican border some years ago where they
were doing that kind of work so I mean I
don&#39;t you know this stuff I&#39;ve been
exposed to most of it I don&#39;t can&#39;t aqui
there&#39;s no foundation when you talk
about it publicly because it has no
credibility unless I can get the
scientist in that skiff that that base
that talk about it but what I&#39;ve seen if
you&#39;re asking me personally I know that
we have the ability to do a great many
things that would revolutionize medicine
revolutionize healing that are
scientific technologies that are in this
transdimensional interface between
material and the gap the interface
between those subtle energies let&#39;s call
it it&#39;s to be about subtle energy
medicine but I mean on a very scientific
basis technologically people say
wouldn&#39;t that be okay to come out with I
said well it would accept then the
scientists would say well if you&#39;re
doing it for there
why can&#39;t you do it for that and that
that would terminate ExxonMobil and the
petrodollar it&#39;s a part and parcel of
the problem so again we need to get our
act together once we do the civilization
that we&#39;ll have here is beautiful beyond
our wildest dreams this side over here
yes sir can&#39;t hear you
right this may be the reason not to but
that would be like given a supercomputer
to a caveman
so I think what we have to understand is
that from human engineering and
understanding these technologies have
come we have to put a strategy together
I&#39;ve recommended an incubator fund to do
an open source development of these sort
of zero-point technologies that are
stationary
let&#39;s leave the antigravity aside for a
little while because those can be
missile delivery systems and come
forward with an energy generation system
that can replace everything that&#39;s
running the planet right now including
fan jets could be replaced with these
kind of things without it being anti
grab but that that project needs to be
have serious scientific and strategic
support the reason that&#39;s never happened
is that the technology teams have
approached it like a new software
package or a new iPhone or a new Samsung
Galaxy in other words they put the
shrouded in secrecy they cry try to go
to the intellectual property route at
that point it is intercepted two ways
it&#39;s either bought out and black shelved
or if you don&#39;t agree to getting it
bought out black shelved you&#39;re just
flat out killed and those technologies
are taken now there&#39;s a man who was
being groomed and courted by a CIA agent
named CJ key who I knew many years ago
to be part of that effort to work with
the intelligence community and in the
process they let him copy a lot of the
documents and patents related to some of
these devices dating back to the early
part of the 20th century I have that CD
now that CD which has all that on it
would have to have a team of people
begin to put it into from
two-dimensional into three-dimensional
engineering systems and that&#39;s going to
cost something there&#39;s a certain
quantifiable amount to have the security
and
the tactical and the engineering and the
right equipment to do it that&#39;s not
going to happen with a few hundred
thousand dollars to co-op can you know
the the analyzer in electronic systems
themselves each bench stations probably
five hundred thousand just to do the
right frequency work if you&#39;re going to
do it carefully and not kill yourself or
kill someone else or shut down the radio
frequencies and you know there&#39;s no FM
or AM radio reception in the city I mean
there are a lot of weird effects of this
I won&#39;t go into what I&#39;m saying is that
to do it properly you need to have
people know what they&#39;re doing and what
I&#39;ve been asking is that is that the
either the public or and or the some
high-net-worth people come together and
put a incubator fund to get together to
make that happen but with the knowledge
that it&#39;s gonna be open source like
github it all has to be open sourced it
has to be live streamed each
breakthrough in the technological
development needs to be put into the
public domain and you need an education
and PR system in place so at each point
of development there are at least you
know somewhere in the neighborhood of
ten million to a billion people who know
about it because if they don&#39;t know
about it it becomes the tree that falls
in the forest that no one knows about so
there is a strategy for doing this we&#39;ve
developed it very carefully I have a
strategic plan and a summary if anybody
wants to fund that give me a call if
anyone has an existing technology that
is legit let me know it has to be
independently reproducible it has to be
able to run itself it has to be able to
be reproduced only from plans by some
engineering teams I have in place on
standby ready to go and then you have to
agree that we will dump that knowledge
into the internet and into every media
massively instantly as soon as it&#39;s
confirmed it will not be kept secret it
will not be go the patent route and if
it so that&#39;s
I might also add that if it&#39;s a
legitimate existing technology there are
people I&#39;m associated with who they
don&#39;t want to get involved until
something exists but they don&#39;t want to
put the funds in until something does
exist but when something does exist and
they&#39;ll do it so somebody need to be
bought out let&#39;s say you had someone who
is a engineering team that had a system
like this they&#39;ve spent their life&#39;s
work that I have people now who could
make them happy so that they could be
involved and get financially compensated
but my goal is to get it out to the
world open source with no restrictions
because as soon as you go that route
you&#39;ve given enough to there those are
speed bumps you hit and by that time is
your enemy once you have a system that
is operational if you go that route it
will either be seized or the team will
be killed you know it&#39;s like the people
got all Stan Myers equipment that&#39;s what
happened to them they&#39;re all
assassinated and shut down yeah because
I was there trying to get that and they
went to people had more money those
people then got threatened and the chief
funder called me up hysterically and
scared and I wrote out a three page
strategic plan I just outlined in the
last five minutes that they needed to do
but they wouldn&#39;t do it they wanted to
hold on it&#39;s like hold on to my precious
ring my precious my precious and my
golden ring well it takes you down to
the bottom of the Marianas Trench I mean
you you cannot hold on the technology
has to be put out and it has to be put
out in a way that is effective and is
reached by millions of people and you
cannot put that toothpaste back in the
tube you&#39;ve squeezed it hard bang it&#39;s
out the reason for that is the system is
set up to intercept shut down those
systems inventors technologies people
any system that is actually a legitimate
let&#39;s call it overunity system where
it&#39;s putting out more energy you have to
supply self-running
it can be mechanical solid-state those
are going to get intercepted for
heaven&#39;s sakes there was a very advanced
battery that I know
Tesla wanted that you could have run a
instead of 900 pounds of lithium-ion
I&#39;ve been a hundred pound battery that
go 500 miles like a charge in 15 minutes
and a big oil conglomerate bought that
technology out black shelved it so
that&#39;s why your Tesla will go a couple
hundred miles takes 12 hours to charge
and hundreds of pounds of these
lithium-ion batteries it&#39;s not about
what is technically possible
it&#39;s what&#39;s strategically and this is
what I say this to technology people
that you have to know the lay of the
land it&#39;s not a conspiracy theory it&#39;s
the fact that there are interest groups
that have enormous things at stake
financially and otherwise who do not
want this out they don&#39;t want the
knowledge out they certainly don&#39;t want
the technology out so if we&#39;re gonna
make this change happen you have to do
it eyes wide open understanding what
you&#39;re facing and it&#39;s taken me 28 years
to kind of wrap my mind around that and
sort of say this is a strategy that&#39;ll
work because I&#39;ve been involved with
people in the new energy fields since
1991 and every other strategy has failed
which is why you&#39;re still running a car
with fuel in it I think that&#39;s why we
have to learn from history and not
reproduce it and we have to have a
different consciousness and strategy
around this sort of technological
development and again I recommend of
what I call a phase 1 technology the
phase 1 technology would be stationary
energy generation systems or run your
home your car stationary and fixed in a
car but not anti-gravity
transdimensional systems those systems
are need to be phase 2 3 4 yeah so I
guess getting a little past time I&#39;ll
take one more question yes sir
the streams and the clouds that he&#39;s
asked about chemtrails my short answer
is on the scale of one to two I mean one
to ten and my concerns or what I&#39;m
dealing with
it&#39;s - - it&#39;s it most things or
contrails are seen the ones that are
chemtrails we know why they&#39;re being put
up there it&#39;s the left hand who can&#39;t
control the right hand putting
reflective aluminum and other particles
up to reflect sunlight cuz we&#39;re losing
our polar icecaps
and it&#39;s the short answer is it&#39;s a
stupid band-aid on a dam that&#39;s breaking
alright and but I&#39;m trying to deal with
the whole dam breaking that&#39;s what we
all need to be concerned with so I would
say that&#39;s why I say on an order of U 1
to 10 it&#39;s a -2 in terms of what my
concern would be thank you all very much
for coming I really think
