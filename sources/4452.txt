Behold the early Year Mischief prepares,
Mars to Sol, Venus to Chronus squares;
Hence Discords come, aad hence Divisions flow,
Hence Libels, lying Ne*s, and Traytors too.
I wish their Rage might ceae, and that my Pen
Could Peace proclaim to Mortals once again.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE
ECLIPSES of the SUN and MOON,
And other Appearances in the Heavens,
In the YeAt 1809.
1
Calculated from new and improved Solar
and Lunar Tables.
Founded on the Newtonian Syjlem of Gravitation
,
And agreeing with Obfervations to a Airprifing Exaclnefr.
THE two great Lamps of Heaven will this Year afford
four Eclipfes, namely, each Luminary two. Thefc
will happen in the following Order:—
,
The firft is a central and annular Eclipfe of the Sun,
upon Friday the 14th of April, in the Evening, with re-
fpecl to us, but fo late as to be invifible ; for the Ecliptical
Conjunction ha.nens at 57 min. paft 7 o'Clock. This
Eclipfe is central on the Meridian, at 36 min. pal our
8 o'Clock, in Latitude 74 deg. North, and 128 deg.
53 min. Welt from Louden ; which Place falls in the Icy
Sea, within the Arctic Circle. —This Eclipfe will be feen
in Hud/on*s Bay, in North America, and on the Eaftern
Coali of AJla\ and along the Track of central Appearance
and Parts adjacent, inftead of an aftonifhing gloomy Dark-
nefs, the Spectators will be entertained with a fplendid
Annulus, or Ring of Light, encompaffing, the Moon's dark
Body on every Side. —The iecond Eclipfe of this Year is
©f the lefTer Light the Moon; the Defect happens in the
9th deg. of Scorpio, upon Saturday the 29th of April, at
N<ght, and vifible here if Clouds interpofe not.—At the
Beginning of this Eclipfe, the Moon will be vertical or
directly over head, in 13 deg. 49 min. of South Latitude,
and in. 12 deg. 53 min. Eaft Longitude from London
;
which Place falls on the Weftern Coaft of the Kingdom of
Benguela in Africa, the Climate of whjch is very perni-
cious to Europeans. At the Middle of this Eclipfe the
Moon *ill be vertical in 14 deg. 2 min. South Latitude,
and in 8 deg. 45 min. Weft Longitude from London,
wtieh Place falls a little to the North Weft of the Illand of
Hcknay in the Atlantic Ocean, which 1 Hand belongs to
from Londoriy which Place falls near the Eaftern Coaft of
South America, near to the Brazils. From all which it
appear?, that the Beginnine of mis lunar EcHpfe will be
vifible in the Bay of Bengal, and 10 all the !fl ;nds in the
Indian Sea; but the Moon will fet eclipied in the aforefaid
Bay, before the Time of greateft Objuration, and alfo
abcut that Time in the Ifland of Ceylon.-—Soon after the
Beginning the Moon will rife in the Ifland of Jamaica, and
alfo at the Ifland of Hifpaniola, in the IVeft
Indies. —Hence
it alfo appears, that this Eciipfe will be vifible to all South
America, a fmall Part of the Eallern Coall excepted ; to all
Africa, and the Ifland of Madagafcar,—The Beginning of
this Eciipfe will not be vifible in North America, except at
the Ifland of Newfoundland, bat the Moon rites eciipfe^,
more or Jefs, in ail thofe Part*. The whole of this Eciipfe*
will be vifible to all the Caribbee Iflands in the Weft Indies^
and alio to the Ifland called Sandwich La?td, and the Ifland
called (he Southern Georgia, fituated in the great Southern
Pacific Ocean ; one of thefe J Hands was discovered by
Capt* Carteret, in 1767, and the other by Capt. Cook,
in 1775. In this Ifland of Great Britain it may be ex-
pected to happen according to the following Type and
Calculation:

—H. O. an Horizontal Line.
The third Eclipfe, is another of the Sun, upon Mcnday
the Qth of Oiiober, at 4^ min. pad our 7 in the Morning :
But by Reafon of ihc Moon's South Latitude, tiiis Ecfipfe
is invifible to u?, notwithfianding iis falling in the Day
Time; and not 10 us only, but 10 all Europe. ~— In the
remote Southern Parts of the World this will be a very
great Eclipfe, for at 17 min. paft our 8 o'Clock the Sun
will be centrally eclipfed on the Meridian, in Longitude
55 deg. 45 min. Eaft from London, and in Latitude 61 deg.
40 min. South, which Place falls in the Great South Sea,
among iinn Fields and iQands of Ice, but whether this
Eclipfe will prove total, I cannot pofuively fay, for by my
Calculations the Diameters of the Sun and Moon are very
nearly equal, fo that a fmali Error, either Way, will make
it either total or annular, but without Continuance. —I ex-
peel this Ec'ipfe will be feen in Ntw Noiltwd.
The fourth and laft ts a lunar D.-fecl, upon Movday the
23d of Gflober, in the Morning, invifible to us in England,
as the Eclipfe will not begin un;ii 41 min. pail 7, under
the Meridian of London. — At the Beginning of this Eciipfs
the Moon will be vertical in 10 deg 36 min. North,
Latitude, and 1 1 1 deg. 54 Min. Weft or IcnJon, which
Place falls in the Grfeat South Sea or Pacific Ocean, a little
to the Weft of t e Coaft of Mixico, or New Spain, in North
America The Beginning of this Eclipfe wiii be feen at
the Jzores or Weftern IJIands, and alfo at Cape Ferd ljlands,
and even, i ex peel, 01 the Weftern Coaft of Ireland. —
At the Time of the greateft Objuration (which will be
10 Digits on the Moony
% Nomh Limb) the Moon is vertical
or direct!; over Head at Midnight, in 10 rfeg. 50 min.
North Latitude, and in Longitude 134 deg. 35 mm. Weft
from
ECLIPSES, &c. 39
from London, which Place falls in the fame Great Pacific
Ocean ; and at this Time the Moon fets eclipfed at Cape
Horn, and on the Eaflern Coaft of South America; but the
Moon rifes eclipfed on the Coafl of New Holland, called
New South Wales, a little Time before the greateft Ob-
scuration. — At the End of this Eclipfe the Mton will be
vertical in 1 1 deg. 4. min^of North Latitude, and 157 deg.
15 min. Weft Longitude from London, which Place faHs
in the fame Great Pacific Ocean, near upon the Track of
Lord Anfon, in his Voyage round the World.
This Eclipfe will be vifible from the Beginning to the
End, at ihe Society 3nd Frienaly I/lands; but the Moon will
rife eclipfed at the New Hebrides, New Caledonia, and
New Zealand, and alfo o*n the Ifland 0$ Japan, and on the
Eaitern Coaft of Afia ; the End will alfo extend itfelf to
the Philippine ljlands, and the Ifland of Borneo, in the
Indian Ocean, formerly thought tj be the largeit Ifland in
the World ; but the largeft in the World is now found to
be New Holland, in the great South Sea.
Other Jppearances in the Heavens.
For the Sake of the Curious, that have proper Tele-
fcopes, I give the following Oceultations of the fixed Stars
by the Moon, that will be vifible to us in an Evening; as
computed from correct Agronomical Tables, for the Me-
ridian and Latitude of London, according to a pp. Time*
1. On Monday, Feb. the 27th, in the Evening, the Moon
eefcipfes 1 Alpha Cancri, a Suit of the 4th Magnitude.—The
Moon's Eaflern Limb' will take the Star at 5 min. paft 8
o'Clock ; and the Moon's Weftern Limb will leave the faid
Star at 15 min. pad 9 ; after the Star has been hid 1 Hour
and 10 Min. The Star will appear to the North of the
Moony
s Centre.
2. On Saturday, March the 4th, the Moon eclipfes a
notable Star of the firit Magnitude, called the Virgin's
Spike, or Spica Firginis, This will make a pretty Appear-
ance through a Telefcope, mould the Air prove favourable;
for the Star will immerge behind the Eaastn Edge of the
Moon* at 20 min. paft 10 o'clock at Night ; and wiH again
emerge horn behind the Welkin Edge of the tifso>n at 45
miti.
4® MOORE, 1809.
rnin. paft iz; after being hid by the Moon 25 minutes.
Note.—The Meon's lower Limb will take and leave the
Star.
3. Sunday* May the 28th, the Moon will eclipfe a fmall
Star in Scorpio, of the 4th Magnitude. —Immerfion at 45
m?n. pad 10 at Night, and the Emerfton will be at 54 rain,
paft 11 o'ClocIc.
4. On Tburfday, September the 28th, the Moon will
edipfe two fmall Stars in Taurus, namely, 1 Delia, and
2 Delta ; they are of the 4th Magnitude.—The Moon's
Limb takes the firft of thefe Stars at33 min. paft 8 at Night,
and that of theiccond at 52 min. pail 8 ; and the firft Star
will appear again from behind the Mom, at 9 min# paft 9
;
anxi the fecond Star comes out at 48 min. paft 9 o'Clock.—
The fir ft of thefe Stars pafFes more North of the Moon'%
Centre than the fecond will.
5. On Tuefday, December the 19th, the Moon again
eclipfes the fame two Stars in Taurus % the Immerfion ©f
the firft Star will be at 10 min. paft 5 o'Clock in the Even-
Jng ; and the Immerfion of the fecond Star will be at 41
min. paft 5 ; and the Emerfion of the firft Star will be at
X 1 min. paft 6, and the Emerfion of the fecond will be at
47 min. paft 6 o'Clock. The firft of thefe Stars pafTea
North of the Moony
z Centre, anti the fecond will pafs to
the So*th of the Moots** Centre.
Upon the Com rt that appeared in the Autumn of the Year
1807, vulgarly called a Blazing Star.
THIS Comet made its firft Appearance (or at leaft w:as
noticed) towards the End of September, after it had
paft its Pentium, and was returning from the Sun. It
performed its apparent Courfe through the Conftellations
0/ the Serpent, Hercules, &c. The laft Time I faw ihks
Comet was on the 6th of December, at 7 in the Evening (as
my Obfervations of it were often interrupted by cloudy
"Weather) when it was, I found, advanced far above the
bright Star in the Harp, and near to the fm3li Star in
the Bill of Cygpits, or the Swat*; the Comet then appeared
very fmall, io that I could not fee its Tail, evenjvith a
good two -feet AUromatic Telefcope, Now, Comets

appear ouly during lhat little Part of tHeir Courfe which
they dcfcribe in the Neighbourhood of the Earth,
the reft is performed in the mod diilant" Regions of the
Heavens, during which Time they are loft to us ; and when
a Comet returns, we c?n have no Knowledge of it but from
fcarching anterior Records of Comets which have appeared
before, and comparing their Elements together. It dees
not appear that the Elements of this Comet will tally with
any on Record, and was not expecled, but came and burft
upon us -quite unknown ; and, indeed, after all that has
been faid and done by learned Men, to determine the
Nature cf Comets and their Tails, our Acquaintance with/
r b°m is ftill very limited. —Many of the Operations of
Nature are earned on in her great Laboratory which we
cannot comprehend ; hut now ^nd then we fee fome-of the
Tools with which ihe is at Work, There is a Myftery in
the Deftination of Comets^ which feerus fo place them in the
allegorical View of 'Fools, probably c figned for fom*fa!u-
tsry Purpofes to be wrought by them. It may be that the
Vapour which corVpofes the Tail cf a Comet t by being
perpetually rarefied and dilated, may at lall bediilioated and
fcaaercd through the whole Heavens ; and, by little and
little be attracted towards the Planets by its Gravity,
and mixed with 'their Atmcfpheres, and contribute ta
fupply the Waftes cf planetary Fluids, fpent upon Ve-
getation and Putre/aclion ; and it is, perhaps, chiefly
from Comets \ *hat we have the moli fubtle and ufeful
Pan of our Air, fo ntceffrry to preferve the Life of
all Things with us. I now give the curious Readers the
Elements of the Orbit of the Comet of 1S07, from Ob-
fervation. Mean Time of the Perihelium adapted to the.

TTAVING of lace Years fpcken much in my Almanacks
JlA of tKe Alteration of the Weather from the Pofaions
of the Planets, ani their Influences on the Air or Atmos-
phere ; but in an Ifland like oars fo fabject to a Variety of
Alterations in the Winds, (on which the Wea/ntr in this
Country Co much defends) fuch Fore-know ledge, with
Certainty, at all Times, cannot be expected ;
yet, never,
lefs, i (liaii, from Year w Year, endeavour to give che
beii Judgment I can; as a! Co towards peffe&iag the Theo-
ry of the BAROMfirBrt or Vj/ eat her Glass, wiiich [
have made my Study and Care for more than forty Ytars (
My Readers will Bail, I have as ufaai, on tae Right*
hand Pages, under the Depth of Rain fallen at London,
given the Time to a Day or Two, whan there is a proba-
bility of Snow or Rain, (more or lefs in Quantity)
within the Trio* a urn or Cuinpils bl Three Diy.c
, deduced
from AftrofogicaJ Rules and Philofophical Principles, as
is alfo the Weather given in the Columns, on the Left-
hand Pa^es of each Month. Thefe Oofervations of mine
concerning the Weather, are to be 'claa*<;d with a good
Weather GLfs, vfhich is an instrument by which we. can
fee the Variations in the Gravity or Weight of the Air
;
from whence we judge what Changes in the Weather are
likely to take Place. There i&one O jfervation to be n u:ced,
whicn perhaps all are not fufSciently acquainted with, and
that is, the ihifthig of the Winds; far in this Country, the
greateit Height of the Mercury in the Tune is inoilly
found upon an £ iiter!yor N urtlv Bauerly Wind ; and very
often, when the Wind blows from thence, or is about
Ihiftipg into thefe Quarters, we may have Snozv or Rain %
notwithstanding the Q^tcttfilver may Itand pretty high in
the Tube, and even be in a fifing State. This I advife

Courteous Reader, »
GOD's Judgments are iliil abroad in the Earth ; I wifti
the People of all Nations and Countries would take
Warning thereby, andleara Righteoufnefa, Britain groans
under the PrelTure of heavy Taxes, and other Burthens,
heretofore unknown; her Manufacturers are thrown out of
£mploy, and her Commerce greatly crippled ; jet, alas
!
Britain continues in her Sins. If we turn our Eyes around,
we behold Kingdoms fhakew to their very Foundations, and
Kings and Potentates tumbled from their Thrones. Gtr-
many has been ranfacked, and her Hofts fubdued ; Prujfia,
Spain, and Portugal, humbled in the Dulh Holland re-
duced, as well as fome other Countries, to the rnoft abjeel
Shvery ; and rightful Sovereigns, of various Kingdoms,
depofed. Let Britain nor provoke the overwhelming
Blow, by outwearing the GooSbch and Mercy of Omni-
potence. A fplendid Comet made its Appearance lall Au-
tumn ; the Apparition of Comets in an Aftrological Senfe,
contains the Fate of all People fubjed to their Circle and ,
Motion. The Fate of the different Countries (at this Time
of my Writing) are not yet finifhed ; true it i?, that ia
fome Countries it is begun, and a Foundation laid for act-
ing greater Matters, when Time and Opportunity offer; trte
Sword, t fear, hath not yet dene its Part ib fufiicicntly as
it muft do. It is juil Forty Years fince a former fplendid
Comet appeared, when a P'erfon was then born in the
Jiland of Coriica, who had this Comet in the Tenth Houfe
or his Nativity ; and if we obferve the Portion of the Hea-
vens at his Birth, in Relation thereto, we (hail find, That
that Man would act his Pate upon the Stage of Europe
with fo much Succefs, that it would not be in the Power
of any Prince, King, or Na.ior, to refill him errceluaHy ;
yet, I fay, he will not die Aged ; he has yet got to con»
elude, and finifh that Dance he has be^un.

feems that the Face of Affairs is very hufti and private

mer of Expeditions, War, and Bloedfhed, ftrange Oc-
currences are on the Anvil of State ; for the Powers of
Europe are flill much divided among tbemfeives, fo ihat
each Power is feeking its own Intcreft, rather than the
Common Good : and this hrs been the Cafe with the Nor-
thern Powers, through French l> fluence, Power, and

Peace be not fpredrly fet cn Foot (and it might have

This Quarter commences on Monday the 20 h Day of
March, at 14 min. pall Twelve at Nighr ; at which Time
the Pofitions of the Planets are exhibited in tne above
Scheme ; where the 4th Degree of *cr calminaces, and the
6th Degree of f afcends ; the Moon has juft paft a 6 of

the Cufp of the Afcendant. Jn th?s vernal Figure I fVd
the Planet Mars, though pofited in the loth* is in his De-
triment ; and the Planet Saturn entering into the Sign
Sagitarius ; thefe, with the other Configurations, fhew
that forne great Changes are ftill approaching various
States and Kingdoms, and amongft the reft, the Spanijh
and Portuguefe Nations, thoff great Props and Supporters
of papal Power and Superftition. The Powers of Italy, &c.
are in the grcateil Diilrefs, and they all will find none that
can erTedually relieve them. Thc.different Powers in the
North, and in Germany, are in the fame Situation. As to
the United States of America, they mull take Care of
French Counfels, and French Politics. During the Years
1807 and 1808, firft one Power and then another Power,
made Peace with France, as I had forne Expectations they
would, from the Face of the Heavens, and as J hinted in
my Almanacks; but Britain, unhappy Brit ai'ft, kept be-
hind, anti continued the wide wafting War ! Now, if the
Foundation /or a genera! Peace has not been laid, or be-
gan before this Time, or near this Time, I am of Opi-
nion this is not the Year when Peace (hall wave her Olive
Branch over the whole World. Indeed^ there will be
Difcords, Bloodfhed, and Revolutions in the North of
Europe, as well as other Places; bur there is a Hand unfeen,
which brings Good out of EvH; and private Calamities
fhaH at laft produce a public Good. The Almighty
works by Ways infcrutable to Men. The French Govern-
ment is Mill very ,:dive with their Sword, and alfo in their
Councils ; fo alfo is the Bdtijh Government, to the no
fmall Mortification of the French Emperor. A mbafFadcts,
or Agents, are at Work '
to procure new Alliances, by
Marriage3, as well as o;her political Methods, LolTes
and Discouragements attend forne worthy Merchants; and

Of the EJlival or Summer Quarter.
This Quarter begins on Wednefday the 21 ft Day of June,
at 56 min. part 9 at Night, when the firft Degree of Sagi-
ttarius will be on the Cufp of the Medium Cceli : and the
29th Degree of Capricorn will be on the Afcendant ; the
Planets Saturn, Mars, and the Mocn, are then above the
Earth ; the refl of the Planets are below the Horizon. H
r.nd g are in a Zodiacal q , and Mars in & halting to a

ing to an (5 of ^ , and g of %, and of g in Can-
cer; Equinoctial and Tropical Signs. Thefe are fanguine
and malignant Afpe&s, implying no great Good to Man-
kind, in a political Senfe ; but on the contrary, fuch as
Commotions, Wars, and Bloodfheds, Seditions, Subver-
fions of Kingdoms and States, Alterations of Laws, Cuf^
tomsj &c. both in Church and State. Many eminent and
extraordinary events and Alterations will fhortly come to
pafs, and Ihew themfelves upon the Sta-ge of Europe. The
French as well as England appear very formidable, and
what the Confequei>ce will be Time will Ihew, J hope
Peace an 4 Tranquillity are ftill likely to icign in Ireland,
as I expect, fome Complaints from that Quarter; all Coun-
tries figh for a Ce/Iatlon of HoitilUies. At Rome we con-
tinue to difcern the Handwriting againit the Wall,

tembery at 4^ min. paft 1 1 o'CUck in the Morning, at
which Time we have 27 Deg. of Virgo culminating, and
firft Deg. of i , upon the Horofcope. The Pofitions and
Configurations, at this Ingrefs, denote Strife and Difcord
among all Degrees of Men ; but more efpccially amongft
Kings, Princoi, Senators, and thofe at the Helm of Af.
fairs, giving Disturbance and Fatigue to their Councils and

Rank, with Removals and Difgvace to thofe in Trulr, &c,

pofe the Torrent ; in which Enterprises the Arms of a
