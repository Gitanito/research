There is a huge fallacy in the “brain producing   consciousness” hypothesis that I’ve never seen addressed.

I would contend that if brains were   producing consciousness then we would not seem to be individuals!

This is one argument that seems to be   overlooked in the brain/mind debate. &nbsp;   One thing the skeptics say is that NDEs are the   same because brains are the same. &nbsp;   But if brains are the same and generating   consciousness then why do we seem to be individuals? &nbsp;   If my brain is producing my consciousness staring   out of the eyeballs of body TJS then the &quot;same&quot; brain in another body XXX should   be producing my consciousness there so I&#39;m staring out of two sets of eyeballs   and living two superimposed lives simultaneously. &nbsp;   Taken to it&#39;s logical conclusion there would be one   consciousness staring out of 7 billion human sets of eyeballs which would mean   that consciousness could only experience white noise! &nbsp;   This doesn&#39;t even take into account the billions of   other non-human brains on the planet.

The only thing the skeptics could say   would be that brains are the same but different! &nbsp;   The whole thing would be just more gibberish and   silliness on their part.

  Consider the following thought experiment.

  Let&#39;s say you find yourself existing, alive and conscious, in position 1.

  If you move to position 2 then obviously you would find yourself existing, alive   and conscious, there.

  Now instead of moving to position 2 an exact duplicate of you is created at   position 2.

  Where do you now find yourself to exist?

  Well what are the possibilities?

    a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         Cease to exist anywhere

    b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         Exist at 1 only

    c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         Exist at 2 only

    d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         Exist at 1 and 2

    e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         Oscillate between 1 and 2

  Which options seem more reasonable?

    a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         There’s no logical reason to believe that a duplication of your structure at 2   should cause you to stop existing at 1 so maybe we can eliminate this one.

    b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         Should be reasonable, you’re still at 1

    c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         Since we’ve done nothing to the structure at 1 there’s no reason to believe you   would find yourself only at 2.

    d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         Reasonable assuming the brain equals consciousness!

    e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         Since both the structures at 1 and 2 are continuous then there’s no reason to   believe you should be oscillating between those two positions.

  So it seems that only options b. and d. bear further discussion.

  Whatever the philosophy, religion, or science there should be some answer to   this thought experiment.

  Lets look at it from the three different theories that I believe encompass the   spectrum of possibilities.

  Dualism – consciousness and matter are separate and distinct

  Monistic Idealism – All consciousness is a single consciousness and   individuality is an illusion

  Materialism – matter creates consciousness

  Without attempting to explain where “spirits” come from,   Dualism has no real problem with the thought experiment. &nbsp;   You could have exact physical copies of a body and   still have two distinct individuals since each consciousness (spirit) is still   separate and unique. &nbsp;   It’s true that a third party would have no basis on   which to tell the copies apart but each copy would still consider itself an   individual existing in a specific location.

  Idealism also has no problem with the thought experiment. &nbsp;   Since individuality is an illusion the illusion of   individuality would also be complete between exact copies of any physical   structure. All consciousness is a single consciousness and expresses as all   forms. &nbsp;    You could replicate a form exactly billions of times and   each form would still consider itself to be an individual!

  How about materialism?

  At first glance the obvious answer would be b. &nbsp;   You still exist at position 1 and someone else that   looks and acts like you exists at position 2.

  For materialism however this presents a quandary. &nbsp;   Since both physical structures are identical and   structure is generating your consciousness as an epiphenomenon, then shouldn’t   you find yourself in the confusing position of being in two places at once?

  It would be the situation of living two superimposed realities simultaneously.

  If Material 1 =Consciousness 1, and Material 2 = Consciousness 2, and Material 1   = Material 2, then Consciousness 1 = Consciousness 2.

  Summarizing. If “you” exist at 1 because of brain 1 then ”you” must also exist   at 2 if an exact copy of brain 1 exists there.&nbsp;

  Further let’s say position 2 is 1 light year distant!

  Somehow &quot;you&quot; would be controlling 2 bodies instantaneously across that   distance. That would be macro scale &quot;action at a distance&quot;.

  One could claim that for an instant there would be only one   consciousness associated with 2 bodies but as soon as the experiences start to   differ the consciousness would differentiate or split but this is obviously   false. &nbsp;    No matter what experiences we have or decisions we make   consciousness seems to be continuous. &nbsp;   This would also make consciousness dependent on   experience and not the brain.

  So for a materialist it seems that only d. could hold! &nbsp;   If not then there is something non-material involved   with the generation of consciousness and materialism is refuting itself.

  Now the materialist would just have to explain what to change in brain 2 to   create a different consciousness and thereby create two different people looking   out of two identical bodies!

  They would somehow have to identify an &quot;Individuality Module&quot; in each brain and   relate that to an individualized consciousness. How could consciousness or pure   awareness be individualized? What would be the measurable parameters?

  This “Individuality Module” would have to explain the structural differences in   7 billion human brains on the planet that creates an individualized   consciousness each time and the materialist must be able to measure that   consciousness directly and verify it’s individuality.

  The whole thing for the materialist quickly becomes   impossible. &nbsp;    They can not now and never will be able to address the   points above.

  I would contend that the theory that most easily satisfies the implications of   this thought experiment with a minimum of paradox must be the closest to the   truth.&nbsp;

  Monistic Idealism explains everything without contradiction or paradox.

  We are all One Consciousness existing outside of time and   space looking into this universe through the vehicle of every life form. &nbsp;   In the process, as a function of focus, the illusion   of individuality occurs. &nbsp;   A form could be replicated exactly billions of times   and each form would still consider itself to be an individual!

  This description of reality is reported over and over again by the NDErs and   constitutes experimental verification of the theory.

Ironically by examining our existence as seeming individual   physical entities in the universe we find that that is exactly what we are not.    </body>
