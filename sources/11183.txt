  		              		Experience Description   

  I experienced this when I was 18 years old. I  got the flu during the tests for a mock exam. I was probably very dehydrated and lost consciousnes. I don't know how long I was out  because time is totally relative and has no sense anymore. I was not  aware of time. I didn't have any religious convictions or   beliefs about the afterlife. At the time, I didn't even know that this type of experience existed. I did some research afterwards and understood that I wasn't the only one who had this experience.
  
  When I was unconscious, I didn't feel my own body anymore. Everything was at the same time long and extremely fast.  I saw the good moments of my life scrolling at top speed. Then I saw the tunnel. I saw a white and yellow light that was  brilliant, yet  soft and not burning like the sun. 

  Then I saw my grandmother who was deceased in real life. She was radiating light and happy. There was a halo of light surrounding her that prevented me  seeing what was behind her. My grandmother was neither old nor young, it was odd so I wouldn't know how to describe it. I talked to her.  She told me to go back because we couldn't stay any longer. She told me that it wasn't my time and that I still had things to do.
  
  When I woke up, I felt a strong pain from hitting my head. While falling I hit the edge of the tub and scratched my arm. At the moment when my relative told me to go, I opened my eyes to see my father shaking me to revive me.
