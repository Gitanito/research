 This was both a relic of and a throwback to more halcyon days.  Its feature articles usually were reprints of old pieces by the likes of J.M. Peebles, Emma Hardinge Britten, and Cora L.V. Richmond, supplemented with new material by Sylvan Muldoon (on astral projection), Charles Fillmore (of Unity), and others, and with articles on famous spiritualists of the past like P.L.O.A. Keeler, and the journal was still featuring in the mid-1940s advertisements for aluminum spirit trumpets and slates for slate writing.  It also published in the early days the program for the annual Lily Dale Assembly.  The journal is especially valuable for its numerous advertisements for then-current mediums, camps, and spiritualist groups.  It is said that the journal fell upon hard times when, in 1960, at the behest of Andrija Puharich, it published an expose, complete with photographs, of the fraud of several prominent mediums at Camp Chesterfield who were engaged in faking materializations.  In 1974 the journal was merged with another failing journal -- Chimes -- to form Psychic Observer and Chimes.
