  		              		Experience Description   

    My high temperature must have caused me to be in and out of consciousness. While lying in the hospital bed, I  remember a nurse placing large towels that were soaked in ice-water over my body.  I could occasionally feel the cold shock when she placed the towels on me but then I remember not feeling the cold shock any longer. I then  felt myself leave the bed and was  up in a corner of the room. I watched the nurse continue placing the cold towels on my body.  I'm not sure of the duration of the out of body experience but I remember being back in the bed and feeling the cold shocks. The doctor told my parents that I 'almost died'.  It's an experience that will be with me always.
