my name is graham Bethune I&#39;m a
commander retired pilot from the Navy
and I went through the regular Navy
program of training pilots I graduated
in 1943 from Pensacola the Academy there
and of course all Navy pilots are
trained navigators which is very
important when you&#39;re going to talk
about what we&#39;re talking about because
we we had to know all this the star
systems and we had to know these type of
things I navigated maybe 13 years around
the planet with the Stars and I when I
first graduated from Pensacola in 1943 I
went to the South Atlantic and we were
hunting German submarines this was all
night flying everything we did was at
night that time being in patrol planes
when I was transferred to air transport
squadron one in 1950 here again we were
flying most of the earth&#39;s surface is
water and you&#39;re flying over the ocean
so you&#39;re navigating with the Stars and
I was sent to Keflavik Iceland along
with two other officers after a meeting
that they&#39;d had in Washington DC where
Iceland was involved and seeing things
over Keflavik Iceland and they wanted
troops up there to protect them
during our meeting they were explaining
to us why they had requested the troops
and what they were seeing and we asked
him if it could really go into more
detail about the type of craft that they
were seeing in their explanation they
were seeing most of midnight lighted
craft circular and we knew coming from a
Naval Air test center we tested
everything there that we had nothing
like that that we tested so I asked him
this is what did our government tell you
they were and they said your government
said they were experimental probably
experimental Russian bombers flight day
we had an encounter with some Keflavik
Iceland Argentine new phone and as we
took off at the 9th of February and of
course we flew through midnight which it
measures about 30 minutes eight to
midnight this is a position we&#39;re in
here and that&#39;s where the encounter took
place the flight was normally about 10
hours but that night we had a 60 knot
win and was a headwind and about maybe
300 to 400 miles outside of Keflavik I
mean out of out of our gingy I&#39;m sorry I
saw something below the horizon on the
water that looked like approaching a
city at night it was just kind of an
ambient light no definition whatsoever
but the same thing that you would see if
you were approaching a large city at
night so I watched it for a while it was
about 1 o&#39;clock and then finally I
called a kingdom&#39;s attention who was
sitting in the right seat who he was
route checking me and he took a look at
it and he didn&#39;t know what it was we
couldn&#39;t figure out there was nothing
out there we had passed over the guard
ship back in those days they had a guard
ship but that was between Iceland and
between new flemm the guard ship had
given us the latest weather the weather
was clear there was now Northern Light
activity which they gives part of the
weather report and we had to we had ship
pots there were no ships plotted in that
area so we asked kogure if he could give
us another fix and find out if we were
really on course we thought maybe we had
drifted
we were seeing Labrador the coastal a
burrow or maybe a the tip of Greenland
so he said no we were right on course so
we watched it for a while and we were
drifting to the right of it and where
our heading was 222 degrees 225 degrees
and that education as we became I would
say we were at 10,000 feet I would say
it was 40 miles away originally in the
end the vicinity 40 oddly when we were
about 25 or 30 miles away we could see
define lights and it was a pattern on a
water so with that pattern we couldn&#39;t
figure out what was going on maybe the
Navy was doing something it was highly
classified recovering something out in
the ocean or something of this nature so
that was our thoughts and and it was a
circular pattern and it was very large I
mean just I couldn&#39;t estimate the size
of it so I sent the the crew chief back
to get the plane other plane commander
al Jones because they wanted to land at
our genji so when the crew was coming up
from back half there were 31 passengers
and we had two VP cruise which had
pilots also in a patrol planes and at
the time that they came forward the
lights went out on the water there was
nothing on our this is about 15 miles
away I mean it was dark
now standing behind me was the navigator
the radio Minh and also the plane
captain plus them the cockpit was full
and they were heads all over the place
and all of a sudden we saw on the water
yellow halo that was very very small
about 15 miles away and it came up to
ten thousand feet like that that
fraction of a second and I thought it
was going to go right through us and I
disengaged the auto part pushing those
over because I was going to go on it at
the angle it was coming toward me so
what happened the minute that I did that
it was up at our altitude and I could
see nothing outside of the cockpit but
this crash and and and so I didn&#39;t know
which way to go and then all of a sudden
I heard
I don&#39;t know what it was that&#39;s it Fred
what the hell was that
he looked Renesas oh he said everyone
was ducking bomb in the back of us and
he Clyde in here all lay on the deck
deck back there scrambling on a day so
when I looked back it wasn&#39;t there and
he says it&#39;s over here on the right hand
side now it was about a mile or so away
on the right hand side it kind of
drifted forward maybe to position maybe
five miles away and that&#39;s where it
stayed with us for quite some time this
is when we could first see it wasn&#39;t
above our our altitude it was below our
altitude but it&#39;s still above the
horizon where you could see the side of
the craft you could see the dome and you
can see the color around the perimeter
of the craft and then we knew that it
was a friendly encounter we knew it knew
we were there we knew it came out to see
us and but we didn&#39;t think at that time
that the reason it did it did this is
because they want to show us what the
Icelanders were talking about so we we
watched it for a while and I&#39;ll says
we&#39;ll let me let him get in the seat so
I let him get in the seat and and and he
disengaged the autopilot was going to
chase it when I we had a ground speed of
his head went about 60 knots our ground
speed was maybe only 120 130 knots and
so he wasn&#39;t going to go too far in
chasing this thing but he did turn to
chase it so I decided I would go back
you have to see how the patient is
reacted and also talked to the doctor it
was back there he used to make the trip
over his had a daughter going to school
in London and and so I went to him first
I said doc did you would see what we saw
and he says yeah he says you look me
straight in the eye he says yeah he says
it was a flying saucer he says I didn&#39;t
look at it because I don&#39;t believe in
such things well it took me a couple
seconds to recognize it he couldn&#39;t
believe Vinnitsa Koch&#39;s and in that so I
went back a Ford and I said doubt
whatever you do don&#39;t tell anybody we
saw anything a lock his episodes we get
on the ground he said it&#39;s too late he
says I just called Gander to control to
see if they could track this by radar so
that&#39;s how the it got out so when we
landed it Argentia the Air Force was
there and they interrogated us
and the captain that did the
interrogation did a real good job
but you could tell that this wasn&#39;t his
first time that he&#39;d ever interrogated
anybody his for so they scruffy
the water was yellow around now since
then I&#39;ve learned not long add to that I
learned from will say the boys upstairs
why we saw different colors as it was
coming toward us
the colors were around a perimeter it
was kind of at an angle to where you
could not see the back ring of the
crappers around the perimeter of the
craft it had turned from a yellow to an
orange to almost a fiery red and then it
almost a purplish red and they said that
had to do with the amount of energy used
being used or discipline it had to do
with the power so to speak and so when
it slowed down close to us infraction a
second it was back to the yellow range
and it was foggy all around it to wear
like a plasma or a mist or something of
this nature now as far as any lights
there were no lights that we saw this
was just around a perimeter when it was
out where most of the crew members were
the people in back of the airplane saw
it it was fire in color every report
everyone I&#39;m stated that in the report
that we got out of the archives everyone
said fire in color ring fire in color we
had like a knowing when that question
was asked it was 300 feet to Cayman
Lemon and when I&#39;ve got the report out
of the archives in 1991 I&#39;d never seen
anybody elses report
everyone had be aware of 250 to 350 feet
in diameter and when I talk to others is
it was just something that they knew and
estimate now the velocity when it left
us was estimated from between 8:00
between a thousand miles an hour to
2,000 miles an hour and when I looked at
the report al Jones estimated 1,800
miles an hour
mine was a thousand another one was
1,500 miles but I in that range it turns
out that the radar report which I&#39;ve
never seen said it was 1,800 miles an
hour so the other plane commander was
sitting in the seat took my seat he hit
it right on a nose and of course I was
at the Naval Air test center this is
where we train the astronauts and this
is where we had our test pilot training
school this is where we did all the
highly classified
test of aircraft and to my knowledge we
had nothing but anywhere in your
approach to speed or anything it was
circular
we&#39;re flying at 10,000 feet and it says
drop like that you&#39;re in another
aircraft flying 90 degrees to this
aircraft in this direction but you&#39;re
5,000 feet so we would be in this height
here we would count seconds be at 1,000
one would be a second well it wasn&#39;t
quite a sec that&#39;s it or maybe two at
the very most
now that was 15 miles did it covered in
that short period of time you could
calculate how fast it came toward us and
just like you just put the brakes on him
in front of it but you take something
three feet in diameter at 300 feet in
diameter and look out you don&#39;t see much
out there not even cockpit window then
this is a light pattern that we saw then
in this position here there was no
lights and this is a little yellow halo
and this is the way it came up to it in
fact I&#39;ve been corresponding with a
magnetic engineer for several years it&#39;s
writing a book he&#39;s already got pretty
close to 100 pilot reports and I gave
him in detail everything had happened I
went to set the automatic pilot back and
the the magnetic compass was in the
center of the panel was swinging back
and forth I said to Fred I said did you
see that he said you should have seen it
when the craft was closed he said it was
spinning and so then we looked at the
others now at that time the craft was
sitting out maybe five miles from us we
had what we call bird dogs or a low
frequency radio prompt or as it will
point to the station when you tune in
the station these two bird dogs were
pointing towards the craft just like
this
we had another we had two other
compasses we had a remote compass which
is out in a wing which doesn&#39;t anything
affect it but it was reacting now what I
set the the instruments back on was that
we had a vacuum operated directional
gyro and in the auto pot we had a
hydraulically operated gyro so none of
these were affected so I was able to sit
there at sera course back using those
but those were the things that we
noticed that a total of five different
directional gyros in an air
and out of the five three of them were
acting up
it was tracked by radar that same trip
flying the troops I&#39;ve had said Fred did
you know that it was trapper always said
yeah I knew that two weeks after it
happened I said why did you tell me I
said the report go and he&#39;s as far as he
knows he said the one that he talked to
is that it was sent in to the air force
headquarters in Washington DC
it usually goes from there to
wright-patterson this where it was sent
so but when we got my boss that&#39;s
another thing when he found the report
in the archives and wright-patterson on
Project Blue Book and talking to with
Colonel Watson when he came back to me
he gave me the speed of 1800 says where
did you find that out and he said well
it was a radar report it said that so
something happened to the radar report
before the microphone because what I
have on microphone I got from the
archives I was told by a friend of mine
there that known for years that they had
allowed Steven Spielberg to microfilm
this the Blue Book records for whatever
close encounter to third count or
something of this nature so he had a
pretty high clearance he had to be his
self associated with some of it well you
know as far as the Martin chardee agency
is concerned the other plane come at her
I located Oh many years ago when he was
with this company that he wouldn&#39;t talk
after he retired I got a home again in
1996 and I flew out to where he lived I
said what we&#39;ll do is we&#39;ll just take
the tape record we&#39;ll both discuss it
and it says in later on I&#39;ll have
somebody else interviews so they don&#39;t
have to believe so that&#39;s what happened
his rate he in the report that I wrote
his statement is in there several pages
of his name is his schematic of what he
saw was in there and it was amazing how
how they matched this is what they saw
they saw it under the wing seeing right
here so we figure it was in his position
here at the time that they saw it though
the document that I found was the
official document that the Air Force had
put together different sources it came
to them and it was originally file it
was under project grudge you can see and
they&#39;re written
grudge but on the front page it says
project twinkle now this is where they
put a lot of ones that they had to get
rid of some house project twinkle so it
it was in project Bluebook in project
reg and what other project I don&#39;t know
that was in it said it was 18 pages
according the archives but they only
found 17 on a film sale it could have
been a radar report it could have been
anything and I was flying at that time
Admiral McCormick who had relieved
Eisenhower and when McCormick was a NATO
commander the supreme Allied commander
now his aides it approached me everybody
seemed to know about because it wasn&#39;t a
highly classified like Atma Radford who
became the first Joint Chiefs of Staff
his aides knew about it because it
talked to me about it so it&#39;s quite a
few that knew knew about this so this is
where I learned a lot that really was
not official but and it was really not
in any books this of course is the
flight over Washington DC if you
remember in 1952 July the 20th and of
course this was after our encounter and
what just did it help us prove our
sanity to our friends because they
didn&#39;t believe what we saw they had to
do is observe visit when I we came back
after taking the troops up when we came
back this was in May I had an
intelligence officer come through the
house and and he he was he didn&#39;t seem
like that he was that much interested in
the reports that he was working on there
with me and he showed me pictures the
first picture that ever seen me there
was nothing absolutely nothing there
that even looked close to it it was one
it was he claimed was a hundred feet in
diameter pretty close to on her feet so
ever do didn&#39;t look like it was damaged
too much and and so is the one I asked a
lot of questions is what happens to this
this report he told me exactly what
happened he says there is a committee no
visitors there is a traffic Joint
Intelligence Committee of course you
have to realize the Air Force of forum
47 it was only natural he got each one
had a
intelligence committee and so they had a
Joint Intelligence Committee and he said
and they make the decision as to where
it goes to because they were coming to
me a lot of times and showing me
photographs a lot of them looked like
what we said would call Foo Fighters a
lot of them look like just a round
bright disc of some kind now I&#39;ve got it
was a secretary of Navy Kimball I was at
what you call a VIP plane commander in
the flag division which flew most of the
high-ranking officers and civilians out
of Washington DC and and we had several
of those now they they told me what they
saw they were to craft flying together
out in the Pacific and it was just a
bright disc that came up beside when I&#39;m
in stayed with him for a while flew
around it and it couldn&#39;t estimate the
size it at 5,200 feet in diameter our
office came under the headquarter at
wright-patterson were it was a Central
District that means all the bureau
Aeronautics reps in the Central District
that would be the test pilot so any of
the officers in these plants that were
test pilot or accepting airplanes this
type of thing so you had to have
engineering meeting you had pilot
meetings you had all these all these
type of meetings and I would go down
there about once or twice a month into
the meetings plus I would go maybe two
or three times a year for seminars we&#39;d
have it be a week so on the flight line
where we parked our plane was the time
we weren&#39;t too far from look like a
hangar looked like corrugated metal
hanger and it was open most the time
every time my boss and I go by there he
he couldn&#39;t understand why I was not
interested in going and looking at what
was behind the metal wall back there and
he told me basically that they had a
craft back there and he told me
basically they did have bodies there now
he&#39;s not the first one had ever told me
that after he found our report in
project Bluebook down there then he
became interested himself because the
discussions he had had the discussions
he&#39;d had with Admiral Forney because
atma Forney was our missile
and he&#39;d spent time at White Sands that
Admiral Forney was convinced that the
craft from other planets were visiting
us and after this is when he became
aware and he did the the officer that he
was talking to was Colonel Watson
because he kept bringing up Colonel
Washington name so he was allowed Carol
Watson let him look at a lot of these
files plus he was the one that told him
about what they had there he saw what
they had there and as I said he couldn&#39;t
understand why I was out I said well I
really I don&#39;t have any interest I said
I&#39;ll never be able to talk about it and
I know enough now from what I&#39;ve seen
that that I know they exist and that
then but I really had no interest in
seeing and in many he had two or three
times he hates me same thing and he was
it was a craft it was a craft that did
crash somewhere extraterrestrial crafts
exactly the LA time had I had a
top-secret clearance but here we get
back to the need-to-know and and I&#39;m
sure that in a lot of cases that the
other people had the need to know about
certain things that I didn&#39;t have and
yet to realize this is where the army
and I guess eventually Air Force two
with the Army Navy had their
aeronautical engineers there basically
they had a lot of training that they
went through there and and so I&#39;m sure
if we had anything from another planet
that some of these engineers would be
involved whether we&#39;re magnetic
engineers or aeronautical engineers or
whatever they were they&#39;d be involved
and looking and of course I&#39;m sure a lot
of moods would be civilian too just so
many things that I can&#39;t being in the
military what do you think the generals
and admirals would would think when they
hear there&#39;s something out there a
couple of these little craft could
destroy all of their forces and it one
thing and actually that their jobs to
well I&#39;m sure that as we all know that
Muroc which is a Edwards Air Force Base
I&#39;m sure I&#39;m sure that they are a lot of
places that have underground facilities
I can state one in you Kern in your Kern
I think it bets China Lake or close to
it that was the
reporter I delivered a transport there
at one time and and of course they
wouldn&#39;t let me go anywhere the duty
officer would go to lunch with me and
what have you do and he told me some
things about some things they says once
you come here you don&#39;t leave and I knew
that they had what he indicated tell me
outright what was there but there&#39;s no
question my mind it was a lot of top
secret work done there and a lot of
things that we don&#39;t know about I do
know that we did bring some of the
crafts back from Germany after World War
two because in a plant that we had there
in Detroit we gave the army some space
for the Redstone Jupiter missile may
have had some v2 rockets there that they
brought back and talking a lot of these
engineers Wernher von Braun his brother
Homer I&#39;m sure that that that some of
the technology that he brought back from
Germany then it could has probably been
done all over the place in fact coursers
but I was involved in some things that
I&#39;m suspicious that were of the same
nature where they were asking us to see
if we could find a contractor in the
area they could build something like
this or back injury or something like it
and then we never thought about it when
he said well it wasn&#39;t our technology
before so what you know the Germans had
much higher technology than we did my
son was about eight years old and we
were sodding the backyard and I went
into the house to wash up and he came
into the houses dead mommy wants you
outside I says what for he says we&#39;re
looking at flying saucers I thought to
myself what the heck does he know about
flying saucers so I go outside and here
she is standing and pointing to
something up above it you know what it
was a small mothership about the size of
the attempt ski ship and it was small
crap all around so I go back in the
house get the binoculars because I want
to get a good look at this so I come
back and the ship itself had gone but I
got a chance to see two or three of the
smallest and they were identical with
the little three balls underneath and
what have you for the George Dempsey
crap so you know when we got back now so
it&#39;s my wife I said well how did you
find out about [ __ ] saucers because
we were not supposed to tell her even
our wives and I recount which was in 51
she said I know she was explaining to
him how they launched him and retrieve
him Nepal at the top she was explaining
this process and she said I read your
book by George Adamski inside spaceships
I said you bought that book I said do
you believe if he was telling truth they
told me he was crazy and she says well
didn&#39;t you you just saw it out there so
now what do you do I&#39;m convinced that
what I saw was to my knowledge we
wouldn&#39;t have had anything that size and
and I&#39;m certain that it was from another
plant on a filter not from this planet
it&#39;s nothing our technology was not such
at that time that we could have any kind
of a craft like that I&#39;m sure
you
