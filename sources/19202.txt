my name is michael w smith I was in the
Air Force from 1969 to 1973 that was
aircraft control and early warning
operator which was basically an aircraft
control personally with air lanes and
stuff like that
our job was to was for the military
aircraft sight was to track and give
altitudes to the for military aircraft
or their flights also to detect and
identify any incoming aircraft coming
into our airspace in spring of 1970
while stationed in Klamath Falls Oregon
I came up to the radar site an evening
shift and where there&#39;s normally two or
three people in the radar room there was
quite a few from the cooks to the
maintenance all kinds of people and I
asked what was going on and he said that
there&#39;s watching a UFO and I immediately
was stunned and asked if the Pentagon
was notified somebody called the
president or and they said no they don&#39;t
do that and I said well we should call
the news meet here
call sometimes call somebody this was
earth-shaking news and to me any said no
just calm down NORAD knows about they
called Nuria and that&#39;s when the senior
NCO pulled me to the side and said that
know where I&#39;d knows about it that&#39;s the
only people we notify we don&#39;t talk
about this
we don&#39;t tell anybody about this the
people no no and we just watch see what
happens and that&#39;s it that&#39;s our job and
I insisted though there has to be a
report filed or something filed you know
and he said well that there is a report
that you can file it&#39;s about an inch
thick and the first two pages is about
the citing the rest of it is basically a
psychological profile of you your family
you know we bloodlines everything so
when the Air Force goes through it they
can discredit you completely by either
saying that you know you was on drugs or
your mother was a communist or anything
to discredit you and you&#39;d never get a
promotion and I&#39;d spend the next three
and a half years of the north pole was
living in a tent checking whether bones
you know hope promotion so the message
is pretty loud and clear you just shut
up and don&#39;t say anything to anybody
it was stationary wasn&#39;t moving at all
and it would slowly lower itself down
until it got behind of a mountain so you
lost radar contact it would stay down
for about 15 minutes and like saying it
was right back up there it was up you
know 80 90 thousand feet and then the
next the next sweep of the radar scope
it would be you know like 200 miles away
stationary completely stopped and went
over there for five ten minutes and then
slowly start descending until it dropped
off radar then it would come back up and
it did this like three times and that I
seen I heard that it that&#39;s not an
infrequent occurrence out there I am
quite often but I seen it actually twice
the object that that we&#39;ve seen it was
stationary and then the next sweep of
the scope which radar has six sweeps of
site a minute six sweeps a minute would
you know one sweep it would be here next
we pit would be 200 miles away
completely staffed and there&#39;s no
aircraft that can accelerate and
decelerate that fast without having the
pilots face through the windshield you
know I mean it&#39;s impossible for gravity
to operate that way so is obviously
something we didn&#39;t have we never
scramble interceptors on them so it&#39;s
obviously something Russians never had
it&#39;s was that it was a UFO that&#39;s the
only explanation it was for it in fact
that you know NORAD that we called NORAD
they knew about or they call it would
call us to tell us NORAD knew about it
like I said they just handle it like
it&#39;s just it&#39;s just UFO just you know
just watch it and see what happens but
don&#39;t take any actions don&#39;t tell
anybody you know write it down don&#39;t
disclose it
Nora is North American Air Defense
Command they&#39;re in charge of all the
airspace of the United States of North
America and it&#39;s their job to identify
any incoming aircraft any threats any
Russian planes or any or any aircraft at
all and so the first thing they do is it
any blip that comes in that they don&#39;t
know what it is they check it with the
flight plans of love Airlines or private
carriers or whatever and it was so
everything is identified so when
something like this just pops up on a
scope with no flight plan and doing
erratic behaviors it&#39;s their job to
identify it they have a tie-in with all
radar stations in North America it all
goes to shyam out in these so they have
like a big screen and they can they can
see any area of the country at any time
and so they that&#39;s how they know like
for instance this other experience was
on third shift I was on the radar and
NORAD called me and informed me that
there was a UFO coming up to California
coast and be in my area pretty soon so I
said what you want me to do and they
said nothing just just watch it don&#39;t
write it down you know because we have a
logbook that we supposed to keep track
of any anything out of use out of the
ordinary you know as far as maintenance
things like a oh that&#39;s in a logbook and
they said don&#39;t log it or anything just
just watch it we&#39;re just letting you
know
heads-up so NORAD was well aware
obviously that was there they were
around and from the action of the people
when I first seen my first experience
seeing the radar was a UFO landing of
the people there was like you know
doesn&#39;t have everyday that you know it
happens quite often and that was my
impression and because of a just
everybody so it&#39;s just to go home just
so calm you know I&#39;m all frantic and
stuff but apparently the first time you
see a UFO when radar you know you
realize you know the government knows
about this way why aren&#39;t they telling
the press lion you know the radar they
would be on the radar because it&#39;s very
mountainous out there until it got to a
point where the radar wouldn&#39;t behind a
mountain then obviously would disappear
off the radar and I don&#39;t know if it
actually landed NAB but it was off the
radar for a good 15 20 minutes before
all of a sudden boom it&#39;s back up you&#39;re
90,000 feet instantly it was explained
that yes their UFOs yes we know them but
yes NORAD knows about them but that&#39;s it
this is a secret they&#39;re not supposed to
talk about it don&#39;t tell anybody about
it don&#39;t make any reports don&#39;t write it
down just shut up and you&#39;ll get your
next stripe and you&#39;d be promoted and
you will go on from there my second
encounter was lava station sue st. Marie
Michigan it was in 1972 I believe was in
the fall of 1972
I was working alone that night but then
I was promoted to a sergeant
I was working alone that night when I
got a phone call from the switchboard
operator he said he had state police on
the phone and wanted to talk to me
and I&#39;m thinking you know I have parking
ticket overdue or something but he was
real frantic when he got on the phone
and said that there&#39;s three UFOs over
the North Tower the Mackinac Bridge
Mackinac Bridge connects the Upper
Peninsula and Lower Peninsula of
Michigan so I immediately you know
turned on the radar and but my rig
immediate response was there&#39;s nothing
on radar and I hung up the phone just
it&#39;s just something that&#39;s programmed
into you that&#39;s what you&#39;re supposed to
say there&#39;s nothing on radar even if you
see something the North Tower seemed to
be a little bit bigger and then I
realized that there was they were the
UFOs and one took off left the other two
and circled Mackinac Island and came
back to the other three then all three
started going following Interstate 75
north from st. Ignace in the meantime I
got calls from the Sheriff&#39;s Department
they were frantic saying you know we&#39;re
chasing these UFOs up the highway and my
response was there&#39;s nothing on radar
several people called several civilians
I believe there&#39;s a newspaper person
called and in the meantime I I called
NORAD and told them and they looked and
they looked it up and they said oh it&#39;s
coming up they&#39;re going up i-75 it
suggests at about 70 80 miles an hour
now about halfway between st. Ignace and
su st. Maria&#39;s cancel Air Force Base
which is a sac basis they have b-52
bombers they had two apparently that
we&#39;re on final approach and that crosses
i-75
and so apparently they diverted those
two bombers because they didn&#39;t want you
know if they have nuclear weapons or not
but they didn&#39;t want to take a chance on
them meeting UFOs about the same
altitude cross an Iowan so they diverted
the two b-52s as the UFOs came closer I
realized if they keep going this way
following the highway we go right by the
radar site which is up on top of like a
hill right at SU st. Marie bright bluish
glow followed by the flashing red and
blue lights and the police cars that
were chasing it so I realized well I&#39;m
not going to be able to see it so I went
back in looked at the scope they were
gone one back outside couldn&#39;t see any
went back to scope
when they asked if I had it on radar I
told them no it&#39;s more of a programmed
response thinking back to will Klamath
Falls where you&#39;re told you don&#39;t talk
about it you don&#39;t write it down you
don&#39;t discuss it I was afraid if I said
oh yeah say I have them on radar that
the next thing I know newspapers are
going to be up there wanted talk to me
and stuff and I would probably get
court-martialed err I don&#39;t know what
would happen it was just instinct saying
there&#39;s nothing on radar when it
actually was I was I was watching him
come up the highway it they were so
close together look like one returned
and was looked like it was one aircraft
but it was very low the only thing I did
was in the logbook Haverhill wrote this
down wrote the information down and I
told my senior NCO the next day about it
but that&#39;s all you&#39;re supposed to do
don&#39;t tell anybody else don&#39;t write it
down although I did write it down but I
doubt if you ever find that book a
logbook when I seen this blue glow come
by it was probably a hundred yards away
with a weather highway is it was it was
bright but not super bright but was
totally silent the only sound I could
hear was the sirens from the police cars
that were about a hundred yards behind
it and I could see the strobing light of
the other other flashers of there
other beacons they cover up we don&#39;t
want anybody talk about it you know this
is such remarkable technologies people
come from who knows where that I would
think you want everybody to know
one of the firaon a personal note after
this happened from in Oregon and I came
home on leave and told my dad about it
he was red white and blue threw him
through World War two hero on all this
and very patriotic and I was explaining
to him but these UFOs that we&#39;ve seen
Lee seen out there and he said no he
says the government says there are no
UFOs I&#39;ve seen dad I seen these you know
on radar with my own eyes and so he was
torn when the government would never lie
to him you know there&#39;s a son I&#39;ve never
lied to him so he just didn&#39;t know what
to do and it wasn&#39;t till years later -
after Watergate that he he said you know
he sit down tell me about this I&#39;m like
if it&#39;s lying to me you know about
little thing like that
I was severe I lying about something big
that&#39;s a government cover-up that
doesn&#39;t need to be here anymore there&#39;s
no more cold cold war I believe the same
thing dr. Greer does that the technology
they have you know we&#39;re burning our
fossil fuels up faster than you know the
ozone and everything these people have
technologies they have it&#39;s hard what do
they have they must have something and
the government knows about they have
these you know they have these aliens
they have these spacecrafts they have
this technology all this there&#39;s a lot
of back engineered technology that&#39;s
pretty obvious
I mean what else have they got what and
why who are they to cover this up when
other governments coming forward and
mitting and showing their files
why aren&#39;t why why isn&#39;t our government
Claus in the Air Force there was a
number of people that had witnessed UFOs
under radar also a number of pilots have
talked to they had chased them or come
close to him or fly in formation with
him when he come down to land a friend
of mine was like in the tower and
there&#39;s a flight of three coming in
of interceptors and he said no there&#39;s
four of it
captain&#39;s going on there&#39;s three of us
he said we&#39;ll look around sure enough
there was UFO flying formation with him
when dr. Greer brought us down to
Washington DC for the briefing I was
very nervous and didn&#39;t know what to
expect however there was about twelve
other people there that really amazed me
my story is very tame compared to what
they&#39;ve experienced what they&#39;ve
encountered and it&#39;s it was a real
eye-opener how deep the secrecy goes how
deep the cover-up is everyone from
astronauts to you know senators and
stuff but that know there&#39;s something I
want
you
