as you know we&#39;ve just launched this et
contact app which is fun it&#39;s kind of
more of a website than an app it&#39;s a
basic app but basically if you don&#39;t
have you go to ET contact network calm
and and download it&#39;ll put it on your
smartphone Android or iPhone and it will
you will register and then you will come
up then you&#39;ll see who else is in your
area people have been asking for this
for ten or ten years how do I get hold
of someone who wants to do the close
encounters of the fifth kind contact
protocols in Iowa and we didn&#39;t we don&#39;t
have any by the way we have no office or
personnel like I says my wife and I and
some volunteers are doing all this we
don&#39;t have an office we don&#39;t have a
secretary we don&#39;t have anything
everything&#39;s done so there&#39;s this
wonderful volunteer who did this app for
us I met him at a retreat training to
make contact up in Arizona six months
ago he says oh I can I&#39;ll do this for
you so he just volunteered his time to
do it he&#39;s a very busy tech guy and so
we&#39;ve launched that there going to be
more features coming but the nice thing
about spreading the word for that is
that anyone who wants to involve be
involved in the ce-5 contact work in a
local area or if you travel you can move
the map and zoom into that say you&#39;re
going to LA and you can say oh I&#39;m in
the area you guys anybody they&#39;re gonna
do anything or if you want to support
just education you may want to just get
together with people and host a
screening of an educational screening of
serious in your community or you may
want to do something to get together
with people who want to work on general
disclosure issues and and educate that
your community or you may want to find
some people who are interested in these
technology and free energy aspects of
this that you can network with in your
local community you can use it for all
those purposes isn&#39;t just for the cd5
initiative but but that&#39;s why it was
initially conceived as because we had so
many team members from all over the
world and what was awesome was that the
night we launched it we launched it like
1:00 in the morning I hit the button and
within hours every single cotton was lit
up with little C City logo triangle
it was so much fun to watch and and now
it&#39;s literally every continent almost
every country where there are people so
it&#39;s very very exciting so that&#39;s a
great way for people to plug in to each
other and there there is some confusion
about that app versus the what&#39;s called
the et contact tool which is on serious
disclosure com
that is actually a whole training
program that goes through the protocols
of remote viewing meditation the
techniques of the ce-5 initiative it
actually will take your your your
smartphone and turn it into a
magnetometer that that will will pick up
magnetic field changes if a craft is
near you even if it&#39;s not visible it may
be transdimensional and translucent but
it will set that off all kinds of cool
features and that is something that is
separate that&#39;s the more of a training
and educational tool this networking app
the et contact network.com is purely so
people can contact each other that&#39;s all
it does eventually we may be able to get
it to so where people can actually have
chat or I am in it and there are all
kinds of features that it doesn&#39;t have
that many people wanted to have and I
said well this was one man with his
volunteer efforts while he&#39;s running his
own business doing this so I mean this
is again yeah please understand that
everything we do from the disclosure
project National Press Club event all
the books the film Sirius except for the
production company everyone involved
with that where volunteers work for free
so we don&#39;t have any paid staff and we
don&#39;t have so when we get something like
this it&#39;s because someone said I&#39;ll do
it for you which is great the man is he
wants to remain anonymous but he&#39;s just
an amazing person
