    Summary&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Today’s Astrology.
 Success, Know Your Destiny, Happiness
 1935--1945  Monthly, bi-monthly
 Mount Morris, IL.  Publisher: Magna Publications (A.L. Kirby).  Editor: Irvin Ray, editor; Selby Maxwell, Christina Dahl, associate editors.
  1/1, 1935-10/2, April-May 1945.  $2.00 a year, 74 pp.

 This was a run-of-the-mill attempt at a popular astrological journal.  It had no didactic articles on astrology or its finer points but contented itself with the standard Daily Guides for the signs, which provided the bulk of the journal, together with columns for answers to letters, Aspect Charts, Market Advice, "Your Health Astrologically," etc., and general articles on the likes of "Your Love Life Can Be Happier" by James P. Basalek, Key Lloyd, Robert E. Dean, and other unknowns.  Selby Maxwell had a weather column for the Chicago Tribune and a column on "What Makes a Beautiful Woman?" and Christina Dahl found her way into Rose Dawn’s Modern Astrology.  The journal  featured the inevitable advertisements for AMORC in San Jose and for Brotherhood of Light Lessons, and ran an intriguing notice for the "Hetquaz System of Numerology" by Rose Juanita Jones of Marion, Ohio, who also ran a correspondence school.
