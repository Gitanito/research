at that point I was commissioned the
second lieutenant in the Regular Army we
were living in same house outside of
Langley field which at that time had a
large facility of naca which was the
predecessor of NASA the National
Advisory Committee of aeronautics I was
used to hearing airplanes fly over the
house all the time but this one night it
was probably around 7:30 or 8 o&#39;clock
I heard the swishing noise come by the
house and it was fast but it was so
totally unique and strange that it made
an impression on me I had no idea what
it was until I began hearing about some
of the the Foo Fighters in Germany that
had come out that were jet propelled and
I could draw a correlation between the
two very easily
you
after the war was over we began bringing
a lot of things back from overseas
I remember they brought a German u-boat
to Fort Monroe to the piers at Fort
Monroe and during the same period of
time NACA had an open house one weekend
and I headed over to NACA at one of the
wind tunnels because interested in
aircraft and all and in the wind tunnel
was what I described as a flying saucer
there was no doubt about the form of the
craft that was there 30 25 35 feet in
diameter probably four or five feet in
depth and thickness but then it just
tapered down on the ends but I got as
close to it as maybe ten feet and it was
on a pedestal that was prompt up and I
thought that is a strange craft and this
is before the UFO interest began
developing but this had been brought
back from Germany and it was in the wind
tunnel my curiosity was you know how is
this maneuvered though one section of
the of the slant had a plexiglass canopy
over it and from what I was told whoever
was the pilot would lie down prone and
fly this craft from a prone position and
the plastic was over the edge of the
flying saucer and I could said you know
average average pilot could get in as to
how it was propelled I don&#39;t know I
don&#39;t remember seeing exhausts there
were no propellers you know it wasn&#39;t
one of those lighter than air craft by
any means there was no visible means of
propulsion so I always took a camera
with me whenever I went up and this one
particular afternoon I&#39;ve been up
probably a half an hour and I monitor
the airport and the tower to make sure
that you know I was not getting in
anybody&#39;s way I usually flew it around
2,000 feet because it&#39;s legal minimums
overpopulated
means and I happen to catch its
transmission from the tower and I don&#39;t
know who he was talking to didn&#39;t talk
to me to take it really but I I
monitored it and so there was a
disc-shaped object coming in from the
west and and i thought well it&#39;s a
pretty good opportunity he&#39;ll take a
look and see if I could see it and I I
guess now if I would estimate altitude
somewhere probably not less than fifty
thousand feet and on up so I call the
tower after they were making people
alert of what was coming over over the
area and the tower said you know what do
you want to do and I see if you don&#39;t
mind would you release me from mm let me
go to 12 which was my you know my
maximum altitude without oxygen and they
said go right ahead and it took me
several minutes to climb from 2 to 12
and I got up and about that time this
silver ball was passing over and I took
a number of shots on 35 millimeter film
as it was going over and next I knew it
was gone and after I got down I asked
what happened and they said well they
had alerted the fighters at Langley to
go up and take a look at what it was and
by the time they could get scrambled and
get in the air and get to that altitude
it&#39;s gone since I was working at a
station that was owned by the newspaper
I felt free to go the newspaper into the
photo lab and I said let&#39;s I&#39;m really
curious as to what we&#39;ve got here and if
you don&#39;t mind let&#39;s develop this film
right now so gave it to the photographer
in charge it was a friend he developed
it and it you can see the silver ball in
the picture and I said well let&#39;s you
know let&#39;s carry a little bit further if
you don&#39;t mind let&#39;s magnify this let&#39;s
blow it up and finally we blew it up I
don&#39;t know how many times we blew it up
until we got to the point where the
silver ball filled the whole frame of an
8 by 10 it was fuzzy but but it was
it was a magnification of what we had
just taken and after we magnified it
wasn&#39;t a circular ball anymore it was a
football shaped object more like a
cigar-shaped object it came to two
points on either end I didn&#39;t make it
known to anybody but somehow somebody
knew I had it and I got a call probably
about six eight weeks later and they
said we&#39;re into this area of gathering
information on possible UFOs and here
and things like that and understand that
you take some pictures nor would you
mind loaning them to us so that we could
you know just take a look and you know I
didn&#39;t ask for credentials or anything
like that and I said well in addition to
pictures I also have kind of an
interesting collection of news items
that come over AP for the past in a 5-10
years even maybe not that long probably
five years and as we&#39;ll bring those
along we&#39;d like we&#39;re interested and we
like to look at that and they gave me an
address over in the fan district in
Richmond it was one of the older homes I
went in the man that had called me
introduced himself and said it real
grateful he bring these over you know
take good care of him get him back to
you and I&#39;m not didn&#39;t say who he was
with never identified himself and never
told me never told me who he was just
just to you know very very normal
the house is not furnished as though it
was a home it was very lightly furnished
there was an older home and didn&#39;t have
anything in it of any value as I recall
no antiques and no oriental rugs or
anything and in fact it was kind of
shabby and it it kind of made me curious
as to you know what he did and who else
was in the house but I turned it over to
him and I thought well I&#39;ll call me when
you finished or else I&#39;ll come back and
get it and he didn&#39;t call me for I don&#39;t
like two three weeks and I thought well
that&#39;s enough time
and since I didn&#39;t hear from him I
didn&#39;t have his telephone number I
thought I&#39;d going back to house and pick
it up well back to the house in the
house it&#39;s empty
it was nobody there I have no idea who
the person was I was very naughty heated
and more so because I didn&#39;t keep a
negative on it
and I didn&#39;t keep a print these these
were original things that I had and the
newspaper didn&#39;t keep a copy either
because when we did that we were just
doing it for our own interest it wasn&#39;t
for print or publication and they
disappeared from my life forever it was
it was large enough for me to see it
from from many many miles away and this
is a clear day I think it was like an
evening in June or July when the weather
was was very tranquil and the the
direction of flight was just so direct
that there was no floating around it it
had a course and it was sticking
directly to it whatever it was I could
see it but but it was above the horizon
so it could have been at least a hundred
miles or more away and it was over me
from the time I go to two to twelve
thousand feet and by the time I got up
there before the Jets could scramble and
get in the air it was going
Bobby who have had experiences and for a
while there seemed to be a concerted
effort to ridicule whoever it was it may
mention of anything it&#39;s like a lot of
things in life now disclosure is not
being ridiculed
went to the Pentagon for a job interview
the major that was interviewing me
brought up the subject had nothing to do
with whatever it said do you believe
with people who existed in that area
would have a closer relationship to God
than we do because of our limited
intelligence and insight and these
people obviously are far more advanced
than we are and I thought what I got to
do with what we&#39;re talking about I&#39;m an
oncoming here interviewing for a
military job and we just kind of left it
at that I yes obviously I think so and
we began talking about flying saucers
and I get the typical nebulous but not
evasive answers and one of the things he
interviewed and this goes back quite a
while there are certain things that do
remain in my memory very vividly and we
were talking about different aircraft
and UFOs and we were kind of blending a
subject in together very nicely and I
said you know what about aircraft in the
future of what what are they going to be
like and he said we have aircraft now he
said we we have vehicles or aircraft now
that we could actually fly but they are
so unique and so unorthodox not
conventional no you know I guess he&#39;s
referring to fact no rudder no tail no
wings or whatever that we just we don&#39;t
even bother putting him out because the
director of NASA at Langley I&#39;m trying
to date this to the best of my ability
around 56 and 57 something like that I
was stationed at Fort Knox Kentucky a
lot of the talk that went around Fort
Knox is of a p-51 that had scrambled
before I got there went up after an
object that had appeared on radar in the
tower and asked him to go up the p-51
went up began describing what he had
seen and then disappeared they never
found him
I don&#39;t know whether they found pieces
of the aircraft but I don&#39;t recall that
they even found pieces of the aircraft I
was at Fort Knox up until about 11
o&#39;clock one night and then got my car
and drove to Fort Campbell where I had
some collateral duties also got into
Fort Campbell about 1 o&#39;clock in the
morning there was a little diner that
stayed open all night and as I went to
the diner for coffee and donuts at night
before I went back to the barracks I
noticed it was pretty full and I know
that&#39;s kind of strange and the MPS were
in town and I said you know what&#39;s going
on had an air you know accident aircraft
down or something like that and know
everybody&#39;s really excited that a flying
saucer had landed behind a nearby farm
house and from bits and pieces I was
just trying to pull in as much as I
could and they said you can&#39;t get there
because they&#39;ve got it cordoned off the
MPS had totally surrounded the property
and from what we&#39;ve gotten from the
scene at this point which is like one on
32 o&#39;clock in the morning was that this
flying saucer had landed the creatures
in the flying saucer had jumped over the
house and had landed in the front of the
house the people in the house were
frightened to death absolutely going
bananas one of them grabbed a shotgun
and as one of the creatures went up to
the front door to investigate he fired a
shotgun through the screen door
the people are the creatures from the
flying saucer decided this was not a
very good place to be
so they ran back out the jump pack over
the house went to the back where the
flying saucer was located and took often
disappeared MPs were there and I&#39;m sure
this isn&#39;t a military report somewhere
they were from Fort Campbell because
this is a nearest nearest base and the
ones that were outside were from the
base also so they were from Fort
Campbell because the State Police were
out there also so if we had to track
this it was in the Louisville
courier-journal and and with somebody
out there attempting to ridicule
everything that&#39;s done it makes it
difficult to to do a story and have a
credible reaction to it when somebody
else out there like politicians are
doing now trying to find fault with
precise words and any innuendos or
anything else so I think a lot of people
who choose stories now look at it I
think from a monetary point of view and
I think that some sort of an embargo
somewhere down the line that you don&#39;t
mention us let&#39;s just just pass on it
you
