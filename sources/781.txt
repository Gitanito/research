such works I was long interdicted ;
but, with that perverseness inherent

Vanity here stepped forward and
urged me on tovthe undertaking I
meditated ; all the creative powers
of imagination were immediately an
action; nor slept they.until;my plot
was fully formed, ;and I'forthwith
determined to write a ^Romance.; .
,■ Havingi thus introduced myself,
I .must offer some remarks; on .the
leading incidents ofthe story: a few
of which are partly founded on facts
recorded in history■;<as the siege:'of
Gibraltar,, in the reign of .Charles
III. of Spain, $c. $c. • 1
¿'In drawing the character of the
Queen of Spain, I found it neces­

while he bathed her pale cheeks with
his copiously-flowing tears.
The regret that accompanied the Mar-
eheza to the tomb, was as sincere as it
was universal. The charms and amiable
qualities of her mind and person had
rendered Her the admired and beloved
of every Heart; and, the last sad ce­
remony-concluded, that separated her
from his sight for ever, her inconsola­
ble lord retired to the solitude of a
remote'1apartment; where* for- several
weeks^he-indulged-his grieflfor the;loss
of so=excellent, so' idolized, a‘wife; and

Amid the mementos of forrhen happi­

of that?exemplary monarch, who, a prey
to, melancholy, had lately sunk to the
tomb of his beloved queen'; and Charles
of Naples, having ,succeeded to the
Spanish crown, evinced his affection and
respect for his brother, and his wisdom
and judgment as a prince, in bestowing
the same unlimited^fnendship and confi­
dence on the amiable’Don Alvaro, who,
by-his-father’s decease, became at the
same time Marcheze della- Vittona and
prime minister of Spain.
Charles was a valorous and enter­
prising prince, ¡and so strict an adherent
to ¡the Bourbon treaty, that his strenuous
support of it had nearly cost him the
entire forfeiture of his dominions, in the
north. At,tins momentous period, the
counsel and advice of his minister were
indispensable ; and the -Marchese, ever
mindful of the good of his¡country, now
unhesitatingly prepared for Bis*return to

soon diverted his thoughts from'their
usual course, and turned;them towards
an object of even greater, importance—
to subdue, if,, possible, the hostilities
then existing between England and.the
Spanishcolonies inAmerica.
A cessation was at length effected by
his wiser,andxj udicious administration,
and time and change of scene had now
mellowed his sorrows almost into ob­
livion, andenabled himtoreviewthe past
events with calmness and tranquillity.
At *this,period the little ^iola had

more famous for their exemplary piety

knowledge and. information, it may
easily <be supposed that, with a dispo­

docile, Sebastian made a rapid progress,
as creditable to their exertions as it was
to his own extraordinary talents.

from art, to form the virtuous man, and
the elegant' and accomplished courtier,,
was denied him; as >he grew up.his

Sebastian seldom visited at the con­
vent, though his earlier years were al­
most entirely spent at Vittoria—but
wheneverhe did,he was always admitted -
to a privilege that no other stranger of
his sex enjoyed, that of conversing in the
parlour with his sister, and frequently
with the princess, who hardly ever al­
lowed herselfto be separated from"Viola;
in his society she found an undefmable
something so exquisitely pleasing, that ,
though she found no difficulty in con­
cealing her feeling's, she was always
ready to weep at his departure. - r

started to bis eye, whose pensive glance
forbade the further obtrusion, of such

and thoughtful. •
His regiment lay in a town almost at
the base' of tlie Pyrenees, overhung by
thick, woods of:pine, fir, and mountain-
ash, beneath whose-solitary shades he
often wandered, indulging his melan­
choly undisturbed, and in its gloomy
retirement, sighing forth his ¿passion to
the passing breeze, as if to waft them
to his adored Elvira. „

bastian’s future destiny—at least Osmm
placed so implicit'a reliance on what
they had foretold, that he now*thought it
incumbent onhim to apprize him at once
of all1that,fate had threatened, hoping
that the knowledge,of it would-put him
on his guard against many ills which
might-otherwise thappen to him. This

the fondness of a father, and even the
Marcheze was, scarcely more interested
in his welfare—accordingly, having first
consulted the Abad, and.gained his ap­
probation, lie determined to present to
Montalbanthe importantpacket thenext

The Conde had ever regarded Fran*

but in the latter there was something so
truly amiable and conciliating, that it
was impossible to "know and not love
him—
-all his affection was therefore
placed upon him that could be spared
from his own family, and that' did not

cess; and from their long intimacy and

felt less reluctance in performing the

by this firm reply, and the, conscious-»

was not to be hazarded; he therefore
listened in silence while his father in­
formed him that the King had ordered

He received the intelligence with in­
difference—he had lost the dear friend

hopeless and dangerous passion—mis­
fortune and unhappiness in almost every
shape hadbeen foretold to him, andthink­
ing it too probable that the prophecy
would be fulfilled, he cared not whither
he went, nor- whether he should ever
return, and almost wished that death,
which he was *>i>wabout to face, would

for awhile, and stationed herself amid
the Spanish armies, who elated with the
newly-risenprospect of victory, renewed
their exertions with redoubled vigour,
and for a short time anticipated a glori­
ous triumph. '
The ardour, however, with which they
pursued their operations, and the san­
guinehopes they entertained of conquest
and exulting in the overthrow of their
proud and powerful opponents, proved
m the end destructive to their hopes;
and the probability of success, which for
some time appeared to them was but
precursive to their final defeat.
Fortune once more declared in favour
of the English; and the scientific ar­
rangements, and cool policy and clever­
ness of GeneraLElliott, their commander,
promised to realize their now well-
grounded expectations.
Consternation and dismay disheart­
ened the assailants, and the Spanish
gourt speedily received intelligence of,
THE ASTROLOGER. 43
their discomfiture and the failure of their
plans; all the manœuvres of the Duc de
Crillon had proved abortive, and the
only chance that remained of regaining
the fortress lay in one mighty effort.
The King, after some deliberation, re­
solved to muster the whole military force
of the realm, and to repairat their head
himself to the scene of action ; where he
trusted that stimulated by his presence,
and encouraged by anticipating a victori­
ous result, they would at once annihi­
late the enemy, and obtain the long-con­
tested possession of Gibraltar.
Having immediately despatched a
strong reinforcement to Andalusia,
amongst which was Montalban’s regi­
ment, and made all .the necessary
preparations, he told the Queen that-
he should depart in a few days; ad­

The Queen was, still in the prime of
youthland beauty; in the formation -of
her] person, nature had done much to
complete;its loveliness; but had unhap­
pily neglected the more durable quali­
ties of the heart. She was a woman of
strong, and,..in many, instances, ungo­
vernable passions; -impatientof control,
emulous o f1admiration, and a perfect
Machiaveliail in;the attainment of any
favourite object, ' equally regardless
whether virtue or vice opposed. her.—
She-loved the' King ^because * he was
really handsome, accomplished, and
elegant,. not-because Virtue and good­
ness formed hie character; but her love
was that ‘sort. of. sentiment' slie could
have felt ¡at the same time for any one
else possessed ofithb same attractions;
yet1so inthralled was the Unsuspicious
Charles by her- artful blandishments,

and such was the ascendency her fasci­
nating exterior had gamed over; him,
that he had ever bestowed on her his un­
divided affection; and the,idea that it
was reciprocal, afforded him the hap­
piest hours; of his life. > ■
To leave her even on an occasion so
urgent ¡as the present-was, therefore, a
sacrifice to:which the loss: of his whole
kingdom seemed almost preferable. She
' joined in his enthusiastic hopes; she
perceived her advantage, and pursued
it, and it was finally determined that she
should accompany him. • *
The thundering dm of cannons and
every weapon of war hailed their arrival
at Gibraltar, on the memorable113th of
September, the day of the grand at­
tack. Showers ofshots and shells every
moment pierced through- the clouds of
smoke that darkened the air; four hun­
dred pieces of the heaviest artillery vig­

garrison appeared like a vast globe of
fire, from the volumes of flaming balls,
poured down from every quarter of it on
the enemy's ships
The ensuing evening decided the bat­
tle ; several of the vessels had taken fire,,
and blazed with tremendous and uncon­
querable fury ; thousands of rockets
flew through the illuminated atmosphere
as signals of distress. Rage, malignity,
disappointment, and wounded pride
were pictured in the blackest characters
on most of the countenances of the dis­
appointed Spaniards ; the eventful blow
had been given to their hopes, and Eng­
land had proudly wrested the fortress
from their aspiring ambition and unjust
claims.* .
The recent continued successes of the
English had, in some measure, prepared
the king for this defeat, notwithstanding

and skill of his own naval andr military
powers; and with dignified .composure

he retired from the dreadful scene, to
seek a solace for his losses in the tender
endearments of his royal consort.
On the following day their majesties
were -visited by the Marcheze della Vit­
toria, whohad come to consult them re­
lative to a treaty of peace, which had on
that morning been proposed by the
British General, and which the King,
under so many advantages that would
accrue from it to himself, deemed it
politic to accept. ,
A young officer of high rank in the
army had been the General's Ambassa­
dor tothe hotel of the Marcheze, and
preliminaries being now settled between
the King and his Minister, he was im­
mediately summoned into the royal pre­
sence, to receive the answer which the
wary Charles had dictated.
The Queen had previously withdrawn
to another apartment, ,attended by her
inseparable confidante, Donna Olivia del
Zorio; and seating herself at one of the
48 THE ASTROLOGER
balconies, "her*attention was attracted
by the-appearance*of Colonel Mortimer
below, who had just alighted from his
carnage; Never before, even amidthe
innumerable charms that dazzled the eye
throughout the Spanish court, had she
beheld a face and form so-elegant, so
interesting,- so beautiful. Instantane­
ously an'undefinable sensation, such as
she had never felt before, glowed in her
bosom,' and mounted in feverish colours
to her cheek; a volume of a favourite
poet she had opened dropped disre­
garded from.:her« hand p and; pleading a

arose and left the room, requesting
Donna Olivia to-remain. - *

gliding, swiftly *along, to avoid being
seen; from.which it was evident she:had
secreted /herself in the corridor which
overlooked the gallery on one side, for
the purppse of seeing whither the Queen
went, and that she had witnessed her
embarrassment in the gallery, and .sus­
pected the cause of her going there, she
could hardly doubt. „
Donna Olivia was a woman of no
common stamp, for many of her latter
years had been passed m the service of
the Queen. There, was m her features

something bold and commanding, which
appeared intended by nature to exact
the homage of all who beheld her; but
unfortunately, in her disposition were
blended so(many of the less, amiable,
not to say, disagreeable qualities, as to
completely refute that-idea.
She had been brought up at court,
under the care of her mother, who was
one of the Queen’s attendants, and who

pending on her majesty’s promise of
providing for her: low artifice, cunning
and deceit, formed her disposition; and
these; increasing with every succeed­
ing year, rendered her a very fit person
to supply the place of her mother, sub­
servient as she was to all the designs of
her royal mistress, whether good or evil.
Without appearing to have detected
her, the Queen entered arrayed in smiles,-
and to her inquiries, ‘“ whether she was
quite recovered,” replied in a ‘tone of
sweetness and affability which she sel-^
dom chose to assume towards aninferior,
and taking up her1lute/she presented
it with ‘the most"condescending fami-1

time requesting her to sing a beauti­

“ Let me see,” said Robert-emphati­
cally; and laying his hand on his fore­
head, “ I''have it; now you?re a tight
handsome lad, and as I take it, not over
rich nor grand no more than myself,
audif it’s thing that you’ve no more

me; I can match you in a trice; so speak
your mind at-once—to go, or not to go,

<
c Indeed, my friend, I know not how
to thank you,” returned Olivia, smiling
at his honest simplicity, C
i as to going
to service ; in a word, I ’d go to old Nick
to get a sight of England.”
“ No, no; not so far neither,” resumed
he, laughing heartily at his wit,'** Eng­
land does not lie on the road from Spam

to hell.' »But come, now, master Don,
you must»not mind a bit of a joke.”
A .frown had certainly darkened
OliviaV countenance at this sally, but
his good-natured familiarity instantly
dispelled it; and, giving her a friendly
clap on the shoulder, “ Cheer up, »my
boy/' continued he, “ L have' hit on a
plan:that will suit you as neat as arnew

empty pride about you, as I said before;
and so now that we’re a little acquainted,
as»a body may say, my nameds Robert

“ Antonio dello Morviedo,” was the
reply.
“ You’ve enough of it, m all consci­

when her abrupt remarks and laconic
replies at length led to the subject, and
Robert, having exhausted every other
topic, conducted' her to his master’s
apartment, where, as they had expected,
they found the miniature.
After viewing it for some time with no
t
little interest, (for the sight of Colonel
Mortimer had made her feel what it ,wa^
to have a heart susceptible to the tender
passion,)she hastily drew out theQueen s
letter, and, replacing the picture care­
fully, she concealed it under it, unob­
served by Robert, who, fearing that his
master might find them there, hurried
her down, and, without questioning her4
willingness to leave her place at court,
he said he would speak to the colonel on
the following day about hiring her,jand
requested her to call at an early hour,
when he hoped to have a favourable an­
swer. ' ,,
Having thus far executed ¡her com-
THE, ASTROLOGER. 83
mission, she appointed a time for call­
ing, when she had previously informed
herself that Mortimer would be absent.
Elated with success, and anticipating
the approving smiles of the Queen, she
took her leave of the good-natured
Robert, and, promising to be punctual
next day, she returned with the same
$ecresy to the Palazzo.

still more reflect how ardent, how sin­

which thus leads a /emale to lay aside

When his valet came next morning to
awake him* his first questionwas in,what
manner had a ¡stranger gamed ¡admit­
tance -to, his chamber the day,before,
remaining silent*respecting the letter.
Robert was ■above, ^dissimulation or
i
quibbling, and ¡attributing the¡discovery
to the picture’s having been misplaced,
iie gave a full account of his meeting and
conversation with the supposed Antonio,
without deviating; jfrom jor withholding
any:partiof the truth ; and concluded by
exhausting all his/,rhetoric to persuade
hismaster to takeT
Antonio to,England
with him, tCiSUpply the place of Durand
to¡Lord Charles.
, Mortimer, however, saw instantly
through the artifice, but forbore to make
any other*comment than applauding Ins
servant’s,candourbe therefore confided
the letter to his care, desiring himftogive
it to;the jstranger when he should call,
at the same time adding, that; he,had
already provided a servant for Lord
I'HE >ASTROLOGER* 91
Charles,- though^m fact, he had not re­
collected utitil now,any thing of that im­
portant commissionj-but he deemed- this
little breach of truth necessary-to pre­
vent suspicion from"arising in the mmd
of Robert, who took it'for granted that
the/purport, of the letter was sto lessen
Antonio’s .disappointment. -
This affair concluded, Mortimer re­
turned to fhis usual occupations, deter­
mined,to think no more of an occurrence
so common throughout the kingdom,
and which he attributed to the levity
of a Spanish lady of high rank, to ^whom
lie had been; introduced,; and who had
already thrown out many hints, of her
admiration of him. ' --1 . -,

but

probably have recoiled;from, > . «
Regardless of the effect her diabolical
scheme produced om Olivia;*the Queen
proceeded to inform- her that all the fo­
reigners•of rank were in a few days to
be present afran entertainment given by
his Majesty, and as Colonel Mortimer
would of course be included, his death
could easily be accomplished by.admi­

the fatal drug, to place it on afsalver, to
be presented to Mortimer.
In her usual habits Olivia-was vicious
and depraved, yet she was not exactly
the abandoned wretch the Queen-sup­
posed her to be, hnd;she felt her blood
chilled*at the:cool and deliberate man­

venture any further opposition,' and hav­
ing promised a ready compliance, •she
was glad to retire from the Queen’s pre­
sence, which had now growh more irk­
some and disagreeable-to her than ever.
In the solitude of:her chamber she
found as little to be pleased*with as the
society she had just quitted; Retire­
ment seldom had charms for her, as it
generally presented a long train'of re­
flections, which she would, if possible,

' The conviction that she was so com­
pletely the-creature,of the.Queen, was
now rendered.more agonizingby-the hor­
rid act she had beenenjoined to~to poi­
son Mortimer! She felt it-such, not only
because murder is a crime ofvso, atro­
cious a nature, but because Mortimer
was the fascinating being that ,he was.
HadJhe been less so, those compunctious
visitings of nature might have been.less
also;, nay, conscience might notrhave
been called into action at all. However,
- \ •
not to judge too harshly of her,,we will
only say, ¿that so far from intending,his
death,, she secretly determined to pre­
vent it, if it were possible to.do,so with­
out the,knowledge,ofher.Majesty,.whose
fears/for,her own safety she knew no­
thing but the assurancethat he no longer
existed could quiet; and who, should

sent Donna Olivia ;ta:make some^slight
excuse for■ her absence to the officiating
priest, she. hastened back to her apart­
ment, to give way to the storm of anger
that raged in her bosom. • , ' '
On Olivia's return she assailed her
with the bitterest reproaches for ■her
supposed perfidy— accusing her ofhav­
ing traitorously tried -to ‘ compass,her
death, in revealing a secret on the pre­
servation ofwhich herlife almost entirely
depended; and,now that it had been di­
vulged, ,certain destruction seemed ^to
awai&themboth. .
It was;long ère the repeated vows and
protestations of the Señora could con­
vince her that her suspicionswere unjust,
and. then the manner in which it could
have been foundout, and who or what the
stranger was, afforded a subject of pain­
ful conjecture : and death at the time
could hardly have been more dreadful
than their apprehensions ; in vain Olivia
returned to the spot where they had seen

though he might have visited

it was yet possible that his power over

returned to the abode of departed spirits,
whence they* trusted he, would revisit
earth no more, i
This circumstance, whether probable
or not, was, bymo. means sufficient to
dispel their alarms. To cut offMortimer,
would be undoubtedly followed by death

boasting of the manner in which he had

tion would at last discover her to be the
author of the letter,- she had little doubt,
though she considered not how unlikely
it was that without any clue, suspicion
durst glance at her *at all events nothing
more could be done at present, and what­
ever might5occur in consequence of >
her
indiscretion depended wholly on chance.
Too much the slave of- her passions,
and of a disposition too treacherous to
expect any real fidelity,, or friendship
from another, the Queen’s mind was not
at all at ease, so far as the secresy of the
transaction rested on Olivia; we are
ever distrustful ofour associates inguilt :
she knew the Señoratoo well to suppose
her capable of obeying any -suggestion
of honour, when out-balanced by the
more weighty' dictates of self-interest,

by a single advantage that might accrue
to herself, she would not scruple to be­

"O f your choosing! and^would you,

Montalban’s features fully displayed
his internal feelings ; and he retired as
soon‘as'he could, chagrined, and unde­
termined how to act. “ Can I forgive
myself,” cried1he, f* for cherishing a hope
so unlikely to be realized. ' Oh, Elvira!

ble and unattainable. Merciful powers!

forgotten our youthful friendship—our
mutual fondness? No, no, it cannot be,
—but my father!—there ’s the obstacle:
a mere trifle. Did not she tell me once
she loved me?— that was a jest; merely
hercliildish folly. When young, there
was a congeniality in our sentiments, so
sweet, so delightful!—0 God! O God ’
is it thou who whispers to me, *Sebas­
tian, go on and conquer’ ?—I will;,for
methinks I should not feel thus if my
heart were not instinctively led to at­
tach itself to her. Should I succeed—
there’s heaven in the thought!—not all
the love, duty, or respect, due to father
or king, shall prevent me from throwing
myself at her feet, avowing the sincerity
of my passion, and imploring her to be­
stow on me the right to be her future
protector.”

hear these fantasies no longér."
Sebastian felt confounded at this un­
usual austerity ; he made no effort to re­
press a tear which flowed down his
manly cheek, for it was the tear of con­
trition. MForgive,my lord this hasty en­
thusiasm; I will give way to it no more,1
said he as he took the Marcheze’s hand,
" hitherto obedience has had 'a prece­
dence in my filial duties, and shall it
now be wanting? Not so, thou best of
men ; thy will be done not mme.”
His father's warm and affectionate
t
pressure soon re-assured him. “ May
the powers above endue you with forti­
tude to keep this resolution, to combat
entirely so dangerous an attachment, to
banish Elvira from your mind for ever1”
Such was the ejaculation of the Mar-
THE ASTROLOGER* 131
cheze as he quitted the apartment, leav­
ing Montalban m a state of agitation not
easily described. How dreadful was the
alternative! hemust either renounce the
hope, delusive as it was, of obtaining
Elvira, or forfeit for ever his father’s
friendship.
In the midst of these reflections the
noise of a carnage rolling through the
court below reached his ear, intuitively
he moved towards the window, and
looking.out, his eyes met the full gaze of
Elvira’s, who was reclining in the car­
riage in which she and Viola were going
to take an airing.
His whole frame trembled, and his
violent emotion at first prevented him
from returning her salute.
" I don’t think Don Sebastian looks so
well to day as usual,” observed the
princess.

the idea of our approaching separation,”

Violaknew not how;to reply to this,
but though she hastily contrived to
change the subject, the princess saw
that she had too fully comprehended
her
THE ASTROLOGER. 133
Not less did Montalban' revolt from
the mandate that was to exile him from
the presence of his beloved; but a few
short weeks were to elapse ere his de­
parture for America, Oceans would
then separate them, and tear from his
bosom the last shadow of hope, for he
might neverreturn: the idea was agoniz­
ing beyond endurance, and m a fatal
moment of wild enthusiasm he made a
vow that no earthly power should com-
pel him to go. He determined .toresign
his commission, on the plea of ill-health,
and for Elvira's sake;to hazard the con­
sequences, be they what they might.
His resolves were generally unalter­
able; but the solemn oath had ¡passed
his lips, and to retract was now impos­
sible. It.behoved him, however, to dis­
semble for awhile, lest suspicion should
again revive in his father’s breast. The
Mareheze was about to visit the Castello
della Vittoria, to have it prepared for
the reception of the princess and Viola,
134 THE ASTROLOGER.
who had determined to make it their
abode for the0season, instead of the
Palazzadel Medina; and Sebastian knew
he should then be left at liberty to ar­
range his plans.
Meantime, from his emaciated appeal-
ance, Viola began to entertain serious
apprehensions for her brother’s safety ;
and she felt those combined feelings ot
censure and commiseration called forth,
which his situation was calculated to in­
spire. She now deemed it prudent to
seem to sanction his attachment to El­
vira; but, unaccustomed to dissimula­
tion, she found it a most painful task, as
other circumstances rendered it abso­
lutely, necessary, in order to avert the
danger she dreaded.
The,reader is, no doubt, already
aware of the impression Montalban had
made on the susceptible heart of the
lovely Elvira; though terror for her
situation compelled her to assume the
outward composure requisite to guard
THE ASTROLOGER* 135
against a discovery, her efforts were not
proof against the deep-searching eye of
Viola, who received her confession with
a coldness which more forcibly shewed
her the impropriety of indulging so hope­
less a passion*
Thus circumstanced, Viola perceived
all the difficulties she had to encounter,
—fearful that the part she was acting
should reach her father’s ears, who would
assuredly construe it into duplicity,—*
unwilling to offend the princess, to whom
she was so fondly attached,—and dread­
ing, that, to throw off the deception and
divulge it, would-overwhelm them all in
certain nun, she could only resolve to
go through the affair with as much cau­
tion as her duty to each party would
allow.
After an absence of three weeks, the
Marcheze returned to Madrid, on the
dayprevious to that on which Montalban
was recalled to Catalonia, whither he
136 THE ASTROLOGERS
prepared to go without throwing out the
slightest hint of his intention to quit the
army altogether.
Towards Viola, his. deportment had
for some time past been cool and re­
served, which she in vain tried to ac­
count for. The hour arrived when he
was tobid adieu tohis family andfriends;
still he received her parting embrace
with the same chilling formality, the
same distant coldness. He had at first
determined to withhold any explanation,
but, to have left her thus would have
been*a violence against his feelings, of
which-he was incapable.
He took her hand in his. “ Oh,Viola,”
said he, “ were it possible to diminish
the love I bear you, would not this an­
nihilate it ? You have blasted my every
hope. Elvira did, indeed, love me; and
yet you have destroyed all. But, read
this proof of your dissimulation; you
whocalled yourselfmyfriend—my sister.
THE ASTROLOGER. 137
’Tis in the princess’s hand-writing, and
was found on the floor by accident and
given to me.”
Viola took the paper and read in a
faltering voice the following lines:
f( Elvira l unhappy Elvira! wherefore
dost thou weep, or whence these rising
sighs ? Where is now the cheerful ani­
mation thy countenance once boasted ?
Ah! whither fled the roseate hueofhealth
and tranquillity from these pale and
languid cheeks ? How vanished from
thy bosom its innate happiness and
peace. Alas! to see thee thus meta­
morphosed! Let the stoic steel his breast
with stern philosophy,annihilatethe very
name of pity, and be more or less than
mortal, who could, unmoved, beholdthee
now! Oh love¡! thou tyrant ofthe soul,
hence! if these are thy pleasing feelings.
Sebastian! fatal, fatal sound, conveying
sweets to mine ear and poison to my
heart,—

happiness remained unshaken. Yes,

unblushing gaze of conscious rectitude
Assist me,now, to overcome the weak­
ness ofhumanity,and guide me oncemore
to that tranquil path from which expe­
rience ;has taught me the danger of de­
viating,”
Now,” resumed Montalbanyas she
folded up the paper and returned it to
him; “ now* have I received a proof
beyond denial of Elvira’s pre-existent
affection for me, and your ungenerous
and unjustifiable conduct; but hear me,
Viola, my fraternal love shall ever be
bestowed on you, and of this circum­
stance I.»will cease to think; my pur­
pose is,,however, fixed and unalterable,
and if. attempted to be marred by you

to one I have never seen, much less
made, choice of: Jet:him take care; but
this is a mere shadow, I am going far,
far away, and may never see you more.
Now, Viola, promise to comply with my
last request: let not a word of this con­
versation ever escape your lips; on your
secresy my very life depends ; if you
betray me you lose me for ever.”
Viola could no longer conceal her agi­
tation, and as he pronounced; his farewell
the tears streamed copiously on hi^
hand, which with sisterly warmth she
pressed to cher lips. The loss of her
brother, even for a few months, was to
-her affectionate heart a pang it had never
experienced: but for ever ! the thought
was maddening; and despairinglythrow­
ing herself on his bosom, .“ Oh, my
brother, my beloved Sebastian,’* cried
she, " you must not leave me; have you
no pretext for remaining in Spain; say
you are ill—are—in short, say any thing
—but do not; do notgo.”
140 THE ASTROLOGER.
“ Yes,” replied Sebastian, “ there is
one alternative; make me the promise I
request and our separation shall be but a
short one; say only that you will not
divulge what has passed, norwhat I shall
now impart to you; and I quit not the
kingdom.”
“ Never, never 1? Viola joyfully ex­
claimed, pressing his hand more fer­
vently than before u in presence of our
awful and invincible Judge, I solemnly
bind myself to secresy.”
u Then hear my decision and oppose
it not; as soon as i reach! Catalonia, I
will;throw up my commission. The de­
licate state of my health will furnish a
plausible cause, without allowing- room
for suspicions of my real motives, or an
appearance of ingratitude towards the
King.” .
“ But, Sebastian, will not your name
your honour,.suffer for it ? do you thus
sacrifice these to a foolish passion, or
even to vour sister’s tears ; oh no, in-

deed when I implored you to stay I
meant it not on these terms ; I knew
not what I said.”
“ Every thing but salvation would Ï
freely sacrifice to obtain Elvira. Viola
you know me resolute—but I thank you
even for your objections ; my honour and
my life are equally dear to you, and be
assured that neither ofthem shall suffer:
I must away, and when you least ex­
pect me you shall see me again.”
On joining his regiment, he found little
difficulty in persuading his commander
into the belief that a voyage to America
would prove detrimental to him; and
the latter immediately wrote to the
Marcheze della Vittoria, advising that
his son should quit,the service and re­
pair to the south of France for a few
months, in order to recover his health by
the salubrious air of that delightful cli­
mate. ,
The M&rcheze remonstrated on what
he deemed so absurd and unnecessary,
142 THE ASTROLOGER
and offered every'argument he could
devisej against it;' but m vain. Montal-
"d>an had so much ascendency over the
general, that the latter persevered inhis
applications until at last the 'Marcheze
reluctantly gave his consent,-little sus­
pecting thereal nature of Sebastian's dis­
order. r
It was accordingly settled that Mon-
talban should remain in Catalonia until
the embarkation of the1regiment, and
afterwards return to Madrid, to make
preparations for his journey over the
Pyrénées. - > !
The princess had now accompanied
Viola to the Gastello della Vittoria, and
the Marchese saw nothing to apprehend
from Sebastian’s return'to court/ on the
contrary, he' wished* to accelerate it,
having his immediate marriage in con­
templation, as! we have“before‘ stated,

THE ASTROLOGER. 143
The reader will be not a little sur­
prised to hear that the one he had de­
termined to unite the amiable Montalban
to, was:no less a personage than Donna
Olivia del Zorio,
So far.it had been planned under the
influence;of the Queen; whom the Mar­
ches was too fearful of disobliging, and
too eager to gain for his son so:splendid
anestablishment, to hesitate in obeying-;
and at the instance of her. Majesty, and
the request of the delighted Donna Oli­
via, he communicated to Sebastian his
views for him, in a long and eloquent
letter. >
It would be (difficult to determine
whether;Montalban, on perusing it, was
more „thunderstruck at the proposal it
contained, or terrified at the idea of
what might be the1result; for-he .had
discernment enough to .perceive that his
father’s motives were,not wholly disin­

other circumstances, aware; but that
she had meditated such a blow as this—
that his father could have approved of
such a woman fora daughter, lie had not
before entertained the slightest idea, of.
That certain ruin must accrue to him
were he to reject the deep-plodding,
vindictive Olivia, appeared obvious in
her having intimated to his father her
suspicions relative to him and Elvira,
and made him fully aware how much
she had them all in her power.
To obviate the threatened danger re­
quired, in.the opinion of the Marchese, a
comparatively trifling sacrifice; that of
bestowing his son on a woman of im­
mense fortune, and the bosom favourite
mi
of the queen; but she was one whom,
while he feared he found it, impossible to
esteem, and necessity rather than choice
compelled him to it.
On the whole, Sebastian deemed it
most prudent to seem to comply with
his father’s wishes; and, having written
THE ASTROLOGER. 145
back-a promise to that¡effect, it was by
mutual consent settled that the cere­
mony should take place oil his return
from Gascony.

fetch him an answer immediately, to
tell you the plain truth, I don’t half like
to go, ’tis so- black and so dismal.”
“ Tell me what passed between you,’’
said Viola, as she hastily glanced over
the paper. “ What did he say ?”
“ 'The whole story is this. Señora:—
I had some business in the village, and,
on my return home through the forest,
(which you know is the shortest way),
I perceived a man watching me; (holy
Virgin! how Í started). I forgot to tell
you it was close beside the convent.
Well, he thought, forsooth, that I be­
longed to the Castello; or he knew me i
’—I don’t know which—(its all the same
now.) However, he called to me to
stop, (and sure enough the fright made
hne stop;) so up he came, and put the
note into my hand, and .said, m such a
kind tone, *Well, good Bianca, how do
you do ?—Who is at the Castello now f

know I can always make free with
him;—”
“ For heaven’s sake, Bianca, tell me
at once what he said; a truce with the
rest for the present”
“ Wow, my dear Lady Viola, am I not
telling you as fast as I can.—Do you
think I can tell you in a single word?
Ah* my poor lady the Marcheza never
interrupted me this way; and I’m sure
I’d as soon hold my tongue as tell,a
thing by halves. Well,.as I was saying,
— 'Mother Saint Ursula!’ says I, 'who
could have thoughtof seeing you here,
my lord ?—I vow you have nearly terri­
fied me to death/ for he looked for all
the world like a robberpardon me,
Señora. ' Hush, Bianca/ says he, beck­
oning me into a more shady spot, ‘ you
must be as silent as the grave.1 ' Aye,

“ I will go to him myself,” said Viola,
“ 'and you must conduct me to where
he is; but, as you value my favour, you
must never mention a syllable of this to
mortal/’
Bianca, having pledged a promise of
secrecy, looked through the corridor to
be assured whether there was any chance
of their being observed, and both pro­
ceeded cautiously-down the staircase,
the bottom of which they had no sooner
readied, than a side-door flew open,
and the princess, in passing across the
vestibule, turned her eyes that way
and beheld them transfixed with con­
fusion.
Viola still held Sebastian’s letter in
her hand, and Elvira approached: with a
look of scutiny.and doubt, inquiring how
the Marcheze della Vittona was; adding

“ For shame, Bianca, to be so silly,”
said,the princess, affecting to believe
her ; “ but stay a moment,' Viola and I
will go part of the way ; the day tempts
me to a ¡ramble.” i- i«1 h ■
At „-this proposal Bianca,cast a silently
expressive look at Viola, who felt a t,a
loss for a=reply. ;She could not offer an
objection:; and, as- the princess was
hastening5to her apartment1 to adjust
her dress, Bianca said she must remain
behind, as the story about the monastery
was feigned ;•<she having been there m
the morning: “ but,” added she, ‘‘ if
your ladyship can get away for a-moment

Sebastian at therear of thenorth tower.”
With'these words she left her. Viola
not having heard what she said distinct­
ly, it having been5 uttered m a half
whisper, looked inquiringly* after'her
as if for a repetition; not aware that the
princess was withina few paces of them;
and Bianca at the top of tlie stairs; think­
ing her gone also, cried out—“ behindthe
north tower, Señora,” and disappeared
the next moment; while Elvira, with
mingled curiosity and fear, flew to her
chamber, not for thepurpose ofdressing,
but to consider how she could unravel
this mystery. 1
The north tower flanked one side of the
Gastello,' which for several years had
been uninhabited, and its1 interior was
nowin a state of ruin; which, combined
with the frightful reports superstition
had raised of it; would have appalled'the
most intrepid. •’ 11 - :^

where silence and darkness had so long
reigned undisturbed. ^
K i
She had got a large mantle to throw
over her as a disguise, in case of her
being observed, and was about to,excuse
hprself from accompanying Viola, when
the latter .entered, saying that Jiianca
had gone to the convent by herself, and
that she would retire, therefore, to take
a little repose, as the heat ofa
the day
had.made her langiud and unwell. , •
THE ASTROLOGER, 159
The princess conceivingthatthiswould
afford her a more favourable opportunity,
did not oppose it, and taking up a book
she said she would amuse ¡herselfiwith.it
until dinner-time: for a few minutes she
appeared to be attentively perusing it ;
but as soon as Viola had departed she
threw it aside, and descended to the
vaults, . ^ t
In one hand she held a light, and with

j At any other time she would have

but she now’ paid no attention to those
mementos of mortality, and, disinclined
to contemplation of such a nature, she
eagerly made her way to a large Gothic

Montalban and Viola amongst the trees
beneath, and Bianca standing at a short
distance from them, who instantly calight
her ardent gaze, and exclaimed in aVoice
of terror, “ Santa Maria, there’s the

Viola precipitately fled ; Bianca fol­
lowed; and Montalban stood with his
eyes rivetted on Elvira, who seemed in­
capable of moving, as if she doubted the
evidence of her senses, that Sebastian

“ I conjure you to grant me this re­
quest— this single favour,’’ said Mon-
talban; (t say that you will give me a
hearing—and where—refuse, and I go
hence forever.”
For some moments she hesitated, and
glanced fearfully around. “ Sebastian,
can you indeed wish me to deviate so
far from that strict propriety and deli­
cacy* my rank and sex render it so in­
cumbent on me to observe ? Yet stay,”
continued she, as he retreated a few
paces. “ Oh Montalban, I know you
honourable, and will fear nothing; be in
the garden under the western terrace
to-night at ten; I shall be there accom­
panied by your sister.”
“ You know me honourable, and yet
haverso little confidence m that honour
as to require her presence. The cold­
ness of her bosom will never make al­
lowances for the warmth of mine; she
is a stoic in those affairs*—she would
oppose all this—would prejudice you

against me, and render your heart as
insensible as her own.”
“ Prejudice me against you; no, Se­
bastian, to do that is not. m human—*
good God! J know not what I am say­
ing—the consciousness of doing wrong
m prolonging this conversation agitates
my whole frame. Adieu! adieu for the

hour appointed.”
“ Alone ?” demanded Sebastian,—
“ Alone,5’ she repeated, flinging down a
small key she had almost forgotten;
“ this will open the postern-door—till
then farewell !u
Her bosom throbbed with the most
violent sensations of fear and reproach,
as she slowly descended the broken
steps. She dreaded to trust herself
again in the darkness of the. long pas­
sages, which the glare of her lamp made
yet more horrid; and she blamed her­
self for having allowed curiosity so far
to govern her as to lead her into all the

-She listened for somebody’s approach
but the blast completely drowned every
other noise, and as she imagined nothing
could increase the horror of the present
moment,-she resolved at all hazards to
quit the tower, never to enter it again.
As she descended, a thousand dangers
presented themselves to her imagination
in the most frightful shapes; and she
was abbut.to stop in order to recover
herself,¡when suddenly the light re-ap­
peared on the wall beside her.
Like the coward grown desperate by
excess of danger, she now hastily ran
forward ; the tall figure of a man stood
before her, and with a loud scream, she
fell senseless into 1he arms of Rmaldo.

courage to enter it ; for as to my lord
Marcheze, whenever he went near it he
used to tremble even at seeing the owls
flying out of their nests of ivy on the
battlements. But I was going to tell
you, as I was walking slowly near the
rampart, thinking of the days of old,
when I too fought the battles of my
country, methoughfc I saw a distant glim­

consider whether it was a being ghostly
or bodily that carried it, I repaired
thither speedily; and(God preserve us!)
who should I find there but the princess;
and what brought her there is not for
me to know.”
“ Ha, here comes an express from

withdraw, Sonora, and I will send in
the letters.
Viola accordingly went 'back to the
princess, and in a few minutes a packet
was brought, containing two letters, one
for her and the other for Elvira.'
The first few lines of the princess’s
seemed to surprise her, her countenance
gradually changed— “ No, I never will
consent to this,” cried she; “ no power
on earth shall force me to it;” and she
threw the letter on jthe table, for Viola’s
perusal.
It was from the King, stating his in­
tention of accompanying the Marcheze,
the Prince ^Orlando, and some other
nobles of the court, to the. Castello, m a
day or two ; and adding that Orlando
had demanded her in marriage, and was
about to receive the royal assent,.
“ And what is there in this to discom­
pose yorn-ihighness,” asked Viola,,“ your
marriage with a prince of his illustrious

birth and high expectations;must surely
be desirable.’*
■ “ Lady Viola, you appear to forget
the dignity of my birth; the unworthi­
ness of Orlandothe baseness of his
past Conduct'; the vow I have made
never to forget it. No, no, I never will
sacrifice my own happiness tothe private
interests of another. From my soul I
despise Orlando, and yon are eonscióus
of it ; and yet—oh, admirable policy ]
you would have me marry one' whose
very name I loathe.”
A blush in which conviction and em­
barrassmentwere visible, mantledViola’s
cheek, as thereproachful glance of the
princess rested on her; and an unusual
coolness existed between them for the
remainder of the day.
At night the trembling Elvira was
punctual to her appointment, and re­
paired to the garden Unaccompanied.—

' Bornin a country where superstition

passions of the human breast so awfidly

marked by a peculiar sadness and me­

at the Spanish court, wherediis: unbend*
ing pride made several enemies for him,
and produced a misunderstanding be­
tween him and the Infanta Elviraafter
which *a reconciliation ,was found im­
practicable; he sought revenge* butrpru-
dence and caution baffled his schemes,
and he cherished that demon of his coun­
try in his vindictive .bosom until another
visit to Madrid gave him an opportunity
of gratifying it to the fullest extent.
The Diuca del Marino (one of the no­
blemen of the court) had a son, -young,
handsome, amiable,, and: accomplished;
a paragon of almost every excellent qua­
lity combined ; the idol ?of, his.-father,
beloved.and¡respected by all who knew
him : every tongue resounded the virtues
of theMarcheze diBosalvajiwbo, at the
-age of twenty, was ushered "into the
.great,, world, amid the'plaudits of the
rich, and the blessings of the poor.

seemed impossible that they could ever
be united, she resolved to act according
to the dictates of her better reason,, and
lastemto the suit of the more high-born
Ferdinand; but weak and evanescent
-was such a resolve, and fate seemed
determined to oppose it.
Her attachmentto Rosalva was pub­
licly talked of, and met universal appro­
bation; and;the Duca, who was ofroyal
extraction, arrogant and ambitious, per­
ceived and encouraged his son in his
affection for her, vainly hoping that his
posterity should one day ascend the
throne. It was not, of course, unob­
served by the King, who, guided by
the advice of his minister, and speculat­
ing on marrying Lmdamira to Orlando,
did not.long withhold his consent,to-the
union-of Ferdinand and: Elvira.

love return for Montalban, for the only

With avidity Orlando seized this op­

spirit,of vengeance, which had,dong
raged within him, and. murmured at

was..of a temper, dark, designing, and

the plot laid between Orlando and Lin-
damira, and promised to take the ma­
nagement of it upon herself, a proposal
they did not hesitate to agree to, with
the proviso that she should use all her
influence to alter his affection in favour
of the latter.
She saw that this was an affair which
required the utmost cleverness and cau­
tion to carry her safely through: aware
that should it come to the knowledge of
the King, the most terrible consequences
would ensue ; even from the Queen it
was therefore necessary to conceal it,
and whilst she daily scmght her opportu­
nity, she kept a strict watch over all her
words and actions.
In ElviraV absence Ferdinand's visits
to the Palazzo were less frequent; and
consequently, Donna Olivia's object, to
obtain an interview with him, was very
difficult.
The long interval of suspense and ex­
pectation, gave her time to reflect on
THE ASTIiOLOQEB. 211
the danger: of what she was about to do*
She panted for vengeance, yet trembled
to think what the event might be to her­
self, whether her attempt should suc­
ceed or fail y and the fear of such a
punishment as the crime deserved over­
coming every other sensation, she re­
solved to make Orlando the instrument
of her treachery, and found in him a
willing votary to her demoniac plans.
This Prince and the Marcheze had
contracted a firm intimacy, and had now
become almost inseparable: the poison
intended for his ears was, therefore,
more easily conveyed, and less liable to
detection m the shape offriendship.
He began by a few cursory remarks
on the intended nuptials, commented
on the beauty of Elvira, but largely ex­
patiated on the nobler beauties, and still
more exalted virtues of her sister; with
whom, he added, political motives en­
tirely forbade his marriage, Elvira was.

on art affair of -great importance, which

could not;be: avoided. He delayed, how­
ever, untilthe princess was pronounced
out of danger, and promised to use the
utmost despatch.
The Duca was at this period confined
to his ¡chamber b y'a fit of the gout,
which the business thatihad summoned
his son to Italy by no means tended to
allay. • . f:
The failure'of a Florentine merchant,
in whose thands a large portion of his
property, was invested, threatened the
almost entire, destruction of the Dnca’s
fortune and estate near that city; but
when;a statute of bankruptcy was de­
clared, it was discovered that Signor
Barozzi had been guilty of some fraudu­
lent practices, which, leading to a-se­
vere. scrutiny,, the supposed bankrupt
was detected in time* to prevent his
emigrationuto America, laden with the
riches of several Italian nobles.

sat on his contracted brow, and death
was depicted in his pale visage as the

come by violent passions, he reeled
backwards and fell senseless on his bed.

danger of disregarding it. “ Beware,

awful tones still vibrated in his ear: the
idea of supernatural agency chilled him;
and appalled, he started from his revery

“ Betrayed me,” repeated Sebastian,

suddenly the spectral form receded, and
with a3look of reproach arid displeasure,

During thegreatest part of the ensuing
day Montalban confined himself to his
cell, as his fever had very much in­
creased. The Abad visited him fre­
quently, and offered up prayers for his
recovery: he was ignorant of the events
of the night; as \Ambrosio dreaded that
the knowledge of them would lead to
truths of himself, not quite consistent
\
with his reputation amongst the rest of
the.community. » ■ • 1 ■ '
It was now within a few days of the
eve of.their saint, and they were prepar­
ing for the celebration of the festival
with great pomp. Francisco, therefore,
wished to detain Montalban until it was
over; but the latter declared his .inten­
tion of departing immediately for Ma­
drid, which the Abad heard with the
sigh.ofregret, and a look expressive of
many sensations, a look that seemed in­
tended to.penetrate the deepest recesses
of Montalban’s bosom; but the-features
of the Gonde remained' unchanged,—

Sebastian turned aside to concealthe
anguish whichhisflowingtears betrayed.
He dashed away the drops,- which for a
moment seemed to unman him. “ Think
on my vow, dear and revered friend of
my bosom,*’ said he, as he seized’the
Abad’s hand and pressed it warmly.
They had now reached the-gate ofthe
monastery, which was opened-by Ansel-
mo, who held the Conde’s horse; which
had been kept in an old outhouse by;the
porter; and springing on:the saddle, he
bade the Abad a last farewell, and was
quickly out of sight.
He took not, however, the road to
Madrid, very different"at present were
his intentions. The deepening shadows
of twilight cast a dismal horror over the
scene, presageful of ill, and for a consi­
derable lime he traversed the outskirts
of the forest, ere lie had courage to enter
its gloomy mazes.

the grotto; the thick foliage of the trees,
^and ,the noxious weeds which grew
abundantly about it, declared it to have

peared; and/having fastened his horse
to a tree by a long string, which allowed
the animal to seek such sustenance as the
ground there afforded, he wrapt himsell

in his large travelling coat, and insen­
sible to danger, he entered the grotto,
and laying hishead upon a moss-covered
bench, sleep gradually' came on, and
shed a temporary oblivionover his cares.
The visions of the “foregoing day and
night disturbed him not; his repose was
serene and refreshing;, and at an early
hour*in*the morning he awoke consider­

D u r i n g the succeeding day the in­
disposition :of the princess continued un­
abated. But a composing draught ad­
ministered in the evening obtained for
her that rest her situation so much re­
quired; and in the morning a change
took place for the better. A settled
melancholy prevailed over her, which
not all the attentions of Viola could di­
vert; and on the arrival of the King it
increased, as he was accompanied by
Orlando amongst the others, who made
his obeisance in form to the lovely being
he already considered as his wife. ■

She received him with calm dignity:
her deportment was cold and reserved,
but totally devoid of any thing bordering
on rudeness; and seeing her unable yet
to bear the fatigue of conversation, they
left her to indulge her sorrows unre­
strained, and to fix on some plan to avoid
an union which would destroy her hap­
piness'on earth for ever.
From Viola she contrived to conceal
her griefs; her; generous; spirit revolted
from the idea.of imparting the infection
of woe to taint the happiness of another,
for her dear Viola was indeed happy,
nnd the joy 0$ her father on seeing her
so was only equalled by hers, and ex­

to it, in the most awful colours, all the

time he at; length descried them ; and
Orlando, asdfguided by his evil genius,
was foremost in the chase.
Suddenly' Montalban felt as if every
pulsation had ceased; as ifthe vital cur­
rent no longer flowed: he looked with
horrible, sensations.-on -the , dreadful
weapon; and the unfortunate Orlando,
unconscious of the fate thatawaited him,
now hastened on to his destruction. **

horse, and fled precipitately through the
wood ; from thence he'descended;into a
deep glen, which bore no! vestige of
having ever been centered before “ by

several intricate labyrinths ; and unhesi­

ously expecting the arrival of the
holy Father; who,,in his official robes,
shortly arrived, and bowing with reve­
rence, at the same time kissing a small
crucifix, which hung from his waist, he
took his station beside the table, on
which was laid every thing necessary
for the ceremony.
The piercing eye of the Conde, as he
surveyed him
. doubtfully, would have
thrown Father1Bertram completely off
his guard and betrayed the whole
scheme to Olivia, had not the Queen
(perceiving his embarrassment and Se­
bastian’s fears) instantly requested her
to withdraw with -her into amadjoining
apartment for a few moments, in order
(as she said) to allow-him to prepare
for his holy;,duties, but in,reality to
give Montalban an opportunity of being
,convinced .that the suspicions she read
in his looks, of treachery on her part
towards him, were totally groundless. ,

assumed, his confession to the Conde
plainly evinced. He had long "beenthe
abject creature of the Queen’s will, and
subservientto her authority;the devoted
minion of vice, no plot,,no undertaking,
however diabolical or difficult, seemed
beyond the compass of.his Machiavdlian
disposition and abilities to accomplish.
By the time that the Queen and Oli­
via returned,,the Conde diad prepared
himself to go tthrough the ceremony
with calm fortitude: his resolution was
not a little strengthened by the de­
portment of the latter, on whose fea­
tures sat a smile of proud exultation,
which but ill concealed their natural ex*
pression of cunning,,'artifice, and deceit.
He gazed at hei leproachfully, while
every 'remembrance of her hypocrisy
rushed to hisound, and flashed a look
of indignant;fire from his eyes, which
fully expressed his feelings of resent­
ment and disgust.

He dreaded the pursuit and avenging
arm of justice; the bleeding shade of
Orlando still seemed to hover round
him; stilFcried “ retribution!and he
had several times nearly betrayed him­
self* when suddenly the natural impulse
of self-preservation checked him; she
feared the vengeance of the Marcheze
della Vittona, when he should discover
the truth, as knowing the Queen so well,
she did not think it probable that.he
could remain long ignorant of it; and,'
aware of the resentment the Marcheze
would feel at his soms; marrying clan­
destinely, and the consequent contempt
and' censure it would draw on herself:
she communicated, her fears to Mont-
alban, and attributing kis to thesame
cause, it was deemed most essential to
their safety and security not to stop for
even one night until they should have
entered France.

beneath the grand.colonnade that inter­
sected the whole length of the chateau.
At one extremity of the enfilade
stood the chapel; whose interior was
strikingly rich and beautiful, from the
number of valuable donations presented
from time to time, by different kings,
whose names were all respectively af­
fixed.
A small door opened from the chan­
cel into the cloisters, to whose hallowed
retirement, few, except the ancients had
access, as it was a place almost entirely
appropriated to religious meditations.
Underneath this remote and solitary
spot, was situated the terror of every
member of the convent, but the Abbess;
who, to render it, if possible, more than
naturally dreadful to the unhappy vic­
tims of her malice and cruelty, signa­
lized it by the formidable appellation of
the Bastile.
It consisted of a long arcade of dark
and dreary vaults, to which the rays of
THE ASTROLOGER; 25
the sun.had never penetrated ; and along
whose damp walls, hung several instru­
ments of penance and mortification ;
from the centre arch was suspended a
small tripod lamp, whose faint glimmer­
ing served .merely to make “ darkness
visible and portrayed the most.terri­
fic shapes on the party-coloured walls,
through the interstices of which, the
wind constantly swept in tremendous
gusts ; and often on the shrill •blast of
midnight, was borne m solemn, and se­
pulchral vibrations the lonely cry of
youth and innocence, struggling against
the fetters of tyranny and oppression ;
and if the souls of the dead are permit­
ted to re-visit earth, often, hither re­
sorted the wandering spirit to hover
round the clay-cold tenement, that once
it had animated; to mourn its remains,
unhonoured by the tear of affection or
pity, or thelast friendly duties of iuter7
ment ;. within a few years, two lovely
young novices had here fallen sacrifices

„ Saint Marguerite’s convent was distin­

which they were put in force, and the
restrictions imposed on its inmates, who

vows. To those, who had .taken the
black veil, all intercourse and communi­

ture her real character, or,thetrue source

When she had made an end of her

bending on one knee, he called a solemn
witness to the sincerity ofhis intentions.'
Her bosom heaved with gratitude and
delight, while in sudden transport she
seized his hand, and pressed it ardently
to herlips; as they invoked the blessings
of Heaven on his undertaking. Almost
confident of success, she already began
to congratulate herself with the idea of
the revenge she was now bent on taking
onthe Queen of Spain, and also on the
unsuspecting Montalban; nor did they
in any degree, obliterate the indignities
she had received from the Abbess, to
whom she determined to prove for ever
an implacable enemy, and on whom she
vented the bitterest maledictions that
her rage could suggest.
An hour passed in arranging a plan
for her future safety, and it was finally
agreed that she should accompany the
chevalier to Anjou, where Monsieur St.
Aubre, his father, possessed a fine estate,
THE ASTROLOGER. 65
and who, he did not doubt, would re­
ceive her with paternal kindness, until
she could return, to her native country.
This wasjust what she wished, and as
the convent bell tolled eleven, and warn­
ed them of the lateness of the hour, she
put her arm inside his, and they pro­
ceeded together to the extremity of the
wood, while she anticipated all the plea­
sures of liberty, and exulted in the
thoughts of what the disappointment
and rage of the Abbess would be onfind­
ing she had thus outwitted her, and
effected her eseape.
St. Aubre had lodgings in the vicinity
of the convent, and there he knew he
should be able to procure horses on the
following morning to convey them to
Anjou; where he trusted his fair charge
would find a secure and' comfortable
asylum.' On seeing him approach ac­
companied by a female, Agatha, who
stood behind the portal with the massy
keys in her hand to open the gate,
66 THE ASTROLOGER
demanded in a voice of alarm, who she
was, and whither she was .going,— “ Let
this: satisfy you, good Agatha/’ said St.
Aubre, putting a small purse into her
willing .hand, “ make no further in­
quiries—^tis enough that J assure you
this lady'is not one of the sisterhood ;
but hasten to let us pass—delay may
be dangerous—and to me fatal ; at the
expiration of a week you shall'see me
here again. ”
“ May the holy "Virgin bless your
sweet face, Monsieur!" said Agatha
looking for the right key; “ 'but where
may.anyiof us be at the end of another
week?"
¥nu shall not be here at all events/’
said the hoarse voice of some person un­
s e e n d e a r l y shall you repent this

-“ G)li holy St, Marguerite, we are
discovered—‘ruined*—undone!” cried the
terrified porteress, dropping the bunch
of keys.
THE ¡ASTROLOGER. 67
Donna Olivia stood pale and motion­
less, while S t Aubr£ endeavoured to
force open the gate, and, with*a petrify­
ing look, the exasperated {Beatrice-burst
from the, thicket which ,had .concealed
her.
OhI profanation most horrible, most

J exclaimed she,, her whole
form iniiated with fury, “ a man within

via on the terrace ; and a suspicion of
her design prompted her to follow her
to the wood, where she had overheard
the whole of her conversation with St.
Aubrk, and made herself fully ac­
quainted with their, plan.
She had suffered them to reach the
gates in order to discover whether the
fidelity oftheporteresswas tobe shaken;
and she now vowed that' she would
make them feel the utmost severity of
their laws'; and continued those horror-
inspiring threats until they found them­
selves in the presence of the Abbess.
“ Well, daughter,31 demanded1the
latter, laying down the missal sh^ had
been reading, on the table, and assum­
ing move dignity of voice and manner
than could possibly be thought natural:
“ Well, daughter, what would you with
me at so late an hour? Hath this lady
committed any new offence, or, is there
any thing wrong in the dormitory? For,

rupt my retirement. ”
‘fI have not yet gone the round of the
dormitory, Madame ; but when you shall
have heard what I have to detail to you,
the omission will appear less culpa­
ble. ”
She now threw open the door to adr,
mit the other delinquents, and when they
had made their obeisance to the Abbess,
she gave an elaborate account of the
whole transaction, exaggerating every
part of dt, particularly the epithets
which Donna Olivia had made use of in
her threats of vengeance against her
ladyship.
“ Jesu M ane!” cried the Superior,
“ have mine ears ever heard impiety so
horrible as this1—dared the wretch de­
nounce such things towards a mother of

stantly from my sight, and let her be

chapter of all the nuns to award the

'With a look of exultation, Beatrice
called one of the lay-sisters who had not
yet retired to her cell, and desiring her
to conduct Olivia to'her destination, she
accompanied the affrighted Agatha' to
her prison; and, having secured the
newly-discovered door, so as to leave
no possibility of escaping through it,

she repaired to her own apartment to

D o n n a oiivia was now immured m
a narrow apartment, from which, on all'
sides the light was totally excluded; and
her situation seemed more dreadful
when she contrasted it with what she
fancied it would have been, had those
hopes been accomplished which so
lately she had cherished.
But now indeed hope was no more:—
the most dismal prospects arose before
her, and absorbed her m.a, state of de­

outside, which was presently afterwards
followed by a gentle knock at the door
of her prison, accompanied by the voice
of one of the sisters, which she recol­
lected to be that of Emmeline,
“ Be not alarmed, Señora-----—
said the amiable r/un, in a tone of con­
ciliating sweetness, as she cautiously
opened the door, and entered uninvited,
bearing a lamp m her hand—“ I am
come, not as your looks tell me you
suspect, an emissary from the Abbess,
but to offer you my friendship and to
request yours in return. I wish to
serve you—to preserve you from the ills
that cruelty and superstition are prepar­
ing for you—Heaven alone knows how
disinterested is that wish: and that no­
thing else could have tempted me to
run the risque I have done; for were
the Abbess, or the yet more inflexible
mother Beatrice, to find out that I left
my cell at such an hour as this, or that
I dared to approach or converse with
THE ASTROLOGER. 73
any one under the displeasure of the
Superior, the consequences .might per­
haps, be fatal to of both us.”
She now secured the door, having'as­
certained that there was nobody in the
gallery, and placing the lamp on a small
talile, she drew from beneath her lone
robe a little basket, containing some
fruit’ and other refreshments, which she
had by stratagem procured from the re­
fectory stores, and which she entreated
Olivia to partake of, as a pledge of that
friendshipshewished torenderreciprocal.
For the last two days, the latter had
taken very little sustenance, and she
partook sparingly of the delicacies which
the affectionate Emmeline had singled
out tor her , but the-fear of-artifice, and
distrust of the nun’s sincerity, kept her
stiir reserved ; experience had taught
her the dangers arising from confidence,
incautiouslybestowed; and ere shegrant­
ed'hers, she resolved to know the one
who sued far it. ■'

Empaeline had sat down beside her,
and taking her hand with a look of kind
sympathy, which at once declared the
purity'of her heart, and such as no effort
of art could put on, “ Ah, * continued
she, “ I plainly perceive by the cold­
ness of your manner towards me, that
the harsh and unfeeling treatment you
have experienced here, has rendered you
distrustful, even to the voice of friend­

aspersions of the Abbess do injustice to

" No my amiable friend,” said Olivia,

“ The lady Abbess hadexpected, that
within the space of three days you
would receive the veil, and render
t
any compulsory measures unnecessary,
nearly two of which are yet unexpired;
while you persevere m resistance, you
are amenable to any punishment the
Superior may think fit to inflict, in order
to enforce acquiescence; but afterwards
they cannot touch you, unless on some
gross violation of the rules; if, there­
fore, you would avoid the sufferings
THE ASTROLOGER* 87
menaced by our formidable tribunal,
you have one, and only one resource,
that of immediately consenting, to take
the vows of our order; and, at the same
time presenting the Abbess with part of
the sum you have received from the
Conde Montalban. Such donations we
appear to suppose, are appropriated to
the support of the convent, but: however
they may be applied, is a secret to all
but Beatrice ; and, as they are always
acceptable, they generally procure for
the donor (if considerable,) the cour­
teous smiles and favour of the, lady
Abbess.”
“ Most cheerfully shall I accept the
alternative,” Teplied Olivia, “ but mis­
take me not so far as to suppose thatJ
am influenced to it alone by dread of
the tyranny or power of the Abbess;
nothing can now be more congenial to
my soul than this holy retirement,’and
to-morrow I shall willingly pledge those
vows required of me.” :

Donna Olivia pressed her hand with
airthe warmth of gratitude, as she arose
to depart. 1“ Oood night, angelic>coun-
sellor;” she" whispered; “ the greatest
reward you can experience, for the-good
THE ASTROLOGER* 8 9
you have thus wrought, is indeed the
approbation of your own bosom; may
Heaven remunerate you with its richest
blessings hereafter,”
Having affectionately embraced her*
the good-natured nun at length with­
drew,* observing the same precautions
she had done;on entering; and, having
carefully replaced the key of Olivia’s
prison m its usual place of concealment
in the dormitory, which she had by
chance discovered, she retraced her way
to her cell. She now for the first time
considered, that it was probable she
had been missed by the mother Bea­
trice, but fortunately the latter had
either that night forgotten her usual
duties, ¡or from the lateness of tire hour
had concluded that the nuns were all
safe m their cells,, and consequently
thought her accustomed walk round the
dormitory not absolutely necessary. The
nun had left Olivia a small lamp, with a
strict injunction to extinguish it as soon

as she could fix herself so as to be able
to sleep comfortably through the night,
and this she promised to do; when
Emmeline had retired, she again took
up the CJondeV letter : u Noble exalted
being,” she exclaimed, as she glanced
over it, and the sum it contained, <
fwhat
a generous soul must thine be, which
can thus magnanimously bestow a fa­
vour on the one thou hadst such cause
to spurn and hate!” Throughout the
whole letter indeed, shone the goodness
of Montalban’s heart, and the- convic­
tion of how undeserving she had been
of this last piece of generosity, drew
from her the bitterest tears of remorse.
The enclosed draft was to a large
amount, and the gratification with which
she viewed it, arose chiefly from the
reflection that a part of it, appropriately
bestowed, might procure a dispensation
from the punishments preparing for her.
Knowing the mercenary disposition of
the Abbess, and, as her favours were ever
THE ‘
ASTHOrOGElt. 01
to be thus purchased, almost1confident
that if her voluntary consent1to take1the
veil shouldfail in exempting’ her-from the
sentence of the next day's convention,
such an offer would possess too many
temptations to be rejected ; and, if it
could not gain'her friendship; would at
least: tend -to make her future residence
'is the convent, as comfortable and tran­
quil as other circumstances vtfould allow.
Amid the various emotions that suc­
ceeded, sleep gradually approached with
drowsy steps, and breathed its oblivious
charms over the senses of Olivia, who
had, according to her promise, carefully
extinguished and concealed the lamp.
She- did not awake until roused next
morning by the shrill voice of Beatrice;
• i
who, bending over her with a malicious
grin; desired her to prepare to go with
her the parlour, which being exactly
what she wished; she hesitated not to
do. They found the Abbess1alone, and
attired in deep black, it being the'dress
92 THE ASTROLOGER,
always worn whenever a chapter of the
nuns was held. With a repulsive and
chilling frown she regarded Olivia for.a
moment, and dismissed Beatrice to su­
perintend for awhile the preparations
m the chapel.
The heavy sounding bell now began
to toll, and a sensation of sickening ap­
prehension suddenly seized Olivia, who,
losing all her presence of mind, and pale
with terror, sank on her knees,, unable
to articulate a word.
Beatrice had returned to say, that
most of the nuns were already assem­
bled, and the Superior bade her, in an
unfeeling voice, conduct the trembling
Olivia to the chapel; adding, “ that she
should follow as soon as the clock struck
twelve.5*
Olivia was now completely overcome
by her agitation; she tried to speak, but
the effort was vain; and, grasping the
arm of the Abbess, who approached her,
her piteous looks seemed to plead more
THE ASTROLOGER. 93
powerfully for her than words could
have done. For many minutes her fixed
and silent gaze arrested the attention of
the Superior, who, feeling its resistless
influence, endeavoured to withdraw her
hand. Still, however, Olivia retained
her hold; and, nearly choked with those
emotions which she had not yet given
vent to, a torrent of tears, which had
been long ready to gush forth, refused
further control, and appeared to have
softened the natural asperity of the
Abbess’s temper.
The sentiment of pity they inspired
was momentary; the latter deemed it
weakness, and fearful of being obliged
to yield to it, and encountering a re­
proachful glance from Beatrice, she sud­
denly tore herself from the grasp of the
kneeling suppliant; and, waving her
hand to Beatrice, bade her instantly
bear her thence
The dreadful command thrilled hor­
ribly through every nerve of the weep-

ing penitent, who, still denied the power
of utterance, shrunk appalled from the
advance of Beatrice, and, sobbing con­
vulsively, fell motionless on the floor
The Abbess again approached, and sup?
ported her in her arms. Olivia’s fears
were now raised to the highest pitch,
aqd? with a violent effort, she .tried to
speak.
“ Holy Mother, spare me I beseech
you,” she cried—“ if pity sways your
breast; and, oh! let this plead for me
if my tears cannot, and show how sin­
cere is my wish to atone for what is
past,” extending, as she spoke, Mon-
talban’s present.
“ rAtonemenM” repeated the Abbess,
joy and avarice, which she could not
conceal, giving animation to her fea­
tures; poor simpleton, think you that
l am ito be won by gold; that Tsell.my

repentance, and your taking -the veil

this very day; if such indeed be your
intentions, I accept this as a pledge,
and shall take care to apply it to the
benefit of the convent 5
” at the same
time without waiting to hear any other
conditions, she took the proffered sum*
and deposited it m her bureau.
,f Spare me, Lady, I repeat, fromfur­
ther persecution; lead me this moment
to the altar, and there I will yield my­
self a votary to my God and his holy
church.”
Beatrice bit her nether lip, and the
Superior regarded her in silence for a
few minutes, apparently considering
how she should reply. Are you aware,
daughter, of what you propose ?” She at
length interrogated; “ is this merely
the impulse of the moment, or do you
solemnly promise totake the veil ?”
“ Most solemnly, Madame; this very
instant I amprepared; nothing can now
be more consonant with ,my feelings ”
MYou are forgiven then,” resumed

4but beware of trifling with
me ; you should find it a dangerous
attempt; you may now remain, here
until the mother Beatrice and I shall

must repair, to sanction whatever sen­
tence may be passed on the wicked and
abandoned Agatha, and also to inform
the community of what you have agreed
to;” '
Olivia felt relieved by their absence ;
and taking up a small missal, she'con­
tinued absorbed in her devotional duties
until they returned.
It was settled that she should be pro­
fessed after the evening servicp; and
the whole sisterhood now retired to
prepare for the ceremony. " ’
After taking some refreshment; Olivia
withdrew to her cell, with sister. Emme­
line; who was allowed to accompany her;
where, joined by4he amiable him, she
spent an hour m fervent prayer, and fell
her spirits considerably lightened and

invigorated by it; her countenance
looked more cheerful and resigned than
it.had hitherto been; and she was able
to converse with her intelligent compa­
nion on several interesting subjects,
until the vesper bell summoned them to
the chapel.
The sacred edifice presented an ap­
pearance truly solemn and grand, the
walls were hung round with black cloth,
and the gilded pillars which supported
the arched roof, with the ornaments of
gold that decorated the whole interior*
formed a contrast with its deep sable
hue, which the eye could not behold
without admiration; from the centre of
the richly ornamented ceiling was sus­
pended a large chandelier of massy
gold, and another over the altar, in both
of which burned several wax-tapers,
that threw a radiant light around, al­
most surpassing m brilliancy the noon­
day sun.
It had been thus fitted up for the ap-

IN about two hours after the party had
left the Gastello ‘for the chaise, the tête-
à-tête of the Princess and Viola was
interrupted by the entrance of Bon
Malvoho de Cerberos; the intrusion
was as mal-à-propos as unexpected,
for he had been the subject of their con­
versation, and he was far from being
a favourite with either of the ladies.
To the Princess, in particular, he had
long been obnoxious ; his attentions had
ever been coldly repelled, but in his de-

portment towards her prevailed a de­
gree of unlicensed familiarity which
often alarmed her, and which her re­
pugnance to receive it rather tended to
increase.
Unawed by the undisguised and dig­
nified resentment she coukl not help
showing, and apparently unconscious of
his presumptuous folly, he had more than
once professed himself wa dy an ad­
mirer of her charms, and a candidate
for those affections which he took care
should at least not be bestowed on an­
other without his knowledge.
Ere increasing* years had matured
her judgment, these declarations ex­
cited no other sentiment than contempt
for their absurdity; and she laughed
with ¥iola at the lengths to which he
had ventured; the romantic ardour of
his passion, and the sanguine hopes he
seemed to cherish.
His manner had, however, lately as­
sumed a greater than usual degree of
f 4
104 THE ASTROLOGER.
boldness and confidence, which could
no longer be mistaken, and which had
almost terrified Elvira into a deter­
mination to represent his conduct to the
King; until advised by Viola to treat
him with indifference during their,stay
at Vittom, as her making it known
would disturb the harmony of the whole
party and possibly might be attended
with fatal consequences; but if on their
return to court he should still persist m
his addresses, it seemed the only method
of putting an end to them.
Her attachment to Viola, and unwil­
lingness to interrupt the happiness she
had promised herself m her union with
Don Manuel d’Orellez, rendered her
consent not to take notice of it at pre­
sent, easy to be obtained.
“ Senor!1* said Viola, rather sharply—
vexed at his intrusion, *
*this is an un­
looked-for visit—we thought you had
joined the hunters. ” This observation
evidently disconcerted lum—and, to
THE ASTROLOGER. 105
their surprise, he seemed to have lost
his usual undaunted air of self-con-
sequence.
<fSome letters of importance, which 1
had to writer detained me at the Gas­
tello,” replied he, addressing them both,
and at the same time taking a seat be ­
side the Princess; “ but surely it has
proved a fortunate detention, and com­
pensates me fully m affording me the
pleasure of your society.”
Compliments were ever fulsome and
unacceptable to them; but from the
Senor Malvolio they were, if possible,
more disagreeable than they would have
been from any body else; this therefore
they scarcely noticed. He now joined
m their common-place topics of conver­
sation ;, but there was an unusual re­
straint and embarrassment in his man­
ner, a dulness in his remarks, and an
indescribable fearfulness m his looks,
which they knew not how to account
f 5
106 THE ASTROLOGEK.
for, and' which he seemed unable to
divest himself of.
After sitting a considerable time, he
withdrew; and Viola, m a short time
afterwards, going through the-ante-room,
met Bianca, who had admitted him.
“ Bless me, my lady ’ ” observed the
latter, 4‘ how the proud Senor Malvolio
is changed to-day—he is so pale, and
trembles so, he looks for all-the world
as if he had seen a ghost * and truly I
warrant he lias; for there has he been
shut up these two hours in the old oak
parlour, at the far end of the vestibule,
that was my lord’s study and' I am
sure------”
“ Something has certainly happened
to discompose him, *
*interrupted Viola,
with a smile, fearful of talking of him,
least he might be within hearing; “ but
as this.is not the age of ghosts we must
attribute it to some more probable
cause. ’

with a significant emphasis, “ this very
day is, of all others, the eve of San Se­

for sometiine; but seeing Viola engaged
at a drawer near her—she began again
when she had wiped.them away.
“ Well, as I was saying* this day two

me a day of melancholy, from the re­

we lost the best of mothers—and all the
festivities here to celebrate their births

fort him—and the pious Osmin too—but

”
A tear now trickled slowly down
Viola’s cheek, and Bianca on perceiving
it, immediately checked herself, and
talked no more on this distressing sub­
ject until Viola returned to the Princess,
and then, m imagination, she went
through all those dismal scenes again.
Elvira was seated in a balcony, over-
THE ASTROLOGER. m
looking the lawn below, and Viola, with
her drawing materials, took a chairbeside
her; the eyes of the Princess were fixed
intently on the fine prospect her situation
commanded—when, suddenly, borne on
a litter, the body of Prince Orlando,
weltering m blood, to which the cada­
verous hue of his countenance formed
a contrast horrible to behold, was pre­
sented to her view, and with a scream
of terror and affright, she fell fainting
into the arms of her companion.
A conviction of the dreadful truth had
instantaneously struck her—and thefirst
sound her lips gave utterance to on hei
recovery} was the name of Montalban,
breathed forth m accents of agony and
despair.
Viola caught the word, and in wild
dismay, interrogated its doubtful mean­
ing. Elvira shook her head, and the
import of this tacit reply was too intelli­
gible tobe misunderstood. Viola stood
transfixed with horror, contemplating

the Princess—-and for some moments
she seemed deprived of every faculty*
until the door slowly opened, and
Bianca entered, with uplifted hands and
eyes,
“ Oh Santa Maria/' exclaimed she,
her alarm rendering her forgetful of all
ceremony in approaching the Princess,
whose cries had: hastily summoned her,

always done since my lord.Montalbans
birth; “ do, sweet lady, try to compose

Viola’s cheek grow suddenly paler than
before, and taking her passive hand,
“ you have not yet seen the bleeding
body, and;’tis best that you shouldnot”
*

cried the Princess wildly, and making
an effort to rise, 4
< the intelligence has
been a shock too violent for her to sup­

In amazement at her impatience,

nearly breathless with agitation, the
King rushed m at another, and in a few
words related the horrible circumstance,

produced such genera] consternation as
nearly to overthrow the whole.
Viola now awoke from the transient
insensibility into which she had fallen,
and as she was hastily retiring from the
room, lest her emotions should betray
the fatal secret of the suspicion she en­
tertained relative to her brother, she was
met at the door by the monk, who
having bestowed his benediction, ap­
proached the King, and told him all was
over, and Orlando had breathed his last.
Although this was what he had mo­
mentarily expected to hear, the certainty
of it suddenly overpowered him, and,
with a deep groan, he threw himself on
the couch beside his daughter, on whom
the Abad fixed a look so scrutinizing—so
full of suspicion—it seemed to penetrate
her soul—to read her every thought, and
she could no longer doubt the nature of
his conjectures.
A natural energy of mind and strength
of constitution supported her amid1all

the fears this gave rise to; and the
Kmg having" been led to his apartment,
Francisco freely communicated his sus­
picions, which she found corresponded
exactly with her own, for their hapless
object was Montalban. In quick suc­
cession he retraced m Ins mind all the
past events which had, alas! too faith­
fully fulfilled the prophecy of the long-
lost Osmin, Sebastian's fatal attach­
ment, and subsequent vow, the myste­
rious warning in the chapel, the dread­
ful performance of that vow that Orlando
and Elvira should never be united; he
shuddered at the retrospection, it seemed
at first like a terrific dream, but reason
soon convinced him of its reality. But
what a blow to the hopes of towering
ambition was Orlando’s fall, how de­
structive to all its visionary prospects;
in a moment all the sanguine anticipa­
tions, all the fondest wishes, the grandest
schemes of a monarch had been disap­
pointed, blasted, annihilated for ever ;
110 THE ASTROLOGER
the soul-rending conviction penetrated
deeply, and despair subdued almost
every other sentiment in the King’s
bosom.
With all her native dignity of cha­
racter and inward piety, Elvira calmly
reviewed the scene; the past, present*
and future are alike to the mind of con­
scious purity. To one earthly object
alone was her soul attached; and, even
on the guilty, the blood-stamed Mont-
alban (such is the invincible power ot
true love,) were her dearest affections
rivetted; still immutably her fond heart
retained its first, its lasting impression,
which no sophistical reasoning could
efface; and, (like water thrown spa­
ringly upon firevand thus tending only
to augment the flame,) all the arguments
and advice of the benevolent monk
served but to stimulate her love to re­
sistance, and evince the perverseness
of human nature. Her fortitude, how­
ever, was by no means stoical, nor the
THE ASTROLOGER. 117
magnanimity of her breast unmixed with
sensibility; she could pity the weak­
nesses of others, whilst she acknow­
ledged her own; could feel for their
misfortunes, whilst she censured their
errors, and compassionate their failings
and imperfections, whilst she condemned
their vices ; so regulated was her almost
unerring power of discriminating them.
Of a temper uniformly tranquil and
serene, the tear of sympathy never re­
fused to flow for the sorrows of another.
But, she could unmoved contemplate
the follies and vain pursuits that occupy
little mortals, her passions had ever
been under the guidance of reason, her
undertakings influenced by prudence
and foresight. But, where is to be
found the one in whose bosom reason,
prudence, and foresight, maintain their
empire beneath the despotism of love.
Alas, she, was unconscious that in its
overwhelming power all were swallowed
up, that before it every lesser sensation
118 THE ASTROLOGER,
vanished like chaff before the angry
wind; it was a rbaung and impetuous
torrent that with force resistless bore
down every obstacle. Yet Elvira knew
she loved, knew the dangers of it ; but
when that sentiment once implants itself
how- insignificant and contemptible ap­
pear dangers the most formidable,
obstacles the most unconquerable, hor­
rors the most appalling; all are mere
bugbears, that mock the resolves of
weaker minds, but love laughs them to

countenance, were scarcely inferior to
the more valuable and durable beauties
of her mmd; her figure was light and
exquisitely formed, uniting the airiness
of a Sylph to all the charms of the fabled
Venus. But there was a grandeur in her
deportment, mingled with an air of com­
placency and good nature, which com­
manded the respect, and secured the
esteem of all who knew her.
The death of Orlando, as a fellow-
creature, she would have lamented; but
the terrible circumstances of his un­
timely fate awakened every emotion of
pity and regret her gentle heart was
capable of feeling. Yet, amid the me­
lancholy and horror-inspiring reflections
it occasioned, there was still a some­
thing for which it was impossible to feel
the same degree of sorrow; she felt as

galling yoke her faculties and inclina­
tions had been denied, their usual, free-

gratitude to Heaven that the blow had
been by its will averted, which had so
long menaced the total destruction of
her happiness on earth.
To rejoice at an event so shocking as
Orlando’s murder, because it had freed
her from every apprehension and pos­
sibility of the evil happening to her
which she had so much feared, was
wholly incompatible with her virtuous
principles* her religious ideas, and moral
goodness; but the consciousness that it
had freed her, contributed to tranquil­
lize her spirits, until a thought more
dreadful in its probability than all the
rest/ suggested^ itself. Montalban must
surely have been his murderer; and, if
the dark and deep-searching eye of sus­

idea was almost maddening, and it re­
quired all the persuasive eloquence, all

intones not less wild than his manner,

frightened by the suddenness of the

the Princess, perfectly comprehending
the- meaning* of Bianca’s intelligent

would advise you to return to the sa­

The eloquence of the latter soon done
away with the doubts this question im­
plied ; and again requesting Elvira’s
pardon, he was atiast prevailed upon to
retire: and the Princess with noiseless
steps entered Viola’s chamber, and took
a seat by the side of the bed; where,
with her eyes fixed on her slumbering
friend, she gave way to a series of re­
flections of no very tranquillizing nature;
which were at intervals interrupted by
the wild starts and incoherent exclama­
tions ofViola.

With reluctance she obeyed1a sum­

cuse unavailing; they had already been
apprized below of Viola’s illness, and
consequently she was not expected ;
and Elvira desiring Bianca to remain
with her lady until her return, descend­
ed to the saloon.
(As she entered, Don Malvolio de Cer­

hand extended to' receive hers, whilst

two latter, absorbed m deep thought,
sat for a considerable time without dis­
turbing the general silence.
The King ate little, and talked still
less, and whenever he did reply to any
observations, it was in so abstracted a
manner, that he appeared unconscious of
what ht said.

ment were visible m his looks; the day

during the gloomy lapse ofthree months,

members; the melancholy ceremony
however accorded with .every feeling of
his heart, an heart which¡had never yet
lost its confidence m Heaven, nnr dared
to arraign its (to us) mysterious decrees,
and that confidence was >alone able to
support him through a trial so severe. ,
Without attracting the particular no­
tice of the King, Don Maivolio paid more
than usual attention, to the Princess
during the cheerless,repast; nor did he
betray the mortification he fell at-the
evident reluctance with which she re­
ceived .it.
Vanity was one of his inherent qua­

for his address was insinuating, and his

genius, as if envious of their power, had
early planted in his bosom the seeds of
malignityandvice, m so genial a soilthey
soon flourished, and grew to maturity
ere he had himself attained the age of
manhood. - -
Never had Elvira known moments so
full of misery as the present, indignation
and offended pride subdued for awhile
her efforts to speak ; and as soon as the
cloth was removed, she rose from the
table, and darting an indignant look at
Don Malvolio, who attempted to detain
her, she pleaded indisposition, and
hastened to the apartment of Viola, who
she found was still asleep.

could not restrain hei usual loquacity,

indulge it.

w s the vesper service at the monastery
of San Sebastian, and the monks and
nuns were chanting a solemn dirge for
Orlando's departed spirit. She ceased
to weep— Heaven alone seemed the
object of her regard, and involuntarily
she took up a lute which lay beside her,
and swept the trembling strings, whose
dulcet sounds were soon lost in the ex­
quisite melody of her voice.
Suddenly she checked herself; for,

rapt her, she had forgotten even Viola,

The. scene there was exactly calcu­
lated to excite those fears they had
been irymg to subdue* and they started
appalled at the gloomy sight. On a
large state bed lay the corpse in solemn
grandeur; the draperies were of nch
black velvet, With narrow borders, and
festoons of gold; lined inside with white

corresponding with the coverlid, which
was also edged with deep gold fringe.

put a sealed billet into the hands of the
Princess, which, upon opening* shefound
to contain a pressing invitation from the
Abadessa, for her and Viola to pass a
few weeks at the convent, until- the com­
motion caused by the, late disastrous
event should have in some measure sub­
sided.
Nothing could at present be more
consonant to her feelings than the tran­
quillity of that holy retirement, andfind­
ing it equally according with the inclina­
tions of Viola, and having obtained the
ready consent of the King and the Mar-
chesa, shewrote a few lines to the worthy
Abadessa, expressive of their gratitude,
and the gratification it would afford
them; and promising that she and her
friend would be at the convent oa the
day after the festival.
The monks now departed, and the
Princess and Viola after partaking of
some light refreshments, returned to

for society or conversation, and the
former equally fearful of again encoun­
tering the impertinent assiduities ofDon
Malvolio.
Although the night was now consi­
derably advanced, Elvira felt no inclina­
tion to sleep; and, having dismissed her
attendants, she was just preparing for
her accustomed religious duties, when
her attention was suddenly arrested by
the trampling of horses m the court be­
neath; and looking from the window, she
beheld a numerous-.train of vassals and
guards belonging to the Marcheze, who
immediately after Orlando's death, had
been despatched to explore the neigh­
bouring country in all directions m search
of the murderer ; but, ns has been al­
ready shewn, that search, although pro­
longed to so late an hour, was wholly un­
successful.
Offering up her prayers for the pre­
servation of Montalban, Elvira was
about to retire from the window, when

a bright gleam of moonshine fell full on
two forms m the court, discovering the
Abad and Don Malvoiio, apparently in
close conversation. Francisco had pro­
tracted his stay beyond the usual horn
for closing the gate,s of the monastery—
and surprise nvetted her to the spot foi
some moments—some secret impulse
independent of mere curiosity, (a quality
she had ever despised,) detained hei
there, for she fancied, (though she
scarcely knew why,) that she wa° the
subject of their conference, and she
deemed it not only pardonable, but in­
cumbent on her to listen to their dis­
course, and at once either have her sus­
picions confirmed or dispelled. The
wind had risen high withm the last houn
and her ear could only catch an indis­
tinct sentence at intervals between its
sullen murmurs, until a loud and angry
exclamation from the Abad, left her no
longer in doubt that she was indeed the
subject on which they spoke.

As he said the last words he waved
Ins hand in token of silence, and passed
through the portal, while the evidently
displeased Don Malvoho with downcast
eyes, slowly re-entered the Gastello; and
Elvira, agitated by what she had over­
heard, and almost confident cf the nature
of this Machiavel’s sentiments and de­
signs, endeavoured to lose for awhile
the apprehensions it gave rise to in
prayer.

Her mind was much more at ease on
the following morning, and the prospect
of again visiting the revered asylum of
her infancy, with her beloved Viola, im­
parted a degree ofcheerfulness, to which
the conviction that she should thus,
(though only for a short time,) be freed
from the sight of a being so hateful to
her as Don Malvolio, considerably added,
the pleasing anticipation of the affec­
tionate reception she should meet from
the Abadessa, her fond and maternal
embrace, and the friendly caresses with
which the whole sisterhood were wont
to hail her, rendered her almost forgetful
that any circumstances existed to make
her unhappy—and a smile of satisfaction
beamed sweetly over her features on
seeing that those expectations liad pro-

duced a similar effect on the spirits of
Viola.
About noon the Princess repaired to
her apartment, m order to get the few
articles ready which she intended totake
with her to the convent : having done
so, she took down from a small library a
volume of Petrarch, and, absorbed m
his pathetic beauties, she heeded not the
elapse of time, until the sound of an
approaching footstep m the gallery with­
drew her attention, and the next moment
some person tapped gently at the door
Supposing it to be Viola, she instantly
rose and opened it, when, to her un­
speakable astonishment and indignation,
Don Malvolio stood before her; who,
reddening with the confusion her angry
and repulsive frown threw him into,
entered, and, faltering out a sort of
apology for his intrusion, uninvited took
a seat. ,
This gross violation of the respect due
THE ASTROLOGER. 151
to her rank and sex, seemed to have de­
prived her for some time of the power of
expressing her resentment and offended
pride, otherwise than by the petrifying
look with which she regarded him. In
her every feature were seen the emotions
of horror and resentment that struggled
for utterance.
At length, assuming as much compo­
sure as it was possible to do, she demand­
edfor what purpose he had thus infringed
decorum, and the respect he owed her,
so basely as to intrude upon her retire­
ment, and unbidden, enter her presence,
even in her chamber.
All her dignity of voice and manner
was lost upon him, lie now threw off all
reserve, and advancing to where she
stood, he bent upon one knee,—“ Oh
divine Princess,” said he, trying to seize
her hand,/* you behold at your feet the
most wretched and unhappyofthe human
race; long have I been the victim of an
hopeless, a never-ending passion,—but
h 4
152 THE ASTROLOGER,
no, I will not call it hopeless, why should
I now despair—its agonies too long 1
have already suffered; Elvira, till now,
I have never dared.to trust to my lips
the secret of my heart, lest they should
tell it in sounds too cold for such a one
as yours. I love, adore you—yes, by
heaven, to madness I love you, not more
sincerely do I worship our great Creator,
than your matchless charms and perfec­
tions, nor more ardently clo I wish for
that heaven, than I do to make you
mme!
*f Instantly unhand me, and begone,
presumptuous, impious wretch,” inter­
rupted the Princess, making a violent
effort to disengage herself, u dare not
again to offend mine ears by language so
gross and insulting—by professions so
unworthy my rank to hear, or your au­
dacity shall meet its proper punishment;
nay, I will this moment to the King my

to your desert.”

u Stay, stay, proud beauty/' said he,
still grasping her robe, “ turn not thus
scornfully from me, nor think I shall so
easily relinquish the hope of obtaining
you—now Orlando is no longer in your
way; and, mark me, Montalban—ah,
start not at the name, the Conde Mont-
alban, I repeat, would make a con­
temptible rival—poor minion1 his time
is past; he knew not, like me, what an
easy conquest is woman to him who

verance—a few sighs and vows, and she
is won; such a one am I— and you shall
find that yours are charms I value too
highly to think any enterprise too difh
cult for the attainmentofthem—0 beau­
teous Elvira/’— and rising, he laid his
other hand on her arm, while she stood
horror-struck and confounded, “ Oh
Elvira, ! from my very infancy, have I
beheld you with admiration—and gazed
with rapture on your increasing loveli­
ness—since nature first taught me what

my heart was formed for, your image has
been indelibly impressed on it.”
“ No more* I command you*—but
quit my presence this moment, unman-
nered hypocrite/* cried the terrified
Elvira; and with aft air of wildness and
desperation, she indignantly dashed him
from her.
He reeled backwards a few paces,
and the crimson tide of madness rushed
to his cheek as he again flung himsell
on a seat to recover breath.
“ Remember this affront, Princess,”
exclaimed he, while rage inflamed his
whole face, “ and hear what it is to
tempt my vengeance—Montalban and
you love each other—but-------- -1
She heard no more—she had, with a
loud cry, thrown open the door, and the
4bad Francisco entered.
“ Protect me, I beseech you, good
Father,” said she, taking the arm oi
the monk; who, being acquainted with
Bon Malvoho’s sentiments, and having
THE ASTROLOGER. 155
been some hours at the Gastello, had
suspected and followed him hither un­
noticed.
“ Silence ! ” roared Malvolio, in a
voice like thunder; “ the sword hangs
suspended over you, haughty Elvira—
breathe but a syllable of what has
passed and it falls ”
“ Peace, miscreant,” said the Abad,
darting a contemptuous look at him;
“ stay not here another moment, or it
tails on you—begone! ”
As if awed by the resolute demeanour
of Francisco, he arose; the colour for­
sook his cheek; his brow became more
contracted; and with a demoniac scowl
he disappeared.
The Princess was violently agitated,
and a considerable time elapsed aftei
his departure ere she was able to reply
to the Abad’s inquiries; her answers
were vague and unconnected, her whole
frame trembled, and every personal
danger, every thing pertaining to self,
n 6
156< THE astrologer:.
was .almost forgotten m the conviction
that Malvolio had indeed learned the
secret of her passion for Montalban. At
first she had,no doubt that his naturally
vindictive disposition, combined with
the repulse she had just given him,
would lead him to disclose immediately
the knowledge of it, and betray Mont­
alban into all the dangers: to be feared
from the too certain indignation cf the
King, when he should hear of an attach­
ment so unlawful and disproportionate,
for, to any that might accrue to herself
she was almost wholly indifferent, so
tremblingly alive was she to every
thing connected with the happiness, or
threatening the safety, of Sebastian!
A little reflection, however, shewed
her how groundless were her apprehen­
sions concerning him; at least, so fai
as depended on the silence of Don Mal-
voho, who, it did not appear probable,
would thus hazard a discovery of h
is«
own temerity , which, if known, would
THE. ASTROLOGER \m
draw upon him a punishment equal to,
if not much more to be dreaded than
s
any that could happen to Sebastian.
This opinion she communicated to
Francisco, who perfectly coincided
with her, and the conviction left hei
mind much more at ease.
Of Ins interview with Bon Malvoho
m the court, or the purport of it, the
Abad spo’ 2 not; but, satisfied of hib
integrity, Elvira thought it prudent not
to advert to it, both from the fear that
he might misconstrue the cause ; and,
at all events, would not approve of hei
having listened to it; and her reluctance
to speak of Malvoho. at all, whenevei it
could be avoided.
“ I rejoice, illustrious Lady, ” said
the monk, “ that oui holy convent can
for awhile afford you and the Señora

tudes incidental to all the inhabitants of

P u y d e n ’s “ State of Innocence ”
IN his dyingi moments Prince Orlando
had requested that his remains should
not be removed to Portugal: but should
be honoured by interment in the vaults
of the royal chapel in Madrid, beside
those of his early friend and companion,
the Prince Henrico; every wish he had
expressed was punctually obeyed, and
amid the consternation and regret of the
whole city; he was consigned to the
tomb in all the solemn pomp the occa­
sion demanded.
On the arrival of the dreadful intel-
THE ASTROLOGER.
160
hgetice of his nephew s death, Alonzo,
Prince of Brazil, immediately repaired
to the Spanish court, by the advice of
the Queen of Portugal, his mother; and
a week had scarcely elapsed aftei the
funeral, when his approach was an­
nounced. This circumstance increased
the general confusion and anarchy to an
alarming pitch; for Alonzo was a man
of known seventy; and on the murderer
he had denounced the most direful pu­
nishments the unconfined laws oi the
country would allow, or human nature
invent whenever he should be found.
But week after week roiled on;, noi
search, nor edict, had succeeded m
bringing the mystery to light; for what
end it had been perpetrated none could
conjecture; at least, their conjecture*
bore no semblance of probability; and
none ever coupled the idea of the illus­
trious Montalban with the recollection
of the murder. At the time it had hap­
pened the latter was supposed to have
T1IE ASTROLOGER 1G1
been in Catalonia; and if, even from
any other cause, suspicion had been
directed towards him, this supposition
would have effectually repelled it; be­
sides it was impossible that a suggestion
of such a nature could arise to tarnish
the fame of a family so universally re­
spected and beloved as that of Vittoria.
In the mean time, the unhappy Se­
bastian, though alive to all the horrors
of his situation, saw that he was at pre­
sent sate from personal danger ; and
that the continuance of that safety pro­
bably depended on himself: true, the
fatal secret was in the possession of
others, but from them he hoped there
was nothing to fear ; and, although he
believed Donna Olivia to be acquainted
with it, his apprehensions on that ac­
count soon vanished, when he reflected
that several reasons would now prevent
her ever revealing it.
Owing to the constant agitation of his
mmd, his health had been little benefited
162 THE ASTROLOGER.
by his excursion: and his anxiety to re­
turnto Madrid, (togaze once more on the
beautiful form of Elvira,) though replete
with danger, became stronger every
day. The murdered Orlando wa* evei
present in his thoughts; the horrid
image, with vindictive visage, and locks
stained with gore, pursued Ins every
step by day; and haunted his uneasy
pillow by night, pouring in his affrighted
ear the most terriblewrath of Heaven.'
The state of solitude in which he had
for some time confined himself tended to
increase those terrific visions, and topre­
servehis intellectsfromabsolute derange­
ment, he found it necessary to quit it.
A thousand times he resolved to
brave the worst at once, to make a
full and ingenuous confession—and Oh,
no——he durst not hope for mercy,
and meet his fate------a fate the most
formidable, with the same strength that
had hitherto supported lnm.
Worlds, (had he possessed them) he
THE ASTROLOGER. 163
would have given, could he have re­
called the fatal deed; and willingly
would he have thus sacrificed himself;
but it was now, alas, too late; and he
as often broke through those resolves,
reflecting on what would assuredly be
the consequences were he to make this
now (as he thought) useless confession,
the lasting disgrace and rum of his
family, the confiscation of their pos­
sessions, the degradation of one of the
noblest and most ancient houses of
which Spain could boast; and, worse
than alb the grief and despair into which
lie had too much cause to know it would
plunge Elvira. Amid these uneasy
waverings he commenced his journey
towards home. Unhappiness, and a
familiarity with sorrow and penitence,
had taught him to moralize, and reason
with himself against the hasty dictates
of the moment; and the retrospection of
other circumstances added fresh pangs
to his already tortured conscience.
164 THE ASTROLOGER.
When imagination pictured to him
the fate to which he had consigned
Donna Olivia; that he, had been the
minister who had executed the black
purposes of the; Queen, he felt his bram
turn round; and that conscience which
he could not disburthen even ol a
crime so comparatively trivial; he now
almost wished to be as flinty and
impenetrable a&a rock, to the stings ot
remorse.
He shuddered at the cruel seventies
to which he fancied Olivia exposed, and
her image, soon superseded even that of
Orlando; the idea that it was possible
to free her from them, and even procure
her a dispensation from her vows, if she
had already pronounced them, (and,
knowing her repugnance to a conventual
life, at the period when he had parted
from her, he sometimes indulged a hope
that she had not) stimulated him, to
make the attempt.
Befurning towards the Pyrenees, he
THE ASTROLOGEll. 165
■ called at St. Marguerite’s, and was ad­
mitted to the presence of the Lady
Abbess, to whom lie made known, the
plan he had formed, to rescue Olivia.
“ And would you, Senor,” asked the
sagacious Superior; “ would you, indeed,
thus brave the vengeance of the Queen? ”
The question startled him ; that such
would follow he could not doubt, and
until now, he had not bestowed a
thought on,it; but even the fear of that
would not have biassed him from his
design, had not the Abbess detailed to
him all that had passed since his last
visit to the convent. The reproaches
winch had at first tormented him were,
however, softened by the assurance of
Olivia's perfect tranquillity m the mo­
nastic state, which had, so happily foi
her, brought her to a sense of all her
former errors, and a reformation so
unexpected.
Alternately regretting and rejoicing
at this event, he proceeded on his

m them there was something which for­
cibly appealed to the heart, and seldom
failed toleave his image stamped on the
more susceptible one of the other sex;
few could boast of more attractive
qualities, or more enviable conquests,—
and few knew better thanAlonzo how to

from experience a lesson of vanity not

his heart—to bid her a last adieu, ere he
witnessed-the event which wouldsecure

thought it probable that were Elvira to

which was very soon increased by a

criminal in the extreme-rand to decid­

undoubtedlylead him to declare his sen­
timents immediately to the King, which,
awaiting her approbation, he had not yet
done,—and she feared that the latter
would be too eager for such a powerful
ally as the prince of Brazil, to reflect
that in securing him, he should sacrifice
the peace and happiness even of this his
beloved daughter.
She therefore deemed it politic at
present, to return an evasive reply to his
suit, determined if Monialban’s loye and
attachment still continued as firm as her
own, after the ordeal by which she
meant to try them, to terminate his sus­
pense, and reward his constancy by be­
stowing entirely on him that heart and
hand for which so many competitors had
hitherto sued m vain, in her subsequent
deportment to Alonzo, she was more re­

put a favourable construction on her
conduct, became a prey to the* most
agonizing pangs ofjealousy, which had
no sooner taken root m his breast, than,
finding a soil that afforded ample nou­
rishment, the baneful weed quicklyvege­
tated and poured its venom through his
heart.
With lynx-eyed scrutiny he pursued
the movements of Alonzo, and having
frequent access to the presence of alt
the royal family, he had opportunities of
discovering many things tending to in­
flame his jealousy still more.
On several nights since Alonzo’s arri­
val, Montalban had observed him going
into the chapel of the Palazzo, where he
continued for a considerable- time,—and
though he could not at first conceive the
purport of his visits there at such late
hours, he soon formed conjectures mili­
tating against his honour, and resolved
to be convinced of their truth or fallacy
even at the hazard of his existence.
THE ASTROLOGER. 179
Having fixed on a certain night for
this purpose, with a mind prepared for
any event that might ensue, he repaired
to the chapel, a little before the Prince’s
usual hour.
A few scattered stars glimmered on
the firmament—the night was gloomy
and tempestuous—he stopped awhile;
the scene reminded him of the eve. of
San Sebastian, and the loud whistling
gale seemed to forewarn him of danger.
He laid his hand on his bosom, which
*
throbbed with violent emotion—his
whole frame trembled—but his resolu­
tion was not to be thus shaken, and
f. : : ./
wiping the cold moisture from his fore­
head, he proceeded. He had not yet
reached the colonnade that fronted the
>
chapel, when he perceived, m the long
perspective, two figures enter by the
principal door, which they immediately
afterwards closed, as the echo of its
hollow sound told.
Almost convinced that Elvira was one

of them, and enraged by the idea pf her
supposed perfidy, he hastily walked on,
and gently opening thedoor, he went in,
and shut it with equal caution—knowing
that none had the privilege of1entering
at pleasure this holy sanctuary except
the royal family.
Uncertain what direction to take, he
stood still for some time, panting for
that vengeance he had vowed to take,
for all within was profoundly silent and
dark, though he had seen a light borne
by one of those who had passed through
the same door. At length an indistinct
sound of voices directed him, and he
moved softly along one of the back
aisles leading to the royal mausoleum.
Again stopping, he listened a moment,
and heard indeed the voice of-—Elvira.
At the same tiihe he saw a faint gleam
of light, which was in an instant ex*
trbguished by the wind, whose dismal
gusts blew from every quarter of this
ancient edifice, and heard the Princess

is somebody in the chapel, and 'without
a light we cannot find the way out ; but
we must, if possible, get a,way unob­
served, for whoever it may be, such a
visitor bodes us no good— and if we stay
here, we but subject ourselves to im­
pertinent intrusion—therefore let us be**
gone.”
They got out of the mausoleum, and
ran along another aisle, and suddenly
they flitted across towards the middle of
the chapel, where they appeared to rest;
but owing to the darkness, and their
long sable robes, he was unable to dis­
tinguish the sex of Elvira’s companion,
andhad only known /¿er by her voice.
“ Then she/ms deceived me— she is
false,” thought the agonized Montalban,
“ but, oh justice and vengeance equal
to my wrongs, ye are now mine—

it mine to crush the Gircean and per­
jured ingrate—to blast her in the midst

fear not death—for her sake i have en­
counteredit, her perjury and ingratitude

to meet it—content mthus disappointing
the haughty Alonzo, and punishing the
unfaithfulness of Elvira.”
His blood appeared boiling at the
maddening thought,—his limbs shook,
his lips quivered, and he became uncon­
scious to every thing but the spirit ol
vengeance which burned within him
“ Ye powers, direct this to hei false
heart,” he exclaimed—his eyes grew
dun—his reason fled ; and, lost to all
else, he rushed forward at once, and
struck the dreadful blow.
It was instantly succeeded by the
noise of somebody falling, accompanied
by a loud scream, which somewhat re-

called his senses, and which he supposed
to have proceeded from Elvira.
Heedless of his own safety, he re­
treated a few paces, and leaned against
one of the pillars, almost in a state ot
stupefaction, from which he was aroused
by a voice crying, ** Good heaven ! I
am murdered,—oh receive my soul \"
It was the voice of his sister—and m
a moment the whole chapel resounded
with mingled cries. A man who was
passing outside with a torch, rushed in,
and by its blue glare discovered the
horrible spectacle of Viola extended on
the ground, weltering in blood, and the
Princess lying motionless beside her.
Almost speechless with terror, he was
about to fly for assistance, when-Mont-
alban, (whom a sense of his awful situa­
tion had now seized,) conjured him not
to mention his name or betray lnm, and
then endeavoured to stop the blood
which flowed from Violas side. “ Oh
Sebastian—my brother !” she exclaimed

as she turned her closing eyes mourn­
fully onhim, “ can it indeed be possible,
is it you who have done this?—but sup­
port me-—
I have not many minutes to
live, see, see—how the redstream flows,
all is just over—fly hence instantly or
you are lost!” She waved her hand for
him to retire,—but still with a look of
frenzy anddespair he clung to her. Her
voice grew fainter, for a moment her
half-opened eyes fell languidly on the
deathlike1form of Elvira, and, with a
grasp which seemed the last effort of
expiring nature, she caught her to her
bleeding bosom, “ Oh this is indeed too
much for me to support/’ she feebly ar­
ticulated, as she exerted herself to em­
brace the senseless Elvira,
As if to verify her words, nature now
seemed to sink at once beneath this ac­
cumulation, of horrors. With a look of
anguish and affection indescribably
mingled, she turned towards the statue­
like form of her brother—her last breath

Uie hand she had held

her side, and she ceased to breathe.
Let fancy now portray the shocking
scene, and behold the Conde bending
over the senseless forms of Viola and
the Princess in agonies too wild for
description. The shoEfc suspirations of
the latter assured him that she lived, if
that could be any consolation to;him
after the measure, ofhis guilt and infatua­
tion had been thus completed. His eyes
rolled fiercely, ,as through the obscurity
around, they sought Alonzo—buthe was
now convinced that the Prince had not
been there at all.
That his suspicions had deeply wrong­
ed Elvira, he could doubt no longer;
and even that conviction alone would
have wrought his agitated soul almost

to madness; yet m the midst of this
appalling scene, the love oflife implanted
m us all by nature still prevailed in him,
(perhaps gained strength by the revival
of the Princess,) over the desperate im­
pulse that had led him to tempt destruc­
tion. Aware that it would inevitably
overtake him if he remained there, and
that his stay was dangerous to himself,
without <benefiting Elvira, who he saw

through one of the side portals leading
moredirectly to hisown apartments, and
had merely time to close it, when the
great Gothic door was flung open, anet
Don Manuel d’Orellez entered, followed
by several others ofthe courtiers.
At first Don Manuel could hardly
credit the evidence of his senses, but it
was too palpable to be long distrusted;
and when he approached the inanimate
and still bleeding Viola, he reeled back
and fell fainting on the floor, from which
he was raised and supported to a seat,
THE ASTfcOLOGEII. 187
while the Princess, roused by the bustle,
opened her eyes; but they had no sooner
rested on the appalling object beside
her, than she uttered a piercing cry, and
relapsed into the same state of insensi­
bility.
At this moment the Marcheze della
Vittoria rushed in with distracted looks.
On encountering a sight so horrible he
was falling, when one of the courtiers,
who stood near, supported him in his
arms, while the Princess and Don
Manuel were taken from the chapel for
the benefit of medical assistance.
They had prepared a sort of litter for
the body of Viola—and having placed
her on it, were about to convey her to
thePalazzo,when the Marcheze suddenly
tore himself from those who held him,
and throwing himself beside the corpse,
franticly bade them desist.
Aware of the danger of complying,
(as from his wild and vacant stare, they
feared his reason was disordered,) they

appeared regardless of his exclamation,
until he snatched1 up the fatal dagger,
which yet lay on the floor, and vowed to
plunge it in the bosom of the first who
should attempt to remove her.
Meantime the man who hadfirst given
the alarm, was secured on suspicion of
his being an accomplice in this dreadful
transaction, (if not the sole perpetrator,)
but the thoughts of what he might be
condemned to suffer^ could not terrify
the noble-hearted Velasquez, from' the
fidelity, he had vowed to the Conde
Montalban, who had long been his
generous friend and patron : his grati­
tude and attachment were inviolable ; he
had ever loved Sebastian with the fond­
ness of a brother, and now, determined
to preserve him even at the risk of his
life, he suffered himselfto be imprisoned
without resistance, trusting for his
safety to the never-failing protection of
Providence, and serene m the conscious­
ness of his innocence.
THE ASTROLOGER. 189
The sudden shock had, indeed, de­
ranged the senses of the Marcheze, who
evinced several symptoms of insanity;
the bye-sianders again attempted to
separate him from the body; but fearing
another fatal event if they persisted,
they were obliged to give over, and re­
treat a few paces from him, terrified by
the fixedness and frenzied expression of
his look.
Tears chased each other rapidly down
his cheeks; suddenly he started, and the
exertion seemed to restore the power of
speech ; he laid his hand on Viola’s pale
cheek, —“ Ah/1 said he in a low voice
as if fearful of awaking her, “ ah she

He raised the dagger towards his
breast; its point was still stained with
blood, and, shuddering, he gazed onit for
some moments; when one of the nobles,
who was nearest to him, perceiving
what he was about to do, darted for­
ward, and in time snatched it from
him.3
A fixed gaze of dreadful meaning pro­
claimed his defeated purpose, and the
mental agonies he suffered.
“ Wouldst thou thus keep me from
my child, inhuman monster ?" exclaimed
he, in a tone of horrid exultation, while
a frightful paleness overspread his

across the body, and was borne with i

Trembling with this idea, he, reached

forbore.

“ Oh Monsenor, you are betrayed;

affrighted Beuraftd, forcing his master
back to his chamber, and ,securing the
entrance to the corridor.
“ Betrayed!— how, what mean youTv
demanded the latter, in momentary un­
consciousness. “ To whom,; my lord, be­

“ view it, and recolleot;” and he drew
forth the fatal weapon from beneath
Ins cloak.
“ Hah 1” exclaimed Montalban, avert­
ing his face, $nd pushing him from him;

“ Even so, my lord; the officials have

“ Bare not name her, or ’twill drive

vehemently; “ let us begone this mo­

their merciless grasp, enclosed in their
infernal dungeons ; let’s away 1 say; or

“ For the love of God, stop Senor:
and beware equally of being incau­
tious,said Bertrand, pulling him for­
cibly from the vestibule door, which he
had flung open, and was hastening
through; “ you cannot go that way;
„ there are sentinels at the extremities of
all the passages, both in that direction,
and at the farther end of the corridor,
waiting for the arrival of the Inquisitors,

a voice like thunder, summoned him

the chief of whom, in his inquisitorial

moment.

Further resistance was unavailing;
and, overpowered by their numbers, he
was bomb through the vestibule, winch
was lined by the military guards from
one end to the other, and placed securely
in the close carriage that was to convey
him to the inquisition, between two men
ofruthless aspect,and repulsive manners.
A death-knell from a neighbouring
convent, now beat mournfully on the
loud blast of midnight, which a clock in
an adjoining cathedral responsively pro-

claimed, in sounds like the hollow echo­
ing of distant thunder. It seemed pro­
phetic of Sebastian’s fate, and recalled
the dying voice of his sister; a cold
chill ran over him, as the wind sometimes
swelled the tones of the passing-bell,
and then, as the wind subsided, they
sank in a solemn cadence: in a few
minutes the bell ceased, and a strain of
devotional harmony rose full upon the
breeze, and thrilled on every fibre of his
heart; it proceeded from the monastery
of Santa Virginia, the nuns of which
were assembled at midnight mass, and
were chanting a requiem to the spirit
ofViola, whose decease had been already
announced, and in a voice almost inar­
ticulate, Montalban asked one of his
companions whether it tens for her, un­
conscious that he was thus criminating
u
himself, and leading to the confession
they intended to extort.

deigning to reply to Sebastian’s question

Paulo, crossing himself, and endeavour­
ing to shrink, if possible, from beside his
captive.

the latter, clasping his hands in violent
agitation. “ 0 Justice, now do thy worst,

THE ASTROLOGER* 203
Further utterance was denied him, his
quick breathings and convulsive sobs
declared the agony of his feelings, and,
sMk'ing back in the carnage, he burst
mib tears.
The severity depicted on the counte­
nances of Antonio and Paulo, seemed to
relax into a sort of momentary pity, but
they regarded him in silence ; their fea­
tures ' soon Resumed their usual charac­
ters, and Sebastian wept unrestrainedly
and continued absorbed within.himself,
until aroused by the stopping of the
vehicle, and the ringing of a large bell.
After driving through’Several obscure
streets, they had at length arrived at the
holy office’, and one of the carriage win­
dows having1teen opened, Montalban
now, for the first time, perceived that

and his eye& then took a hasty view of

he supposed for the few remaining hours
he had to live.
It was chiefly enclosed by a wall oí
immense extent and height, each extre­
mity of which reached the borders of the
Manzanares, whose almostunfathomable
depth of waters washed its base on the
south.
. The entrance was an ancient Gothic
portal, strongly plated with iron, which
was now slowly opened by a man, whose
gaunt: and demoniac appearance made
Sebastian shudder with horror at the
idea of entering a place of which such
a being was an inhabitant.
He was led.from the carriage through
a long vaulted passage, at the further
end of which hung a small lamp, over
an iron door, which was unlocked by one
of the men who kept guard there, and
grating harshly on its rusty hinges, it
unfolded to their view, as far as the eye
could reach by the assistance of a lamp
THE ASTROLOGER 205
that a familiar carried, a succession of
arches, whose extremity was lost m the
profound darkness that enveloped every
farther object.
Montalban’s countenance proclaimed
his reluctance to venture forward amid
the dangers that every thmg seemed to
threaten, notwithstanding the despair in
which he had been plunged a few mi­
nutes before; blit a significant and ill-
meaning glance from Antonio checked
the useless remonstrance he would have
uttered; and, in unbroken silence, they
hurried him on, and, with a sound that
reverberated tremendously through all
the vaults and labyrinths of this abode
of horror, the iron door was >instantly
closed.
Not a word escaped from the lips of
his conductors; no sound interrupted
the death-like stillness, but the echo of
their footsteps, and the frequent sighs
of Montalban, whose blood ran chill at
the suggestion that he was now most

probably traversing the mansions of the
dead, amongst whom' he might soon be
numbered.
From appearances he had nothing to
hope ; and, as he eyed the two officials
m their long black robes, in every fea­
ture of whose faces “ Villain,” was«
legibly stamped; and the guard, whose
lowering countenance and contracted
brow betrayed a mind capable of any
enormity^ he gave himselfup for lost
On each side the glare of the torch
discovered a range of dreary cells, with*
m which were entombed the wretched
victims of this dreadful tribunal; and,
having reached the remote end, they
descended a steep and narrow staircase,
where the sentinel produced a massy
bunch of keys, and with one of them
opened the grating, which let them mto
a spacious and gloomy hall, where they
were received by an official, to whom
the guar1 delivered the keys.
The latter, making signs to them to
TilE ASTTIOLOGEB, 20?
follow him, turned down an avenue of
considerable length, at the bottom of
which he stopped for a few moments;
and apparently put some questions to
the other officials, in language1unintel­
ligible to Montalban; who clung invo­
luntarily to one of the pillars that sup­
ported the roof, on beholding him draw
back the huge bolts and chains of a
large trap-door of iron, which having,
after much exertion, succeeded ni
unclosing, he repeated the same signs
for them to pass through.
An exclamation of terror burst from
Montalban at sight of the frightful
chasm it presented; a few stone steps
near the top were merely rendered
visible by the torch; but beyond,.all
was- impenetrable darkness; and,
during a momeutary pause, he fancied
he heard a groan of anguish re-echoed
through the dungeons beneath.
A last dying moan again broke on his
attentive ear; his blood felt chill at the

dreadful scenes imagination presented,
of racks, tortures and death, in all the
cruellest shapes ; and powerless of
proceeding, he sank almost senseless
upon the pavement.
The fear of personal danger was least
predominant in the emotions by which
he was thus overcome, as he looked on
his own fate as certain as it was ter­
rible ; and every idea of escaping the
diabolical machinations of the Inquisi­
tion, as hopeless, now that they had
him so entirely m their power.
His thoughts, however, were not long
permitted to wander from himself ; the
officials raised him from the ground,
without speaking a word, or appearing,
even by their looks, to be at all affected
by his situation.
Banco, the guard, undauntedly de­
scended the steps, and Montalban,
compelled to do the same, was followed
by the officials, and instantly after­
wards; the trap-door fell into its place,
THE ASTROLOGER. 209
and enclosed them in this horrible
abyss.
After winding down a considerable
depth, through the noisome vapours
that arose from below, the flight termi­
nated in a dark vault, of extent immea­
surable to the eye, from every corner
of which branched long and dreary
passages, equally dark, leading to other
remote vaults and caverns.
Near the stairs was a door of im­
mense magnitude, at which the .chief
official knocked, and the next moment
it was slowly unclosed by another sen­
tinel; who* making the sign of the
cross as they passed, sounded the
watchword to his other companion, who
was pacing an area at some distance,
from which a few dim and imperfect
rays of light proceeded. From the
centre of the roof of this area hung the
lamp whose sickly gleam was merely
sufficient to render “ darkness visible.”
The little light, however, that it did

emit fell full1 oh a large black pedestal
immediately under it, on which stood
the appalling figure of death, leaning on
hiö scathe, with one foot resting on a
coffin, and the other o'ri'a scull.
Here4 they again stopped', and the
official opened an iron chest, and drew
from it*a pair of manacles of the same
metal;' the’ clanking of whose chains
suddenly aroused Montalban from the
torpor into1 which he had fairen*; and
he-beheld several instruments of torture
scattered around, and recesses1 in the
wall filled with skeletons and many
disunited pariirör numan bones.
Ere he had averted liis face from a
¿lglit so* shocking, a door in another
passage opened, and a loud groan of
' agony was in a‘ m’oment resounded m
gradation throughout the whole1subter­
raneous space, and succeeded by an
expiring voice, which m hollow tones
ejaculated, “ Father of Heaven, receive
m'y soul',”' and sank to eternal silence.

Montalbari grew sick and faint, and
reeled back as the door closed again;
but his unfeeling" conductors hurried-
him on, and scarcely had they quitted
the area, when suddenly another door
flew open, and two' familiars emerged
from the interior, carrying torches, and
bearing on their shoulders* a black
frame, on which was extended a corpse,
partly covered by a large1 pall. Its
spirit had but just taken its flight from
the mangled body, whose distorted fea­
tures struck the almost unconscious eye
of Montalban’
, as they passed hastily
through the lohgf perspective, at the fas?
extremity of which they descended into
the burial vaults.
All his energy and strength of mind
now forsook him, and glancing at an

seemed to cease,—*and with a sigh ot
despair, he fell senseless at the feet of

Banco to an adjoining cell for some ot
the familiars to put on his manacles, as
it could be more easily done while he
remained in that state. They lost not a
moment in obeying the summons, and
when they had bound the hands of their
victim together, they assisted to convey
him back to the area, where a small
mug of water was procured from a
cistern, sunk in the ground, and poured
down his throat, after which the signifi­
cant nod of the official bade them with­
draw.
Montalban’s colourless cheek, and the
long suspension of faculty and motion,
made them apprehensive that death had
already anticipated their cruel purpose;
and, in pity to the unhappy sufferer, had
visited him m a shape less dreadful than
that they were preparing for him, and

in silence on Ins inanimate form, beside

the belief that life was wholly extinct,
the official repaired to the tribunal

retraced their way back through the
long avenue, and descended a flight of
broken steps, leading to the cold and
gloomy repositories of the dead.
After several turnings and windings
through the immensity of this silent
abodeofmortality, they reached a remote
vault, in a corner of which they meant
to consign Montalbanto hisnative earth,
and, impatient to finish a task so awful
even to hardened and diabolical wretches
such as they were, they threw the bier
off their shoulders to the ground with a
force that recalled the vital functions oi
Montalban into action, and he breathed
forth a deep sigh, which however es­
caped their hearing, as they were all
. occupied in measuring a newly-made
grave. i
Having ascertained it tobe the proper
size, they were approaching to drag their
victim to it, when suddenly either Mont­
alban moved, or the wind shook the
pall which covered him, and they were
THE ASTROLOGER. 217
transfixed with terror to the spot; but
seeing it again violently agitated, they
became too much alarmed to reflect on
what might be the consequence of a de­
sertion from their duty, and instantly
the torches dropped from their hands,
and they rushed out of the vault.
Montalban gradually revived as if from
a frightful dream, and the wildness of
his countenance would have been almost
as terrific to a beholder, as the surround­
ing scene. It is impossible to conceive
the exact nature of his feelings on per­
ceiving himself m a situation whose un­
paralleled horrors bade defiance to de­
scription.
When he had so far recovered his
senses that he could no longer mistake
reality for an illusion, fie formed the most
terrible conjectures; and the. idea that he
had been conveyed to a place apparently
so remote from the habitations of the
living, and so far from every chance of
rescue, and left to die in a manner the

most shocking to human nature, nearly
again overcame him, and he closed his
eyes to avoid the chilling objects the
vault presented as far as it was m the
power of vision to reach.
Graves newly dug yawned frightfully
on each side ofhim, and at his feet was
one that had been lately filled up,—and
contained, as lie supposed, the corpse
he had seen borne from the room of
torture, which but an hour before had
been a living being like himself,—but
nowhow* awfully changed was its state,
reduced in one short hour to a heap of
corruption*and dust,— Man! one of the
noblest of natures works, now food foi
the worms of the grave!
“ O Omnipotence! can such things
be ?” lie mentally ejaculated; “ for what
inscrutable purpose dost thou permit
atrocities like these to pass unpunished7
why hast thou endued the soul of man
with the faculty of reasoning and think-
mgrr—the power ofacting—and knowing

Cansfc thou unmoved beholdthy creatures

barbarous notions of what-ought to be ?

wretch—fallen far beneath the dignity

too !— Oh if possible, let me shroud my­
self in eternal obscurity,— and here end
the horrible conviction with my life5”
Recalling his thoughts to himself, he
could not contemplate his present state
with any thing like composure ; and
again opening his eyes, he appeared as
220 THE ASTROLOGER,
if only now conscious of the dangers
of it.
. He-started: from off the bier, aroused
by the sight of the pall, which,the fami­
liars had thrown over him,— and the
dreadful thought that one of the graves
beside him had been intended for him­
self, To support such supposition
calmly,, required more than human firm­
ness ; and, with steps rendered unsteady
by his agitation, he was quitting the
vault, determined to hazard all the tor­
tures the inquisition could inflict rathei
than remain there, to expire from a cause
he shuddered to think of, so appalling—
so unnatural, to starve’to death, and in
such a place. When an indistinct sound
of distant voices reached his ear—and
he paused awhile in expectation ofsome
one’s approach, as every other species
of cruelty and wretchedness seemed to
him comparatively sufferable.
Presently a group of figures was seen
THE ASTHOEOGEU. 221
in the distant gloom, whose aspect was
by no means calculated to dispel his
dismal sensations as they drew near.
Their long sable robes, which covered
them from head to foot, corresponded
with the dusky livery of every thing
around; the cowls allowed but a partial
view of the lower part of their grim
visages, as small openings for the eyes
were made in the upper folds, and the
torches they earned threw over then
whole forms an air truly hideous and
worthy the office of demons,—*so that
altogether, he almost fancied himself in
the regions of infernal spirits.
,They moved along in profound silence,
and on entering the*vault they took hold
of Montaiban, without speaking a word,
and led him back to the area, through
the same dreary passages he had tra­
versed before ; >where he found the offi­
cials and guards ready to receive him.
Almost the first object his eyes rested
l 3
222 THE ASTROLOGER.
on there, was thefrowning formofdeath,
to one side of the pedestal that support­
ed it, the chief official applied an iron
rod of a singular shape; and instan­
taneously, as if by talismanic power, a
secret door flew open, and discovered
another dilapidated stone staircase,
whose base was hidden in obscurity im­
penetrable from above; he now beckon­
ed to one of the familiars, who came for­
ward with aiillet, which he was ordered
to bmd round Montalban’s eyes—and
the latter prepared for the worst that
might befal him, and resigned to the en­
durance ofa fate he imagined could alone
expiate by its severity in any degree his
guilt, did not attempt to oppose it.
In a few minutes lie felt himseli
descending, and concluded, from the
length of time they took in reaching the
bottom, that they were several fathoms
under ground, and amongst the lowest
dungeons of the inquisition, as almost
THE ASTROLOGER, ‘
223
all its prisons were subterraneous, espe­
cially those for culprits who were likely
to be condemned to die.
After conducting him through innu­
merable intricacies, they at length
stopped, and unbound lnm, and the chief
official, now advancing and looking
sternly at him, broke the long silence
and addressed him ;—
“ Our holy tribunal,’’ said he, “ is not
at present sitting,—with the first hour
of morning it dissolves,—and thine arri­
vai here was too long after midnight to
permit thy trial to come on, as it is of
too momentous a nature to be got over
hastily— at the third hour they assemble
again— and till the bell chimes ‘ three,’
this is thy prison.”
Without waiting to see the effect this
awful intelligence produced on him,
they immediately quitted the cell; and
having locked and bolted the door, they
departed and left him at leisure to con-
l 4
224 THE ASTROLOGER.
template all the circumstances of his
desperate situation.
Connecting and ruminating slowly on
each, lie busied his thoughts in re­
tracing all the past events of his life.
The epoch of his misfortunes was too
evidently the commencement of his
passion for the Infanta to allow him to
deny the conviction j but soon she rushed
on his fancy in all her native loveliness;
he thought alone of the object of his
long and ardent attachment, his un­
changed affection—his invincible cou­
rage—hisdauntless spirit; and for awhile
forgot all the consequeuces, forgot how
mistaken he hau been in the ardour of
that attachment, forgot the unhappiness,
misery, horror and guilt, into which it
iiadplunged him,—andonly remembered
that to obtain her, he must go on still
farther. The oblivion however quickly
passed away, and retrospection burst on
him- in all its terrors—he now recollected
THE ASTROLOGER. 225
the prophetic warnings he had received,
and beheld the dire effects of his disobe­
dience fully displayed.
That an inhabitant of another world
should have been permitted to revisit
this earth, for the purpose of admo*
mshing him of what would ensue, were
he to set the power of fate at defiance,
was so'Striking a proof of Heaven’s om­
nipotence and goodness, that he shud­
dered with the most terrible apprehen­
sions of its wrathful vengeance for the
crimes his imprudent love had hurried
him into the commission of. The mur­
dered Orlando and Viola presented them­
selves, writhing in the horridest agonies
of assassination, crying aloud for retri­
bution, and the expiring breath of a
sister reproaching him with her murder;
the idea was frightful beyond the con­
ception of any one of lighter con­
science, and he endeavoured in vain to
dismiss it.
These dreadful circumstances had
l 5
226 THE ASTROLOGER.
been the immediate consequences of his
unfortunate attachment and fatal vow,
and, even had they not been of a nature
so tremendous and impressive as to
render every effort to forget them un*
availing, yet ere he could cease to
remember the effects, it was necessary
that he should also banish from his
memory the cause from whence they had
sprung ; but memory was not to be
cheated of its fondest, its dearest object,
an object which it seemed too likely to
retain.
The anguish of his mind was aug-
mentedby the reflection, that the late
event was scarcely more dreadful than
what had given rise to it was groundless
and unwarrantable.
That he could for a moment have har-
boured a thought in any way inimical
to one so faultless, so perfect, (if per­
fection is to be found among the human
race,) as to an imagination glowing as
his was with all the enthusiasm of love,
THE ASTROLOGER, 227
Elvira had ever appeared, seemed so
unnatural, so inconsistent with reason,
so contradictory to his feelings, that were
it not for the too certain and incontro­
vertible proofs of it that existed, he
would have doubted his having- done so.
But love, as well as every other passion,
has Its errors, its eccentricities, its
weaknesses and oversights, in (as many
affirm) a much greater proportion; and,
every one who feels it is the slave of
their capricious influence, susceptible
alike to prejudice and extravagant fond­
ness, yielding hourly to the most ro­
mantic suggestions, unguided by judg­
ment, and unjustified by any appearance
of probability; captious and jealous of
the merest trifles, and sanguine and
unalterable m its more serious resolves.
Through all these extremes had Mont-
alban progressively gone: hope,— the
hope of attainment had hitherto been the
mainspring of all his movements and
actions, but now indeed Hope and her

228 T1IE ASTROLOGER.
delusive train had taken their flight, for,
at the morrow’s dawn it did not seem
likely that he should be an inhabitant of
earth.
To that recollection he was soon
awakened, and the association of painful
ideas it caused, almost deprived him of
his little remaining fortitude, by the
conviction that he was in reality the
wretched outcast he had fancied, aban­
doned even by his father, consigned to
the power of a tribunal formidable to all
Spain, the Inquisition; given up a victim
to their unlimitedbarbarities, their atro­
cities unknown to all but their wretched
unfortunate victims, and by a parent1
u Oh most cruel, most unnatural,” cried
he, as with hasty steps he paced
cell, “ but he is my father, and I must
not curse him—I am a murderer.” He
could pronounce no more ; suddenly he
dropped on his knees, and tried to oflei
up a short prayer, a cold tremoi seized
him, and falling against the wall, he sunk
THE ASTROLOGER. 229
to the ground, and for sometime he lay
in a state of unconsciousness.
While wrapt in uneasy sfcmbers, fancy
still presented the tortures of the Inqui-
tion-m the most appalling shapes; and
the frightful punishments it conjured up
were nearly as bad (worse they could not
be) as those that were really intended
to be inflicted upon him. After awhile,
however, these terrific scenes faded from
his view, and he became more com-
posed; from this wild disorder of his
senses he gradually sank into a calm
and profound sleep, rendered more
sweet and soothing by dreams of happi­
ness to come, unalloyed by the remem­
brance of past or present sufferings
From these pleasing visions he was at
length aroused by a slight noise, like
the gentle tread of footsteps near him;
he listened for awhile, and all was per­
fectly still, but presently he thought he
felt the hand of some person unseen laid
upon his shoulder, and a low voice,
230 THE ASTROLOGER.
merely audible, and apparently fearful
of being overheard, bade him arise, and
again embrace his liberty.
The sound of liberty thrilled through
his bosom with a sensation of the most
exquisite pleasure: convinced that he
had heard a human voice, and that its
tones were familiar to his ear, he started
up, but nobody was to be seen, all was
silent as before; the delusion seemed
the effect of his dreams, and he would
have again tried to sleep, had he not, m
spite of reason, fancied that the same
friendly voice still addressed him. That
he had heard that voice before (though
when or where, he tried in vain to re­
collect) he was now confident, and
equally so that it was that of some
person he knew, and whose friendship
he valued. But then the improbability
of finding a friend m such a place as the
Inquisition, almost staggered this belief,
and, perplexed with contrary opinions,
he again walked to and fro. But it is
THE ASTROLOGER. 231
impossible to determine what were his
predominant feelings on beholding a
narrow opening m the wall-beside him,
sufficiently large for one person to pass
through, winch had not before been .per­
ceptible, as by the dim ray of light
which descended through the gratings
of several upper cells, budt over each
other, and raised apparently to the top
of the structure, he was enabled to
grope round the walls, in order If pos­
sible to find some means of escape, tor,
the natural impulse that attaches us ah
to life, forced its way to his heart, amid
all its contending emotions.
But here the strictest caution was ne
cessary, for beyond the aperture, every
thing (if space there was) was pro­
foundly dark and silent; and he was in­
clined to think, that so singular a circum­
stance must have been accomplished by
supernatural means, or else, a snare con­
trived. by some of the members of the
Inquisition, to lure him to some still
232 THE ASTROLOGER.
more remote and horrible dungeon,
where his destruction could be effected
without the trouble of a trial, and whose
seeresy might defy the utmost scrutiny
of mortal. But now, that he had been
thus voluntarily delivered mto the powei
of the holy office, the obscurity ofwhose
transactions none were bold enough to
pry into, it did not appear probable,
that any body was interested about him,
or cared what might be his fate: he
durst not hope, that even Elvira thought
of him but with horror, his crimes w-ere
loathsome to himself, his hands stained
with human blood, and the atrocious
outrage he had committed on the ve­
neration due to their holy church; al­
ready he saw, in anticipation, all the
tortures the inquisitorial laws denounced
on such offenders; andalready he almost
fancied himself clad in the Santo Benito,
led in the awful procession of the auto
da fd, and dragged to the fatal stake;
yet, worse than all this was the thought
that Elvira now abhorred him.
THE ASTROLOGER. 233
On consideration it now appeared
probable, that some mysterious being
withm the walls of the Inquisition was
indeed his friend; and, re-assured by
this idea (though it was impossible to
conjecture who it might be, if not the
Almighty alone), a gurgling noise, like
the distant roaring of waters, broke on
his attention ; and, as he eagerly listened
to its faint murmur, a gleam of hope re­
vived in his bosom, though he scarcely
knew why, for he was not aware that
his prison was sunk almost beneath the
depth of the Manzanares, which never,
he conjectured, ran close by its walls,
and, absorbed in his unhappy state, he
had not observed it before.
At this time it was long after two
o'clock; and at length the half-hour
struck dismally, and warned him that, if
there was a chance of escape, he must no
longer hesitate to seize it.
It was certain that his situation could
not possibly be worse, as he was here
234 THE ASTROLOGER.
in the same danger of death as he should
be m any other part of the Inquisition;
and, every circumstance tending to sti­
mulate him to the attempt, he ap­
proached the aperture, and, extending
his hand outside, it rested on the small
door, which he found war* so formed as
to open and shut without noise, by
means of a secret spring; he therefore
concluded, that, m his fall, he must have
touched that spring; and thus, acci­
dentally, or rather providentially, been
directed to the only way by which he
might avoid the otherwise-certain death
he should have met.
In his ardour he forgot every ob­
stacle, and thought not of the absurdity
of attempting to escape from a place
that might truly have answered for the
abode of Lucifer, and the horrors of
which it is scarcely m the power ot
human comprehension to form a just
picture of.
A dark and mouldering ceil, dug far
THE ASTROLOGER. 235
below the level of the earth, that looked
more like a grave than an habitation for
mortal, its natural1sickening atmosphere
was rendered yet more unwholesome by
the constant damps from the water that
flowed outside, dmost from its base to
the top; its dismal gloom was aug­
mented by a solitary glimmer of light
that penetrated the long succession of
gratings m the centre of every cell above
it; and all parts of the edifice were
strongly fortified by nature and art, en­
vironed on every side, but that of the
river, by thick and insurmountable walls,
and vigilantly guarded by people long
devoted to the laws, and subservient to
the will of the holy office. So that al­
together, had Montalban taken much
time to deliberate,, lie must have yielded
to despair.
Confident,of success, he breathed
forth a short but fervent prayer of gra­
titude to Heaven; and, without con­
sidering that it might merely lead him
236 THE ASTROLOGER.
further into those labyrinths of death,
he ascended an extensive flight of steps,
which seemed to wind round a sort of
tower; he had got (as he supposed)
^ábout half-way, when, in the pauses of
the blast, he thought he heard a strain
of music, whose mellow tone seemed to
proceed from some person on the 11ver,
and, stopping to listen, he was m a
moment assured of it. He fancied these
sounds were also familiar to his eai>
though he could not at first call to mind
where he had heard them before. But
he soon conjectured aright, as in a
few minutes more he was happily con­
vinced.
With redoubled alacrity he pursued
his way, and after ascending nearly an
hundred steps more, he reached the
summit, and found himself on.a-spacious
rampart, that overlooked the broad ex­
panse of the Manzanares.
His whole frame was dilated with
new sensations on being again enabled
THE ASTROLOGER. 237
to respire freely, and, intent on li­
berty at any hazard, he looked anxiously
around.
Notwithstanding1 the darkness of the
night, as the storm had ceased a consi­
derable time, he espied a little' boat,
sailing to and fro on the water, close
to the wall of the dungeon he had just
quitted; and presently afterwards he
recognized the voice of his faithful
Bertrand; and calling him by name, the
latter instantly looked up, and joyfully
exclaimed— “ Oh, Senor! my dear, dear
Lord, I have found you at last; thanks
to all our holy saints/’
There was another man in the boat
with him, who immediately checked
the ardour of his affectionate eloquence,
aware that they risked their lives in
this perilous undertaking; and added,
just loud enough for Montalban to hear;
*f Indeed we cannot tarry here much
longer, and I fancy the Senor must make
a desperate effort if he would escape, for
238 THE ASTROLOGER.
there is not a single window or opening
on this side of the building.”
It was only now that Sebastian felt
sensible of his almost hopeless condition,
for his mind had been so fully occupied
by the idea of liberty, that he had not
thought of any means by which he could
actually effect it; and as he sought m
vain for some other descent that might
deliver him from this fatal spot, he was
nearly tempted to return to his cell, and
await the terrible doom he would un­
doubtedlyhave been, consigned to. This
resolve was however momentary, and
the calls of Bertrand roused him into
energyandexertion; butagain hepaused,
he saw no way of escape, save one—and
that one was indeed dreadful, even m
idea; his eye measured eagerly the
tremendous depth from the rampart,—
and while he stood fearful and irresolute,
the great clock m the court below pro­
claimed the hour of "three.” ^
Its heavy sound was quickly followed
THE ASTROLOGER. 239
by a loud and discordant noise in the
prisons underneath, as the familiars flung
open the massy iron doors, to drag forth
their victims to their direful fates; and
a bell sullenly sounded through the in­
terior of the building, to convene the in­
quisitors to the tribunal; probably they
had by this time missed, and were m
search of him,—horrible suggestion l
(( Yet inflying from death in one shape,”
thought he, “ am I not rushing to it in
another ?” At all events nothing but des­
peration could save him; he looked
once more on the immense height on
which he stood from the water, and,
shuddering at the thought of taking
such a leap, he recoiled, and was again
descending to his cell, when the same
mysterious voice he had before heard,
recalled him,—and bade him throw him­
self at once into the river, or the delay
of another minute would prove fatal to

The conviction that it would prove so,
240 THE ASTROLOGER,
instantly rushed on his mind, and with­

friend might be, he mounted the battle­
ments—and m a moment of despair he
plungedheadlong into the profundity of
waters beneath.

out of the boat, determined to find him
or perish in the attempt; when suddenly
the body rose to the surface of the
water, which it tinged with aneffusion of
blood that poured violently from the
mouth and nose. In a moment lus pre­
sence of mind returned, and hastily
snatching one of the oars from the
trembling hand of old Carlos, with
one spring he dexterously drew up the
skiff, and assisted by his companion,
succeeded, after much exertion, in res­
cuing his beloved master from a watery
grave.

was to strike off the

and perseverance to do,l

They then rowed towards the little
dwelling of the good fisherman, knowing
that it would be equally dangerous and
unavailing to trifle with him by trying
to restore animation at present,—and
Carlos, though of a disposition naturally
humane, and heedless of any hazard in
relieving ¡a¡fellow-creature, had so very
reluctantly ventured within sight of the
black and ponderous walls of the In­
quisition, whose terrific scenes he had
often heard of, that he now steered
down the rapid stream with redoubled
speed.
The cottage stood at the distance of
about a mile, on the bank of the river,
butiso closely sheltered by overhanging
rocks, and the interwoven branches of;a
cluster of oak trees‘that surrounded -it,
that, until they landed, it was not dis­
cernible.
Having moored the boat on the-beach

almost to death—and when I found you
did not come home at your usual time,
I thought you had been lost in the river,
and so went in search of you, and you
may easily guess how I felt ever since.
But who is this other Senor—and what
have you got m that great bundle, for I
am sure you could not have caught so
much fish to night ?”—
“ Come now, good dame,” said Carlos,
half smilingat die last observation, “ you
must not scold me for staying out this
once, for I have caught as much trout as
will sell for half a dozen piastres in to­
morrow's market-—but no more about it

now—we have something of much more
consequence to look to in this bundle as
you call it; we have got a Bon of quality
almost dead, and nothing but instant as­
sistance can save him, for we have just
taken him out of the water,”
“ Out of the water!” reiterated Ursula,
as she led the way in, “ Mercy on us,
no wonder his Excellenza should be
almost dead—but I hope we shall be able
to recover him still—poor dear soul, if he
is not entirely lifeless I don't despair—
for, though i say it myself, I have saved
many a one before by my humble
skill”—
“ Aye, wife, thatyou have— andGodwill
reward you forit,” said Carlos, layingthe
benumbed form of the Conde-on a bench,
before a cheerful blazing fire, which, not'
withstandingthe unseasonableness ofthe
hour, the affectionate Ursula had kept
beside her husband’s supper.
Bertrand now stripped him of his wet
garments, and having made a small bed
THE ASTROLOGER. 247
near the hearth, they placed him on it,
and began chafing his hands and tem­
ples and applying heat to the soles of
his feet; while Ursula was assiduously
endeavouring to force some of her
cordials and medicated balsams into his
mouth.
A quarter of an hour passed in un­
ceasing applications—but without ef­
fect—and Montalban lay to all appear­
ance dead.
Bertrand had no sooner felt the dread­
ful conviction than he fell back, and burst
into tears—he had almost determined in­
stantly to summon medical or surgical
assistance, but he considered that if a
ohance of returning animation still re­
mained to his master, such proceeding
would defeat its own purpose, for when
it should be known that he had escaped
from the Inquisition, and that the good
fisherman and his wife harboured him in
their cottage, they should feel the ven­
geance of the holy office, and the
w 4

iatal blow would strike all indiscrimi­
nately.
Ursula’s tears flowed copiously as she
held the cold hand of the Conde in
. hers,
and hung over him m sorrow almost as
poignant as Bertrand’s. A flush on her
withered cheek announced some sudden
thought, it seemed the inspiration of
Heaven, and with a smile of hope and
confidence, she suggested that bleeding
might succeed in restoring him,if a spark
of life yet remained—►the proposal was
too congenial with the wishes of each,
and the probability of its good effects
too apparent to be rejected—but again
they hesitated ; how was an operation
that required so much caution and skill
to be performed ?
In his youthful days Carlos had been
employed in some of the domestic of­
fices of an hospital, and by a little curio­
sity and attention he had acquired an
insight into many trifling things attached
to the surgical department, and still pre**

served several relics of his former pleas­
ing occupations, amongst which was an
old case of lancets—Ins hand was how­
ever so unsteady now that he was aware
of the rashness of his attempting to
bleed, although he perfectly recollected
the manner in which he had so often seen
it done.
Conscious that, however desperate
was the alternative, it was assuredly bet­
ter to have recourse to it than leave any
means untried—as ifhe were not already
dead, nature at least was too much ex­
hausted to recover spontaneously, oi
without their utmost exertions.
As Carlos therefore was incapable of
performing this last office, Bertrand,
wiping away his tears, sprang forward,
and throwing himself at the feet of the
old man— “ I beseech you,” he cried,
“ let me try—the urgency of the case
must plead against my inexperience,
and perhaps through Heaven’s will I may
succeed”—he seemed tohaveanticipated

the thoughts of Carlos, who having
fetched one of the lancets, with a basm
and some old linen, desired Ursula to
bare one of the Conde’s arms, and di­
rected by him, Bertrand gently opened
the most prominent vein.
For some time the blood came only in
drops, but with a little dexterity they
soon induced an uninterrupted stream,
and when they had got about a pint,
Ursula, laying her hand on his wrist, felt
a slight pulsation. By the time that his
arm was bound up, the symptoms of re­
turning life were unequivocal, and all
with one voice fervently exclaimed,
“ Oh Father of-mercies! there is nothing
to thee impossible/’ and sunk on their
knees in joyful and pious effusions of
gratitude to Heaven.
A sigh from Montalban recalled their
attention—and Ursula reaching a goblet
of home-made wine she had mulled for
him, with 'much difficulty forced him to
swallow some of it which contributed in
THE ASTROLOGER. 251
a great measure to re-animate him, and
at length 1ns gradually unclosing eyes
rested with a melancholy expression on
Bertrand, who clung to him with all the
affectionhis warm heart was capable of—
convinced that he lived, all ceremony
and distinction were forgotten, and he
clasped him to his bosom with a cry of
joy-
Pleasure and self-approbation beamed
on the benevolent countenances of
Carlos and his wife, on witnessing the
success of their unwearied efforts, in
the recovery of Montalban, who was,
however, alike unconscious of their
friendship and its effects; and his wild
and unmeaning gaze soon filled them
with apprehensions of the derangement
of his intellects.
“ Hah! who art t h o u c r i e d he in a
frantic voice—suddenly starting and
dashing Bertrand violently from him—
“ Avaunt, black minister of hell, thou

but thinkest thou that I cannot escape

her—I—I----- !!!”
Convulsive sobs prevented furthei
utterance, and he wept till worn out
with fatigue and anguish, he dropped
into Bertrand’s arms, where he remained
until his senses were composed by a
light sleep.
Ursula having prepared their best
bed for the Conde’s reception, he was
conveyed to it, while Bertrand, deter­
mined to watch beside him, thanked
the good old couple for their humane
THE ASTROLOGER. 253
attention, and services, promising that
they should not be long unrewarded ;
after which they retired to repose for
the remainder of the night, happy m
the consciousness of what they had
done, md wondering, not without a
degree of alarm, at the frightful excla­
mations of the Conde, of whose name,
rank and misfortunes they were yet
entirely ignorant. But when they re-
- collected what he had last said relative
to the murder of his sister, they shud­
dered with horror at the suggestion
that it was not merely a chimera of the
brain, but in all probability the crime
for which he Jiad been imprisoned in
the Inquisition,
After a long pause Carlos significantly
shook his head, and cast on Ursula a
look expressive of surprise and doubt ;
and observing that,. *
*should it prove to
be the case, they had *rendered them­
selves amenable to the tortures of the
holy office m rescuing and sheltering

him, he offered up a prayer to the ail-
wise Disposer of events, and sunk by
degrees into the sweet sleep of inno­
cence and peace.
While Bertrand sat beside his masters
bed, watching his every movement with
anxious fidelity, and almost inhaling his
every deep-drawn sigh, he strove to
connect some evasive story which might
baffle the inquisitive loquacity of Carlos
and his wife, relative to the Conde,
about whom, he naturally supposed
they would make many minute inqui­
ries on the following day.
When the officials from the Inquisition
had made Montalban their captive, had
Bertrand been guided by the immediate
impulse of his heart/ he would have un­
hesitatingly followed, to share his suf­
ferings and confinement. But fortu­
nately the promptitude of reason and
foresight, which strong and vigorous
minds alone are capable of retaining,
withheld the impellent power by its
THE ASTROLOGER. 255
superior and more energetic claims, and
convinced him of the inutility and im­
prudence of such a step; in adopting
which he would have voluntarily, yet
unconsciously, consigned him to almost
certain death, by turning his back upon
the only chance that might enable him
to avert it ; and a little reflection made
him sensible that his duty and affection
could be better evinced by sacrificing
his present enthusiastic feelings even
to the mere possibility of ultimate ad­
vantage in the project he had suddenly
conceived. He could not, however,
help feeling that it was also possible,
nay, probable, that his plan might fail;
that they should meet no more; and that
the machinations of the Inquisition
were too deep, mysterious and inevitable
to allow the indulgence of a sanguine
hope.
When the officials had taken him
away he walked on mechanically, with
streaming eyes, to the entrance of an
256 THE ASTROLOGER.
extensive subterraneous passage, leading
to the outskirts of the city, and through
which he had intended that his master
and himself should accomplish then
escape.
By some stratagem he had procured
the key of this place, which had hung
m a closet near the Conde's apartment
in the Palazzo; and which, from having
been stationary for a long time, was
now almost entirely covered with
rust.
Having rubbed it with a little oil
from the lamp he carried beneath Ins
outside vesture, the better to conceal it
and himself, after many repeated efforts
he forced the lock to yield. With a
creaking noise the door opened, at the
same time unfolding to his view the
various horrors of an old and dreary
cavern, which had been shut up for
several years past
He was not much inclined to super
stition or ideal torrors; therefore recoh

lecting his master s situation, and that
he might be the instrument of his pre­
servation, he readily entered, notwith­
standing the almost suffocating vapours
that arose from the chapel vaults, which
communicated with it by many intricate
turnings. It was however an under­
taking to which had there been a less
powerful incitement, he might not have
had sufficient courage to go through,
for ere he had got half-way he was so
weaned by stumbling over old fragments
of the arched roof which had fallen in,
and so sickened by the offensive air,
that he was obliged to rest for some
minutes against a broken statue of San
Lorenzo, to whom in former days the
cavern and chapel had been dedicated,
and these holy relics of antiquity had
lam here neglected and forgotten for
almost a century.
At every step he took, the mutilated
image of a saint, or the time-eaten busts
of their most celebrated devotees pre-
THE ASTROLOGER,
258
seated themselves to his gaze, and
awakened a solemn sort of feeling little
short of the enthusiasm their originals
had once felt*
After a tedious search, he at length
found the door m the opposite extre­
mity, and having opened it with the
same key that had unlocked the other,
hft entered a thick grove of high trees,
which ran along some huge mountains
downto the nver-side.
Near the bank, and extending a con­
siderable distance, he knew there were
several little fishing-boats, belonging to
the poor inhabitants of the neighbouring
hamlets, always stationed after their
day’s toil; and his determination being
fixed, he quickly glided amongst the
trees, and emerged from their shade
just time to hear and stop the footsteps
of an old man, who, moaning with fa­
tigue, was at that lute hour carrying
home the fruits ofhis dangerous cruize.
“ Stop, I prithee, my friend,” cried
THE ASTROLOGER. 259
Bertrand— “ I would a few words with
you: you see I am defenceless, and
mean no harm.”
This sudden greeting acted like elec­
tricity on the terrified Carlos, who, con­
cluding him to he a robber in search of
prey, the solitude of the place being*
favourable to people of that description,
staggered against a tree, while his little
cargo of fish fell to the ground, as he
exclaimed— “ There, there, Senor, take
them, and welcome; much good may
they do you—but, oh! in mercy spare
my-life."
Though agitated by contrary emo­
tions, Bertrand could not help smiling
at the simplicity of the poor man, and
cautiously advancing, lest others might
be within hearing, he said, in a low voice
— Be not alarmed; I know not what
you take me for—but you can materially
serve me, and if you will do so, you
shall be well rewarded, as an earnest of
which take this little purse,”
260 THE ASTROLOGER.
There was an ingenuousness in Ber­
trand's manner* which even Carlos could
not mistake; and first glancing at the
purse* and then looking strait m his
face, as if unwilling to" be too hastily
biassed, he faltered out— “ If you are
not upon any evil design, Senor Conde,
or whatever your Excellenza may be,
this is surely a strange hour for you to
be prowling about such a deserted place.
Now, Senor, I should like to know what
you want of me; it cannot be money,
for, by San Jago, I am not worth a single
rial—but say at once what can I do
for you.”
Lend me your boat, and come with
me a little way down the river,” said
Bertrand.
“ Gh, Giesu!” cried Carlos, more
terrified than before, and shrinking back
towards the tree he had quitted—“ Down
the river again, indeed! No, no, I have
had quite enough of it for this night,
but I now understand you, Senor; you
THE ASTROLOGER. 261
want to decoy me on the water to drown
me, and then go offwith the boat and the
fish together— truly a hopeful reward I
should get for the loan of my boat.”
“ In truth,” said Bertrand, half laugh­
ing, and half vexed at this» ridiculous
suggestion—“ you are an odd fish your­
self, to entertain so absurd an idea; but
come, don’t trifle thus with me, do what
I require, and you may depend on my
word for your safety, and a noble re­
compense.”
“ No,” returned Carlos, “ ifI am an
odd fish, I am also an old one, and will
not be taken by your bait. So, good
night, Senor.” With these words he
made a sudden dart at the basket of
trout, and was out of sight in a mo­
ment.
Bertrand, regarding the delay of every
instant as pregnant with danger to his
s
master, and thinking it useless to follow
the old man, without further hesitation
approached one of the skiffs, and tried to
262 THE ASTROLOGER.
untie the huge knot by which it was se­
curedto the bank. All his perseverance
was however withouteffect; and, with an
expression of bitter disappointment, he
was about to relinquish his scheme al­
together, when turning, he saw Carlos
again coming towards him, who, having
deposited his basket in a place of com
cealment; and, not thinking that the
boat was .quite safe, had returned to
watch beside it at any risk, while the
object of his fears remained.
Bertrand now recovered his wavering
resolution, and not intimidated by the
suspicious lookthat Carlos fixed on him,
he caught the hand of the latter, and
besoughthim to-listen quietly to a short
explanation.
The zealous glow that animated his
countenance, and the moving pathos of
his voice soon qperated on the feelings
of his kind-hearted auditor; who, view­
ing his features, desired him to¡proceed.
“ I am fully aware/' resumed Ber-
THE ASTROLOGER. 263
trand, athatappearancesaremuchagainst
me,— and allow the justness of your re­
mark, that my being here at this late and
silent hour looks like no good intent,—
but mark me,—I call Heaven to witness
the purity of my heart, and the worthy
enterprise I am about to undertake.
My master, (whom next to my God I
love and reverence,) is a man of high
rank and consequence, a trifling affair
has involved him in the hands of justice,
justice do I say,—this night I have be­
held him dragged to the Inquisition,
whence, unless he be immediately res­
cued, he never can escape ; it may so
happen, that his prison will be on the
side of the building which overlooks the
river,—and if you will accompany me,
we will at least make the only attempt
in our power to liberate him,—nay
Heaven itself inspires the thought, and
whispers that we shall succeed,”
At the mention of the Inquisition,
Carlos could not conceal his terror, but
264 THE ASTROLOGER.
from the resolute manner of Bertrand,
he saw that remonstrance would be un­
availing, and feeling the whole circum­
stance as a claim on his humanity, he
dismissed every interested idea, and
with that promptitude of friendship
which generally marks the Spanish cha­
racter, when called forth by the suffer­
ings of a fellow-creature, he went with
Bertrand into the boat, which m a short
time, bore them to the walls of the holy
office.
The latter now took out a small flute,
on which he was an excellent performer,
and played several pathetic little airs,
which had often caught the attention of
his master, not however without appre­
hensions that sounds so unusual might
attract the notice of some other members
of the Inquisition, and perhaps lead to a
discovery: for harmony had probably
never before softened the horrors of this
dreary spot; but the reader is acqu aint-
ed of the fortunate result.
THE ASTROLOGER. 265
The Conde now awoke; a long sleep
had composed his senses, but had not
been able to repel the attacks of an
illness which threatened to be tedious in
its progress, and not unattended with
danger; the benignity that sparkled in
his intelligent eyes, as he turned them
gratefully on his preservers, (for Ber­
trand had made him sensible of his pre­
sent situation and all he had undergone,)
spoke to their very souls those feel­
ings of acknowledgment which words
would not have been powerful enough
to express.
Carlos and Ursula came at an early
hour to see how he had passed the
night, and found him labouring under a
low fever, which increased m the course
of the day to such an alarming height,
that Carlos, who was going to the city
to market, urged the necessity of having
medical advice; but aware how unsafe
his situation was in other respects, and
that such a measure would subject him

266 THE ASTROLOGER.
to discovery and probably to consequent
death, lie decidedly declined it, not
altogether because he feared to die, and,
alas1 for death and an after-state he
reflected he was ill prepared; but still
he felt thatsomething, which, throughout
his errors and misfortunes, had yet at-,
tached him to life, and from which the
image of Elvira had never been se­
parated.
Too faithfully did memory now por­
tray past scenes, at once delightful
to view, and dreadful to dwell upon; he
loved Elvira with that pure and exalted
fervour of soul which knows no disparity
of rank, and which alone can dignify,the
too-often misapplied term ; and, finding
its kindred glow in her bosom, their
vivid coalescence gave to each an equal
portion of that sublime passion which
so.truly-ennobles the human mind.
Bqtoh1 how enormous and irreparable
were1 the sacrifices he had .made ! his
peace on earth—perhaps—oh horrid,
THE ASTROLOGER. 267
horrid thought! perhaps his salvation
hereafter; to attain his object, he had
dared even to become a murderer! how
tremendous the depth into which one
rash step had hurled him, far beyond
the power of mortal to extricate him;
for who can blot from the register
of our conduct, our crimes and errors
here on earth, or from an ever^waking
conscience, this dreadful violation of the
bounds which Heaven has set to the
passions of man 9 His sister, too, had
fallen a victim to those unguarded pas­
sions, all the tortures of the rack would
have been more easily borne than that
consideration; and he almost wished
that he had awaited death in the most
formidable shape the inquisitors could
devise.
And yet he was not deserted entirely;
he still beheld by his side friendship
in the most inviting forms, in the per­
sons of Bertrand andMs generous hosts,
whose every look, word, and movement,
sr 2
268 THE ASTROLOGER.
corresponded with the ideas he had
formed ofthem. The voice of friendship
had reached him even in the Inquisition',
which surely proved beyond a doubt
that God had not wholly abandoned
him, for was it not by the divine will
that he had been so mysteriously libe­
rated at a moment when the sword of
death was about to fall on him; and to
human means alone it seemed ungrateful
and impious to attribute it. From this
circumstance he could not doubt that
God was still his friend, that still he
extended ,his clemency towards him,
and watched over him wherever he
went; and, if so, he had every thing to
hope. This thought re-ammated him,
and he no longer gave way to despair,
round his bed frisked Rosa, his little
attendant, the grand-daughter of the
venerable Ursula; and, her playful vi­
vacity and artless observations amused
him for awhile, in spite of the rapid
progress of his disorder; but it was
THE ASTROLOGER. 26'9
coming to it crisis that threatened a
fatal event, if medical aid were longer
withheld.
A week had he now lain beneath this
hospitable roof,, during which time no
entreaties could prevail on Bertrand to
quit the apartment for ten minutes toge­
ther; and, when he slumbered, his head
reclined on the same pillow that sup­
ported the aching one of his lord.
No inquiries, or even the most distant
hint that might lead to the elucidation
of the mystery which hung over their
guests, had hitherto escaped the lips of
Carlos or his wife: it was sufficient to
their humane hearts that Montalban was
a fellow-creature, that his sorrows de­
manded their sympathy, his misfortunes
their commiseration, and his declining
health every exertion and attention they
could bestow. Providence had indeed
elevated their lowly condition in life far
above the pageantry of wealth, or the
glittering pomp of titles: in these poor
n 3

and unambitious cottagers He had im­
planted an independent spirit of virtue
and goodness, which, reared in the
wholesome soil of humility, flourished
in its maturity, safe from the withering
power which the luxurious glow of rank
and splendour possesses, and withwhich
it seldom fails to subvert it.
The interesting appearance of the
Conde, his handsome features, whose
fine expression even sickness could not
change, and the winning affability of his
manners, had soon gained their admi­
ration, love, and esteem; and thepretty
llosa, as she sometimes innocently fixed
her eyes on him, while she prattled her
little tales to amuse him, declared that
she loved him dearly because he was
so like the sweet young Señora who
used to come so often to see;them, and
always gave them money and clothes.
“ And, when Sunday comes,” added
she, u you shall see the finr* frock she
gave me, for my grandmother says I

she makes me pray for her every night
and morning, and 1 will pray far you
also, because I always remember yen-
when I think of her.”
The smib or kiss that Rosa’s enters

she thought the highestreward she
could have received. Thus did she pass
the day, and when night arrived she
parted fromMontalban with tearful eyes,
as Ursula put her early to bed,—and
Hew to him again as soon as she rose
nest morning,
Carlos and Ursula, while they treated
their guest with the respect due to his
rank, (which many circumstances made
them conclude tobe very superior,) were
led insensibly to feel for hinx an attach­
ment almost parental, which was every
day strengthened by some new instance
of the natural goodness of his disposi­
tion. As soon as there appeared in his
disease a probability of danger, Carlos
n 4
2 7 2 THE ASTROLOGER,
no longer hesitated to follow his own
will msummoning a physician ; lie com­
municated his intention to his wife, who
was of opinion* that at least Bertrand
ought to be apprized of it, as he know­
ing his master’s critical situation, they
doubted not he wouldreadily- concur m
their proposal, and agree with them on
the propriety of it, trusting that the
Conde would afterwards pardon a dis­
obedience now so essential to his safety.
Accordingly, when Carlos had got his
instructions with regardto the necessary
caution and secrecy, but in a manner
that could not awaken suspicion, he set
out with his little stock of fish toMadrid,
and having disposed of it, he proceeded
to execute the rest of his commission.
The gloom of twilight shaded Mont-
alban’s chamber, and Rosa was, as usual,
trying to amuse him, when an exclama­
tion of affright, which she suddenly
uttered, drew his attention towards the
door, which had been thrown open to

admit a tall skeleton-looking figure,
dressed in black, and of no very prepos­
sessing appearance, who, carrying his hat
in his hand, and bowing almost to the
ground, approached the bed.
Just as heentered, the child had hidden
her face behind the curtain but the
moment she ventured to peep forth, and
beheld his lean and sallow visage, and
awkward movements, as he continued
bowing at every step, she burst into a
loud laugh; while Montalban, raising his
languid eyes, stared in astonishment,
and vainly tried to account for the in-
trusionofsueha strange-lookingcreature.
“ So please your Excellent,” said
Bertrand, endeavouring to check a smile,
and turning to his master, “ this Senor
is a physician, whom my fears for you
have made me take the liberty of apply­
ing to~~and i hope for your forgiveness
when you consider the motives that in­
fluenced me.”
" Fes, Senor,” interrupted the stran-

tion, and assuming an air of importance,

verse,—and now here I stand in propria
persond, at your service.”
At this ludicrous speech, Bertrand
could no longer keep his risible muscles
witliin the bounds of gravity, and, un­
able to smother, a laugh, which evidently
disconcerted the poor doctor, he turned
aside, while an involuntary smile-stole

latter, taking Sebastian’s wrist between
his fore-finger and thumb, with an air of

things are now, I fancy, on the mending
hand.”
“ On the mending hand!” Sebastian
involuntarily repeated, and raised him­
self m the bed for a moment— “ Good
Dottore, what has happened—nothing
fatal I hope?”
To any other person than II Dottore,
THE ASTROLOGER* 277
who was too much wrapt in his own
consequence, Sebastian's agitationwould
have betrayed him; but Sudonfico,
gravely projecting his under hp, again
felt his pulse, and told him, he must
now try to compose himself to sleep,
and allow nobody to disturb him. "Nil
desperandum, Senor,” said he, “ I will
now send you something, to keep the
vital spark in action, and shall return
here eras meridie to see their effect, and
then I’ll tell you all the news of Ma­
drid.”
Saying this, he made another low
bow, and giving some directions neces­
sary to be observed towards his patient,
he departed, leaving Sebastian in a
state of mind not easily described, from
its alternate sensations of doubt, hope,
and fear. The idea that his sister yet
lived had instantaneously arisen with
the mysterious affirmation of the Dot-
tore, whose eccentricities were totally
forgotten in¡the emotions it caused.

Bapid in succession were his various
Feelings and conjectures; the mere
thought of Viola's recovery shook his
whole soul with undefiiiable sensations;
and then the consciousness of its almost
evident impossibility seemed for awhile
to suspend his every faculty; there was
in it something that more awfully and
forcibly impressed the senses, than
even the terrible certainty of her death,
and the conflict produced by such op­
posite ideas was nearly too agonizing
to be borne, A thousand times he
would have given them utterance,
would have execrated himself for allow­
ing any consideration to prevent him
from demanding an immediate explana­
tion ; but the impulse was ever checked,
when he reflected how soon the faint
ray of hope might be totally extin­
guished; in all the tortures of suspense,
(and of all mental sufferings suspense
is one of the most poignant,) rendered
doubly so by the restraint under which
TIIE ASTIt&rOGER. 279

it placed him, he was obliged to make
every effort to calm the perturbation of
his spirits, and, at all events, assume as
much composure as lie could $ to which
the implicit obedience the poor people
paid to the physician's orders, in leaving
him alone, m order that he might ob­
tain some repose, did not a little con­
tribute.
In the course of the evening Bertrand
entered with a small basket of medi­
cines, of no very tempting colour or
taste. Sebastian opened the first vial
that presented itself, and mechanically
swallowed the nauseous drug it con­
tained; in three hours afterwards he
repeated the dose, as directed, and ere
the hour allotted for the third had ar­
rived, he was buried m a deep sleep, in
which he continued until late on the
ensuing day—when, slowly awaking,
he beheld seated beside him ft the illus­
trious Genius of Physic,” who, having
congratulated him on the alteration for
280 THE ASTROLOGER#
the better which his draughts had pro­
duced, while his eager looks bespoke a
fund of interesting intelligence, at length,
with an air of gravity and importance,
to render it more impressive, turned the
conversation to the topic most wished-
for by Sebastian, which, to avoid tau­
tology, we shall give in the following
chapter, m our own words.

Puion.
O N the arrival of the bodies of the
Marcheze della Vittoria andhis daughter,
the catastrophe seemed complete ; for
the Princess had not yet been restored
to animation, notwithstanding the ex­
ertions of her attendants, and the skill
of Dottore Camphorio, who had been
immediately summoned to her and Don
Manuel d’Orellez. The respirations of
the latter were so short and faint, that
for a considerable time he appeared to
be gradually sinking beneath the cold
pressure of death.
282 THE ÀSTROLO0EÎI.
Such an accumulation of horrible
events as had marked the course of this
night, seemed almost indicative that
some inscrutable fatality hung over the
royal house of Spain, which had com­
menced in the dreadful and ominous
murder of 'Orlando ; and, too probably
would not end there; that suggestion
gave even a more terrific aspect to the
present circumstances, and soon be­
coming prevalent through the Palazzo,
it augmented the general consternation
to a/still'moïé •alarming,height.
The Veneration in which the Catholic
church is held by the Spaniards, and
theirimplicit belief in, and adherence to,
all its doctrines, needs hardly be told
to the reader; from the Prince to the
peasant the powerful influence of re­
ligion is manifested in their almost
¡every action, and the zeal with which
they fulfil the duties its tenets prescribe,
renders them jealous of every thing in
the least degree connected with them;
THE ASTROLOGER. 283
in then4 observance of them, there is,
however, a degree of bigotry, even
beyond the enthusiasm ofother countries
which embrace the catholic; faith. One
of their chief characteristics, and indeed
one most fatal tothemselves, is the ab­
surd confidence in the intercession of
saints, which almost all «classes acknow­
ledge, and to suchan excess has it some­
times carried, them, as to have been pro­
ductive of material injury.
History furnishesus with a remarkable
instance of the dire effects of their su­
perstition, in the losses sustained by the
companies of insurance ih the American
war, each company having its tutelar
saint, towhom they scrupulously allotted
a certain dividend, depending upon such
powerful associates for the success of
all their undertakings. In this blind
confidence they ventured to insure the
French West Indiamen at fifty per cent,
when the Dutch and English had de­
clined it on any terms, and the Conse-

quence was the ruin of almost all the
companies. So tenacious-do they seem
of the character theyhave thus acquired*
that their most violent passions, as if at
will, are in an instant calmed by,the
voice of piety and religion, nor can any
thing tend to excite those passions so
much as an offence against the church

Their indignation at the heinouscrime
of which the Conde Montalban had been
guilty, was therefore not confined to a
few individuals; almost every tongue
was loud m condemning him, and almost
all united, in declaring that, until the
chapel should have been purified by the
mosteminentclergy of. Madrid, it would
be unsafe for any of the royal family to
enter it.
When the first ebullition.of the shock
had somewhat subsided, and given way
to the deeper pangs of grief, the weep­
ing domestics assisted to convey, the
body of their beloved lady Viola to her

prepared for the occasion, to be ready
against the arrival of the Padre Jerome
fromthe convent of SanStcfano, whither
he had been sent for, as well to adminis^

family, as to say mass over her.
Meanwhile the Marcheze and Don
Manuel revived slowly, but their recol­
lection of what had passed was confused
and bewildered. Bottcre Camphorio
having prescribed some composing me­
dicines, andbeing assured that they were
completely out of danger, ordered that
they should not be spoken to, nor any
thing mentioned to recall to their minds
their lost Viola, after which he devoted
lus whole attention to the princess ;
having opened a vein, a copious flow of
blood, and a spasmodic heaving at her
bosom at length proclaimed that life
once more circulated through her; but
when she became sensible of every thing
around her, she continued for a long

time without speaking or moving, inso
much that her attendants again gre\i
alarmed. As if with one effort to plunge
herself and sorrows into oblivion, she
threw herself on the arm of the Abad,
and bursting into a violent torrent of
tears, she sank from a strong hysteric
fit into the same state of insensibility.
A loud bustle was now heard: m .the
courts below the windows of the prin­
cess's apartment; and when her senses
again:returned, one of the first sounds
that caught her attention was the Contie
Montalban’s name, pronounced in tones
prophetic of his doom, and without a
moment?s consideration she rushed over
to the window and heard the confirma­
tion of her fears.
«This dagger is Dorn Sebastians—
here is his name, and he is undoubtedly
the murderer’*
—cried a number of voices
atonce—" thevilest wretch—the broodi­
est assassin on earth (save Montalban,)

In vam the monk remonstrated with
her on the excessive indulgence of her
grief, and the ill effects it might perhaps
be productive of. Her tears still flowed
abundantly to the memory of her dear
Viola, and the destiny to which her
lover had been consigned—and Padre
Jerome, finding it impossible totranquil­
lize her, left her to the care of Dottore
Camphoric, and proceeded to the room
where lay the body of Viola.

kept her eyes rivettedon the pallid fea­
tures of her lady, would have been suf­
ficient to operate strongly onthefeelings
of the Abad, and call forth all his sensi­
bility—hot when he beheld the beautiful
countenance of Viola, over which was
yet spread a sweet and placid smile, the
internal monitor with all its doctrines
was unable to guard him against betray­
ing that it had forcibly appealed to his
feelings—and his cowl, falling back, dis­
covered the sympathetictearwhiclirolled
down his cheek, and bedewed her fair
hand as be involuntarily pressed it to his
lips.

the Palazzo was increased by the ar­

transport of delight, they had not hi­
therto imagined themselves capable of
feeling. The raptures of the domestics
were almost unbounded, and it was with
much difficulty they were prevented from
entering the roomwhere she lay, to tes­
tify their unanimous joy.
But their intrusion was strictly pro­
hibited by the medical attendants, who
were of opinion that it ought not to be
communicated to the Princess, the Mar­
chese, or Don Manuel, till they should
have acquired sufficient strength tobeai
without danger such unexpected and
happy intelligence.
With every branch of the royal family
Viola had always been a favounte, and
tlie attention shewn her on the present
occasion, the grief they had evinced at
her supposed death, and the unfeigned
pleasure they now manifested at her
recovery, gave her the most flattering
proofs of it.
Immediately on hearing that she
THE ASTROLOGER, 3
shewed syniptoms of returning life, the
Queen repaired m person to her apart­
ment, where she watched the progress
oi her recovery with solicitude almost
maternal, and a tenderness nearly equal '
to what she felt for the Princess her
daughter.
Not less anxious about her appeared
the King, from whom several messen­
gers came m the course of the night, to
make inquiries how she was going on ;
and he had each time the satisfaction to
learn that she still grew better.
But, notwithstanding all the pleasure
this circumstance imparted, sadness
again found its way to their hearts,
when they recollected the guilt of their
favourites the Conde Montalban,—the
fate tO'which he liad been condemned;
he who had been the beloved, the idol­
ized, of all who knew him, (except those
whose' envy his1superior qualifications,
and the1dignities they were rewarded
witty had excited,) was now a murderer,
b 2
4 THE ASTROLOGER.
his hand stained with a sister's blood:—
for though she had been thus provi­
dentially recovered, still his crime re­
mained the same.
What dreadful purpose could have led
him to such a deed it was impossible to
conjecture, much less determine. But
in the breasts of those whose sanctity
partook less of bigotry than others, re­
sentment for the crime soon gave way to
pity and compassion for the conse­
quences to him:—grief for the misery
into which he had plunged his family),
the blemish he had brought on his hi­
therto unsullied character, and the pro­
bability that they might never see or
hear of him again.
In this instance, however, the King
had determined to exert his influence at
the Holy Office to have Sebastian libe­
rated,—both in consideration of .the
eternal stigma his perishing in the Inqui­
sition would bring on the illustrious
House of Vittoria, and the high estima-

tion in which he, as well as every body
else, held the Marchese his father, ex-
elusive of the -partiality with which he
had ever regarded-the CJonde.
For that purpose he drove thither £t
an early hour on the following morning,
but Jtis impossible to conceive his asto­
nishment and dismay onhearing that the
object of his anxiety was nowhere to be
found.
This assertion he at first discredited,
recollecting that the Inquisitors had
- oftener than once braved even his au­
thority, and carried into, effect many
barbarous laws unsanctioned by him;
and fearful that they had now been no
less hasty or arbitrary, that their pro­
ceedings had been no less atrocious or
cruel, and that to those cruelties Sebas­
tian had already fallen a victim.
They had -made him their prisoner
without the royal authority, having ob­
tained immediate intelligence of the
transaction from the emissaries they

6 THE ASTROLOGER.
kept always employed to find out such
persons as were hostile to their holy
tribunal, or who had committed any
crime that came within the cognizance
of their laws.
In this, too, they had been aided by
the officiousness of several individuals
about the court, whose sentiments had
long been inimical to Sebastian; and,
without waiting for any decision from
the King, (who had been at one of his
country palazsos on the fatal evening
until a late hour,) they had at once hur­
ried him off.
His Majesty was, therefore, the more
incensed at it, as it appeared probable
that Montalban had fallen a sacrifice to
jealousy and private pique, both ofwhich
he knew never failed to pursue'the fa­
vourites of a court.
This idea drove him almost to mad­
ness ; and, it was with the greatest diffi­
culty the Inquisitors could convincehim
of the truth.
THE ASTKOLOGEli, 7
On entering the dungeon to summon
Sebastian to the tribunal'hall, amaze­
ment and consternation seized them ‘at
finding he was gone, nobody knew how
or whither.
A gust of Wind’ had fortunately blown
backthe secret door into its place, and
the'Heads of theInquisition, thinking it
was not known to any person besides
themselves, and confident1of the fidelity
of those to whom the keys of the prisons
were intrusted, did not for a moment

eluded, that one who could be guilty of
sueh enormities as murder, and so vio­
lent an outrage on the respect and re­
verence due to the Catholic church,
must assuredly be m league with some
infernal power; and consequently, as the
Conde could not have, fled without as­
sistance, that which had been rendered
to him was from some evil spirit, or in­
habitant of the nether world; nay, per­
haps from Lucifer himself.
Even within the sanctified bosoms of
these Holy Fathers,—these models of
rigid piety and virtue,—these reverend
, defenders of the church, did. this hor-
rible thought find a place; nor did they
scruple to communicate their belief of it
to the King, who shuddered with dis­
gust at such innate wickedness, and
whose mind education had happily too
much enlightened to allow him to be­
come a convert to this opinion.
Satisfied by their repeated assurances,
that Sebastian had by some means es-
THE ASTROLOGER. 9
caped the fate that threatened him in
the Inquisition, the King lost all re­
sentment in the idea of his favourite’s
safety, and his countenance fully dis­
played the satisfaction he felt. The in­
quisitors regarded each other in silent
amazement, and their expressive looks
declared what they durst not otherwise
avow: their indignation at his Majesty’s
incredulity, and the partiality he ma­
nifested towards one who had com­
mitted so flagrant an outrage against
their church.
Regardless of their chagrin, and his
thoughts occupied solely by Montaiban,
(for whose safety he again began to en-
tertain alternate hopes and fears) the
King returned; and the intelligence of
his flight was the only consolation his
friends at the Palazzo could receive.
The distressing state of suspense they
were m respecting him, considerably re­
tarded the re-establishment of Viola’s
health, and but for that circumstance

Providence had been so incontestably
evinced, that in the enthusiasm and'gra­

place, the Princess still continued firm

she bore—tiius to insult the Majesty of
Spam. Still in her bosom he had many
pleaders; through all the mazes of op­
position, difficulty, danger, and even
guilt, yet had his affection remained un­
conquerable.
If lovewere prone to philosophize, this
last extremity into which it had driven
him would have appeared an antidote to
all the rest; but so much are its sugges­
tions guided by sophistry, and yet so
obvious are its axioms, that the heart re­
ceives, while reason disavows them; and
though she regarded the crime with all
the horror it was calculated to inspire,
she could not help thinking that his at­
tachment to her was in some way con­

was as ardent as before: but though she
could not subdue it, she resolved at

all the dignity of her situation,—and if
Sebastian should return, to destroy (as
far at least as appearances could do so)
all those hopes she had hitherto so fondly
encouraged him to indulge.

“ Then whilst thou goest th' extremes offateto prove,
I'll share that fate, and expiate thus my love”
Pope
L i k e ' the sun, suddenly emanating m
glorious refulgence from the dark and
lowering clouds of winter, which with
resplendent majesty it hurls from the
face of nature, so had these joyful tid­
ings flashed through the gloom which
enveloped Montalban ; and so did their
re-animatmg brightness dispel for awhile
every trace of sorrow, and that despair
to which he had abandoned himself so
long.
The Dottore was fortunately too much
occupied in improving and comment­
ing on the facts of his narration, to oh-

serve the uncommon degree of interest
his auditor felt, and the different changes
of his countenance.
From this period the indisposition of
the Conde took a favourable turn; but
his mental and bodily health kept not
pace with each other. Every undertak­
ing at all conducive to the attainment of
his object, however formidable, had hi­
therto appeared feasible; but now hope
was no more; every possibility of ob­
taining Elvira seemed annihilated, and
retrospection was attended with every
pang that tortures the guilty mmd ; for,
alas, to what a dreadful extremity had
his chimerical pursuit now led him;—the
past was as a fantastic dream,— the wild
enthusiasm of fancy but the present
was no visionary scene,—it was indeed
reality ; and the recollection of his ro­
mantic passion, for onewhom fate had ap­
parently placed so far beyond his reach,
caused a momentary smile at its absur­
dity : while he regretted his weakness,
16 THE ASTROLOGER.
and determined to atone forit if possible,
by discarding the image of Elvira from
his bosom for ever.
Love has seldom aught to do with the
rigid ethics of a moralist; and when we
hearken to the sophisms of one, we are
usually deaf to all the doctrines of the
other. Of the truth' of this Sebastian
was, however, not an instance, for he
could love, and at the same time admit
every principle of reason and morality;
and though he found it impossible to
think of the Princess with any other sen­
timent* he resolved to subdue his hopes
and wishes of obtaining her,—for to both
did his truant heart sometimes yield,
according as reason told him, how futile '
and unavailing they were.
Supported in this resolution by reli­
gion and philosophy, he fancied he had
at last learned the government of his
heart* and feared not to inspect it; but
the soporific had nearly worn off,—its
emotions only slumbered, and required
THE ASTRQLOGEtt, 17
but the least stimulus to arouse them
again into action.
In the meantime, he was not so ab­
stracted as to be unmindful of his pre­
carious situation at present, and the ne­
cessity of determining what course he
should pursue. He shuddered at the
sickening thought, that home and friends
were now no more to him— (for of their
grief for him, and anxiety at that home,
he was totally ignorant) that at the very
moment when he most required the ad­
vice and consolations of the latter, he
must turn his back on his paternal roof,
without a prospect—without a hope—
-aud, alas 1 almost without a wish ever to
return:— an exile from all he held dear
on earth,—a wretched unfriended out­
cast, on a pitiless world, to whom he
durst not make himself known; and.
whither should he turn to seek that
comfort from which at home he had been
driven. How dreary- were the thoughts
of the future!
18 THE ASTROLOGER.
Never would the arms of a parent
again open to receive him. Never would
the sweet smile, to welcome him again,
beam on a sister's lips. And, worst of
all, never should'he‘behold Elvira; no
more assure her, that for her sake he
had thus braved every storm of adverse
fortune,—no more hear the magic' sound
ofher voice breathing forth ten thousand
rewards -in her promises of unalterable
.affection. For now all the avenging
powers of fate seemed combined against
him, Better, he thought; had henwaited
the stroke of death in'the Inquisition,
which would have ended all his wretch­
edness at once ;—but this wish was mo­
mentary; for what were all Ms present
sufferings, when compared to the dread
of a world beyond the grave.
Independent of other circumstances,
which interdicted his return, the idea of
again seeking protection or favour, or
evenof asserting those claims which na­
ture aad given him, from those whose
THE ASTROLOGER* J 9
hearts seemed to have been divested by
stern justice, of every feeling of huma^
nity, (for he knew not how undeservedly
he thus implicated his father in the. late
proceedings against him) was repugnant
to the magnanimity of his soul. And
miserable as Ins lot might thenceforth
be, he resolved to endeavour to make
peace with that God he had so wickedly
incensed, and bear with resignation and
fortitude the buffets of the world. The
consciousness of,having preserved the
native dignity of his character, and with­
stood the pressure of all exigencies,
amid the bitterest misfortunes, would,
he knew, afford; him a degree of conso­
lation, which nothing at the expense of
his pride could-bestow.
Fain would he have passed the rest of
his life m his present calm retirement,
contented with the peaceful society of
its humble inhabitants, and the .playful
endearments of the pretty Rosa to
cheer his melancholy hours.
20 THE ASTROLOGER.
But even that solitary pleasure he was
denied, as reflection shewed him the ab­
surdity of imagining that here he could
tranquillize his griefs, or that its seclu­
sion could afford security against inci­
dental ills; and, exclusive of that, the
mysterious light m which his doing so
would appear to the cottagers, and the
fear of the conjectures itwould naturally
excite, aided by the advice of his-ever-
faithful Bertrand, finally prevailed.
He had m his immediate possession
a considerable sum of money, besides a
large stock of valuable articles ofjewel­
lery, which had fortunately escaped the
search of the Inquisitors, and which he
knew would, when disposed of, produce
sufficient to maintain him and Ins sei*
vant, until revolving fortune shouldprove
more favourable.
After ruminating on various plans,
a journey to the interior of France was
ultimately fixed on, as the place most
likely to wean his mind, if possible, from

was not the u oblivious antidote” that
could “ rase out the -written troubles of
his brain/’ or “ pluck from his memory
its rooted sorrow.” And though society
was now irksome:to him, unfit as he was
to partake of its enjoyments, solitude
was more calculated to cherish than
dispel it. In solitude, indeed, he might
remain for ever concealed from that
world he resolved to abandon. But what
could conceal him from himself, or from
the all-seeing eye of an offended God.;
what could recal Ins former happy state
ofinnocence, without which the crowded,
city and the lonely forest are equally
desert,—the crowned monarch and the'
lowly mendicant ate equally wretched.
“ But,” cried he, clasping his hands to­
gether in all the fervour of confidence, m
the goodness of that great Power lie
addressed, “ repentance is ever accept­
able to thee, O God of mercv! Alike

^ It was-decided' that they should set
out as soon as his constitution should be
so'much strengthened as to be able to
bear the-unavoidable1fatigue of so long
ajourney, and, in the interim, he sought
the benefit of moderate exercise todnvi-
gorate him.
Thus had a month elapsed, and the
day named for his departure was to be
one’ of the ensuing week; Time had
much improved his health; and the de­
pression of his-spirits;' insomuch that he
could behold witlv composure the scene'

and part by clusters of small trees m

which it commanded a-fulL view, while
the adventurous Rosa clambered to its
exterior summit, which overlooked a
turning of the main road, to procure
some plants, whose gaudy blossoms had
immediately attracted her eye.
The, book that engaged Sebastian's
24 ASTROLOGER,
attention was a volume of Ariosto, into
one of whose sublimest passages he had
just entered, when he was roused by a
sudden ery ofjoy from the outside; and
the next moment Rosa had sprang from
the rovk, and thrown herself into his
arnte, almost breathless with rapture.
“ isthetimtter,m y sweetchild?”
inquired he, smiling sympathetically*

“ ^Ahf how, SenOr, I see you are
offended with me,” cried she, wiping
away her tears; *1
cbut if I had thought it
would vex you, I would not have asked
you at all,”
“ No, indeed, my little cherub, l am
not vexed with you,” replied he, gently
patting her head, and again taking the
hand she had withdrawn, “ and to con­
vince you, I will partly comply with
your wish, we will now Walk to­
wards the cottage, and while you go m
to save your grandmother the trouble of

shade of the trees beside it, where I
shall have a view of the ladies as they

“ Oh1 but you will see onlyone of
them, Senor; the other, who is, i am
sure, some very great proud donna of
THE ASTROLOGER 27
quality, always, remains m the eamage,
and grandmother says she must be some
rich Señora, at court I think she calls it.”
“ And do you not know the name of
your benefactress ?” asked the Conde,
the colour of his cheek turning alter­
nately from pale to.red.
The resemblance which, by Rosa’s
account, his features bore to those of
this fair unknown, and the mention of
the court, at once raised a conjecture
that it might be his sister.
The benevolence of Viola extended to
all the “ sons and daughters of indi­
gence;” and her charities were always
private, well applied, and without os­
tentation. Innumerable circumstances
tended, to strengthen this idea, and he
was on the point of stopping abruptly,
when the repeated entreaties of Rosa
again;shook, his resolution, and he went
on.
“ No, §enor,” answered she, we never
c 2
28 THE ASTROLOGER.
knew her name; and grandmother says,
too, that ’tis not for us poor folks to ask
great ones such questions.”
By this time they had reached the
spot where Montalban was towait; and
Rosa, requesting him to watch atten­
tively, bounded forward m a transport
of delight, and was in a few moments
beside Ursula, ready to hail their kind
visitor, with that hospitality which ever
characterized these generous-hearted
rustics.
At length he espied a female figure
winding round an acclivity at a short
distance, followed by a servant in the
undress livery of the Marcheze, his
father.
The Senora’s face was closely veiled
from his view; but her form and air,
and the attire of the page, left him no
longer m doubt. As if a mist had sud­
denly spread itself before his eyes, he
put his hand up to shade them; but
THE ASTROLOGER. 29
scarcely had he uncovered them, when
turning them full upon her, he had
merely power to exclaim, “ My sister!’3
and trembling, he sank against a tree
beside him.
Instantaneously she recognised his
voice, (for itwas indeed his sister,) andal­
most atthe same moment she pronounced
his name with a wild scream ofjoy. She
seemed falling to the earth; but Mon-
talban’s presence of mind quickly re­
turned. “ I am Sebastian,” cried he,
“ behold your affectionate brother once
more; and, springing from his conceal­
ment time enough to save her from
falling, he caught her fainting in his
arms, and bore her immediately to the
cottage, while the servant hastened to
the carriage, to procure a small bottle
of drops that lay in a corner of it.
The Princess Elvira sitting in it, with
a book which she appeared to be atten­
tively perusing, was startled at the coun-
c 3
30 THE ASTROLOGER
tenance of alarm the man wore, and de­
manded the cause, as she handed him
the drops from a little straw and gold
basket of Viola's,
“ So please yom Royal Highness,”
returned he, “ my lord, the Conde Mon-
talban has been found, and Donna Viola
has fainted at suddenly seeing him.”
“ Found! how, when, where? where
have you found him? where is lie
now?” impatiently she inquired, for­
getful at the moment of all ceremony,—
of every thing but Sebastian.
“ Near the old fisherman’s hut, your
Highness; and I believe he has fainted
as well as my lady, his sister.”
“ Shall I!attend your Highness there9”
continued he, seeing her motion to him
to open the carriage-door.
“ No/* said she, as she alighted in
visible agitation; and, taking the phial
from him, said she would go by herself,
as they were so near the cottage, and
THE ASTROLOGER. 31
desired him to wait with, the other at­
tendants beside the carnage until she
and Donna Viola should return.
In the delightful thought of again be­
holding- Sebastian, every doubt as to the
propriety of it vanished, and with a
beating heart she approached the humble
abode that contained him; and thus con­
taining all she held dearest on earth,
she viewed it with infinitely more plea­
sure, than she would have done the

tylontalban -was seated on a sort of
couch, made of rushes and dried sea*
weeds, supporting his sister’s head on
his b,o$om» and anxiously awaiting the
return of the servant, though Ursula had
good-naturedly administered one-of her
most valuable and efficacious cordials,
and to some purpose, for the colour was
slowly returning to Viola’s cheeks.
But the instant the angelic form o.t
Elvira met his wandering eye, his arm
dropped powerless by his side, and he
c 4
32 THE ASTROLOGER.
fell backwards on the couch, overcome
with the emotions her sudden and un­
expected appearance excited.
The Princess would have instantly
shrunk from his vacant stare, but her
feet refused to support her, and stretch­
ing out her hand to give the bottle
of drops to the astonished Ursula, she
averted her face, and took a seat to
prevent her falling.
What a painful variety of opposite
sensations did she experience at that
moment. Was this the reception she
deserved, or had expected, from Mon»
talban? How totally different was this
coldness from the warmth of affection,
which absence should, in her opinion,
have rather matured than diminished.
Could such a look of indifference be con­
strued into the rapturous expression of
lone? Was it for this she had made so
many sacrifices ? “ Oh Sebastian ! per­
fidious, inconstant, ungrateful being,”
thought she, “ no longer boast of the
THE ASTROLOGER 33
superior firmness, the superior virtues,
of thy sex ; too severe hath thine heart
found the test, which mine, with all its
female weakness, hath immutably with­
stood. Shame on thy dastard spirit,
thine ingratitude, thy perjury ! But no,
I will think of thee no longer, unworthy
as thou art; and should my heart's vital
current flow from the wound, I will tear
thine hated image from it for ever,'1
Viola was now tolerably recovered;
and the Princess rose involuntarily from
her seat, and was approaching her, when
another glance from Sebastian, who in
vain essayed to speak, transfixed her to
the spot, and she stood irresolute. Again
she looked; again met his silent and
melancholy gaze; a chilliness came over
her.
Ursula advanced with a respectful
air, though ignorant of the rank of the
illustrious lady, who honoured the cot­
tage with her presence; and, hoping she
would excuse such a liberty, she begged
34 THE ASTROLOGER.
an explanation of the mystery. But El­
vira, too much abstracted in her thoughts
to reply, and too much wounded by the
apparent apathy of the Conde to con­
tinue longer m his presence, hastily
walked to the door, where stopping for
a moment, she turned towards Ursula,
and requesting she would assist Viola
aftei her to the carriage, she proceeded
by the path-way to where it stood,
and, having ordered the roof to be
closed, she threw herself in, and burst
into tears.
“ I ivillforget him,” cried she; as if
gaining avictory over herself,— " against
the remembrance of him shall every
avenue of my bosom be henceforth
closed; or if for an instant memory,
spite of my efforts, shall recur to him, it
shall be with contempt and hatred, as
ileep-rooted as my love has hitherto
been firm and unshaken.” She was in­
terrupted by seeing one of the servants,
assisted by the Conde and Ursula, lead-
THE ASTJtOLOGEH. 3 #
ing Viola round the rock towards the
carriage.
The health of the latter was yet lan­
guid from her late severe illness; but
this unexpected meeting with a brother
so much beloved, notwithstanding his
faults, even his crimes, and whom she
had supposed lost to her for ever, had
so much agitated her whole frame, that
her delicate limbs now seemed scarce
able to support her.
Montalban accompanied her nearly to
the carnage-door, and his eye again
caught that of the Princess, to whose
cheek resentment had given an unusual
glow, and, darting a disdainful glance
at him, she turned her head aside just
at the moment that, forgetful of the
restrictions he had laid down for him­
self, and the impropriety of doingvso at
the present time, he was about to speak
to her, and apologize for the scene that
had passed at the cottage.
He now construed her embarrassment
c 6
36 T lir ASTROLOGER.
there into horror and displeasure at
again beholding him, and recollecting
how much cause there was for such
sensations, he could hardly blame her;
but he still loved her as fervently, and
was as captious and jealous of all those
trifles as ever. This slight, however de­
served, mortified him; it appeared a
plain proof that she wished to avoid him
altogether. He felt something like a
pang of grief for awhile at being thus
cruelly cast off by the one he so fondly
adored, and for whom he had suffered so
much; but he was angry with himself
for indulging it, and summoning every
spark of pride to his aid, his efforts to
appear unruffled fortunately succeeded
just time enough to prevent the secret
of his love for her from being divulged
to the astonished attendants.
Viola being seated m the carnage,
after parting from her brother with an
affectionate embrace, read at once in
Elvira’s countenance what was passing
THE ASTROLOGER. 37
within; and for a considerable time nei­
ther seemed to have power or inclina­
tion to speak.
She dreaded to mention Sebastian,
lest her doing so should oblige her to
revert to the late event, m which he had
been so deeply, so criminally concerned;
and she would, if possible, have entirely
obliterated it from her memory. But to
Elvira she wished to make him appear
less guilty,—less an object of horror
than she apparently deemed him, from
the repulsive frown with which she had
just turned from him*
“ Your Highness has of course seen
my brother/’ observed Viola, after a
long pause, “ and remarked how much,
how very much, he is altered for the
worse m his looks, and it was to me a
meeting as joyful as it was—Oh no,
’twas. misery—agony.”
" I have seen hib., ^enora,” inter­
rupted Elvira, “ I-have-seen the Conde
Montalban, and for the last time, I hope;
38 THE ASTItGLOGEfi.
but Viola, as you value my peace of
mind, you must never—never mention
his name to me again; I will see himno
more.”
“ That injunction is hardly necessary«
Alas! we have all too much reason to
fear that wc shall behold him no more.
He is going far, far away, where the
commiseration of his friends, and the
censures and revilings of his enemies,
will be alike unheard by him. His reso­
lution is, I fancy, now (and on the word
“ now” she laid a particular emphasis)
unalterable; we shall most probably lose
him for ever.1’
“ Santa Maria,” involuntarily cried
Elvira, the idea of his being lost to her
for ever instantly chasing away every
thought inimical to him, * surely you
are not, you cannot be serious. Don
Sebastian, I trust, has not formed any
rash design, nor would ungratefully fly
from the very ones who are his friends,
who will welcome and protect him. Is

he indeed ignorant of the 7£ing*s friend­
ship : and, possessing that, say what hath
he to fear?”
“ Ah, Donna Elvira, he knows all
this. But friendship is a poor balsam
to a wounded spirit such as his. He
is about to quit this kingdom, the
scene of all his happiness, and all Ins
misery; to choose a residence in some
foreign land, where congenial solitude
may in some measure tranquillize him.”
“ Impossible,” exclaimed the Prin­
cess, a thousand contending passions
almost impeding utterance; no, no, he
cannot be such a wretch. Hath he not
won from me my soul’s best affections ?
and would he hurl me to madness and
despair—nay, to destruction? Oh no,
he is not the villain you depict him ; oi,
if he did make the mad resolve, ’twas
prompted by jealousy. It was but mo­
mentary ; yet I deserve it; I alone am
to blame; ’tis I have driven him to this;
I will forgive him all. I implore you to
THE ASTROLOGER.
go back, and assure him of my unabated
attachment. Say I must see himthis very
evening by some means: that I amready
to fly with him to the remotest corner of
the earth.”
“ I pray your Highness be composed,”
said Viola, wondering at the inconsist­
ency of tins with her first declaration;
“ m the same moment you have con­
demned and absolved him; but ’tis, I
fear, to no purpose, although he loves
you as sincerely as ever; yet is he de­
termined to bid adieu to Spain, and—”
“ He dare not,” cried Elvira. “ Are
not our vows plighted to each other;
our vows of eternal love and constancy,
and are they not registered in Heaven?
Oh, do not sport thus W2
th me! Tell
him J am all his own. Tell him any
thing: but let me see him this evening
m the garden of the Palazzo."
The Princess would have ordered the
driver to stop; but the terrified Viola
prevented her by the assurance that she
THE ASTROLOGER. 41
should see him again; after which she
recounted their conversation in the cot­
tage.
When Elvira had left it, Montalban
felt relieved from the internal warfare
of his feelings the sight of her had occa­
sioned ; and on being sufficiently com­
posed to reply to his sister’s numerous
inquiries, he, at her entreaty, gave a
cursory detail of his late sufferings. He
recounted to her the various horrors he
had experienced in the Inquisition, his
miraculous escape and preservation from
it; mentioning also the mysterious agent
through whose means he had accom­
plished it.
She was deeply affected at his recital
of the sufferings he had endured from
his consequent illness and agitation of
mind. Nor was her gratitude less ex­
cited by his minute account of the kind­
nesses and attention shewn him by Car­
los and Ursula, whose hospitable cottage
42 THE ASTROLOGER.
had so long afforded him a secure and
comfortable retreat
The feelings which his fathers sup­
posed cruelty inspired, (for to such an
extent, as, he imagined, even a parent
had been led by a strict sense ofjustice,
he could give no gentler appellation,) he
scrupled not to reveal.
Viola was;shocked at hearing of the
mistake which had thus misled him—at
hearing her father censured for an act m
which he had been in no way a par­
ticipator.
Sebastian noticed not her look of wild
amazement, “ Oh,horrible! horrible!?
cried he, seizmg her hand, and inter-*
rupting her as she was about to speak,
“ to cast me amongst the demoniac dogs
of the Inquisition—unnatural, unpardon­
able ! Never again shall the Marcheze
della Vittoria see the son he basely,
inhumanly condemned to butchery the
most shocking. Even to thy tears,
THE ASTROLOGER. 43
Viola, must I deny this: I never, never
can consent to return.”
Now, she thought, was the happy mo­
ment to remove all his apprehensions
and doubts—to make him at once retract
the determination he had made; and the
shock that determination caused was
less severe than it would have been, had
not a probability appeared of easily
overruling and dissuading him from it.
Every objection—every remembrance of
the dreadful act he had committed, now
disappeared, m her anxious solicitude to
have him restored to that paternal home.,
which had a right to shelter him. She
no longer viewed him as the desperate
being, who had unaccountably aimed
at her existence an almost destructive
blow. She sought not an explanation,
which1might have more deeply wounded
her feelings; she forgot it altogether.
She looked on him, not as one whom
she ought perhaps to avoid and abhor—*
4 4 THE ASTROLOGER.
the recollection of it vanished m all the
generous warmth of sisterly love.
But in vain she tried to combat his re­
solution; he did not leave her long to
the indulgence of such a hope,—m vam
she represented the folly, the cruelty of
the step he meant to take,— the misery
it would occasion to his family.
Strenuously did she plead her father's
cause, and portray his grief and anxiety
concerning him, imploring him to return
and restore peace to their bosoms once
more.
But could his return have restored
peace to the bosom of either? No. It
was satisfactory, it was delightful to
him to know that his father, so far from
deserving his unjust opinion, still loved
him with undiminished affection, and
(guilty as he was) still wished for his
return, and would have given him such
a reception as Viola described. But the
circumstances that urged his departure
THU ASTROLOGER. 45
were of no common nature; and even
when Viola was most eloquently be­
seeching him to change his intention,
she felt conscious of the imprudence of
trying to persuade him, at least at pre­
sent, to return to Madrid, where public
opinion and report were so hostile to
him, and from which even the power
and favour of majesty could not shield
him.
On her knees she entreated him to re­
voke his sentence of voluntary exilement,
or at least to inform her of the place of
his destination; while she poured forth a
torrent of tears on the hands she clasped.
“ Inestimable sister,” said he, as he
raised her up, and folded her to his bo­
som,—

“ Indeed, my Sebastian, you distress
me, by reverting thus to things long for­
gotten,—by doubting my tenderness,—
by distrusting my assurances of your
safety, and my father’s love; the king,
too, is your zealous friend, and, there­
fore, what have you to fear ?”
To resist the pleadings, the tears of
a sister so amiable, so affectionate, was
almost as painful to Montalban as would
have been the ills he so much dreaded,
as the consequence of his compliance.
He knew that a parent’s love alone could
not constitute happiness; not:only that,
but self-approbation, and the good opi­

This interview presented a scene:the
most affecting; it was, however, unwit­
nessed by a third person, as Ursula had
with her usual thoughtfulness and dis­
cretion, retired with Rosa into another
room, while the Condeand his aster re­
mained m conversation.
All Viola's tears and importunities
proved unavailing; if any thing could
have moved Sebastian to compliance,
her affectionate endearments,—her soft
and melting voice,—her sobs, as she
hungon his bosom, must have done so.
But the die was cast; and rhe might as
well have attemptedto arrest the sun us

Viola could not but perceive, that to
urge him farther oai this subject would
but add to his:distress. His purpose
was unalterable, and die ai leagth for­
bore, conscious that many of the objeo

tions he made were indeed well founded,
and that at present, while the recent oc­
currence agitated the xnmds ofthe people
against him, he could by no means enjoy
that happiness she had promised him.
She feared that to encourage a hope re­
specting Elvira, would be leading him
still further into error.
From the time of his imprisonment m
the Inquisition, the Princess had studi­
ously avoided to mention him, and Viola
naturally concluded that she now saw
the folly and impropriety, nay, the
dangerof such an attachment, and had
accordingly made an effort to forget, if
not absolutely to abhor him. In this
respect she wished to deceive herselfs
almost contrary to the evidence of >her
senses, for Elvira was no longer the same
animated picture of health7'and loveli­
ness .as before; the colourbad forsaken
her cheeks, and an air of melancholy
prevailed in every thing she said and
did, which her family.attributed *to the
THE ASTROLOGER. 51
violence of the shock she had so lately
experienced.
Viola viewed with affright the dread­
ful precipice on which the House of Vifc-
-tona stood; for she saw, that if an union
between her brother and the Princess
were now to take place, its fall would
be the more tremendous; and though she
could not wish Elvira to regard him with
abhorrence, it was inconsistent with her
ideas of rectitude and prudence, and her
apprehensions for the safety of her fa­
mily; it was impossible that she should
not wish her to cease to love him. And
m supposing this to be the case, she
fancied herself authorized by the strict
-silence of Elvira with regard to him.
She felt that to raise a hope which she
could never wish to see realized, (even
should her doing so prove the means of
restoring Sebastian) would be a piece of
unpardonable cruelty; on consideration
there appeared a degree of selfishness
even in her wish to retain him, aware

* Viola was obliged to promise compli­
ance, and now rose to depart, fearful
that the Princess would be displeased
at being delayed so long.
Notwithstanding all the resentment
he had expressed towards Elvira for her
supposed perfidy, the idea that lie had
probably seen her for the last time, was
insupportable to Montalban, and almost
forgetting for awhile all his imaginary
wrongs, he determined to see her once
more, and accordingly exerted himself
to attend his sister to the carnage,
** Yes, spite of my better reason,

and Tis the only pleasure now left me;
I have steeled my heart against all
softer emotions,—for woman shall it
never again feel a pang. I may have
spoken of her too harshly and unkindly;
but«surely her unfaithfulness almost de­
served it all, and has at length subdued
my.fatal passion; yes, it has completely
annihilated it, and there can be no im­
propriety m my only seeing her, there­
fore will I go.”
Thus soliloquized Sebastian, while he
prepared to accompany Viola, who in
the; meantime had distributed the va­
rious presents she had brought for the
good' Ursula and her favourite little
Rosa.
Viola did not think it absolutely ne­
cessary to relate all the particulars ofthis
conversation; nay, there were some that
prudence and delicacy forbade her to
reveal. She could not so far wound the
pride and feelings of Elvira, as to men­
tion the severe and reproachful manner

in which Sebastian had spoken of her,
even should her doing so prove the most
effectual means of detaching her affec­
tion from him, and severing their hearts
at-once.
She therefore briefly informed her of
lus unalterable intention to exile himself
from the kingdom, beyond the reach of
either friends or foes; assigning as the
most plausible motives, many of those
he had already given, omitting, however,
all that might lead her to suppose he

her, as that was an idea she now wished
completely to put an end to.
She trusted, that the miniature being
returned, would be a sufficient evidence
of the change that had apparently taken
place m Sebastian’s sentiments, and also
effect a similar alteration in hers,
Impressed with this opinion, she soft­
ened her detail as much as truth would
allow.
On producing the picture, she ob-

change to a death-like paleness,, while
her whole frame seemed agitated, ,as if
she guessed that Montalban’s would be
demanded in return; and that kers was
indeed the unwelcome messenger that
proclaimed the cessation of his love.
Viola thought this emotion an omen
no way favourable to her hopes; but:as­
suming as much composure as possible,
she tried every argument that reason
suggested, tempered with all her natural
mildness, in general so persuasive, to
convince, her that virtue and propriety
exacted this sacrifice on both sides; and
that, influenced by those, her* brother,

tached to has name rendered him now
unworthy of her, had determined to sub­

ing with the appointment she had made
to meet him m the garden, on the follow­
ing-evening.
Now, indeed, were her pride and love
put to a test as severe as it was peremp­
tory and decisive. To 'receive such a
message;from Montalban, one of her fa­
ther’s subjects, upon whom she had con­
descended to bestow her heart, seemed
an humiliation almost too great to be
borne* To be thus slighted by one who
had in reality rendered himself unworthy
of her, was an insult that pride at first
would have^ led* her to resent. But a
stronger power, and more eloquent
pleader here interposed in his behalf,
and the arguments of love soon tri­
umphed over the sophisms of pride.
“ Methinks,” said she, endeavouring
if possible to appear calm and unembar­
rassed, and hoping the glow this con­
flictL
had given to her cheeks, would be
mistaken by Viola for that pride she
had effectually repressed ; " Methmks

in this affair, as well as m every other
where he is concerned, the Conde Mom
talban has acted rather precipitately,
perhaps rashly, but when reflection
comes to his aid, he will probably, too
late, regret this piece of ingratitude.
Be that reflection his punishment for the
loss of me. He knew I loved him,— and
yet in a fit of desperate heroism, a sense
of proprkty induced him to reject the
prize almost within his grasp,—and why,
—because, forsooth, it was the gift of
fortune, too great for even ins ambition
to expect,—because itwas offered,tqJus

,She ¡could dissemble no longer;—-the

tears trickled rapidly down her cheeks,
and she hid her face in her handker­
chief. “ Ah, Viola,” said she, sobbing
as she spoke, “ I cannot conceal my
real feelings; maugre all the dictates of
my judgment, yet will they shew them­
selves. Nature will not be controied
by art; and though my senses may for
awhile have been governed by the latter,
my heart hath ever remained the faith­
ful pupil of the former; yes, still is Mon-
talban dear to me as everr—still as fer­
vently beloved; and I find he is as ne­
cessary to my happiness, as air is to
our existence,— as inseparable from my
heart as goodness from the Deity.”
Viola’s looks sufficiently declared that
she was not prepared to hear such a
declaration, and she still held the minia­
ture, towards the Princess till the latter
declined taking it.
“ Viola,” said she, in a tone of dis­
pleasure unusual to her, at the same
time regarding her with a look in which
THE ASTROLOGER. 63
anger was predominant, “ this is cruel,
unkind, illiberal: *ti$ not the fn&ndshin
I have been hitherto accustomed tomeet
from you. Either my sentiments, not*
withstanding I have so plainly expressed
them, are to you unintelligible, or with
that perverseness, which is said to be
inherent m the female bosom, you would
crush my hopes of happiness in the bud,
though their growth e’en tended to pro­
mote your own; for would it not indeed
make 1you happy—would it not more
than gratify every spark of vanity that
ever dwelt m the breast of Vittona’s
daughter, to behold the brother she pro­
fesses to love united to the Infanta of
Spain, for whose hand there have been
already so many suitors.”
“ Neither vanity nor ambition, Prin­
cess, are amongst my failings,” replied
Viola, somewhat indignantly, " ivere
they, they could not have lain dormant so
long, flattered as they would have been
by your love for my brother.”
64 TUB ASTROLOGER.
' Elvira felt all the sharpness of this
involuntary retort; but, conscious that
her own severity deserved it, and that
gentler means must be used to bring
Viola to her purpose, m a softened ac­
cent, a tear yet trembling m her eye, she
continued:
“ How often have you told me, Se­
ñora, that you loved me as a sister—that
we were such, m all but the name—
-
that my friendship and happiness were
dear to you as life— would ever be so—
and yet liow different are your senti­
ments now. But this is, perhaps, too
severe a proof to put the fragile and in­
constant friendship of any of our sex to.
Upon yours I may probably have but
a slender claim; aud, therefore—*
*
“ Nay, Princess, you wrong me much,
manything that canreally constituteyour
happiness, I shall always most warmly
concur; and the strongest proof I can
give you that I do regard it, is by sacri­
ficing the gift thus offered me. This

proffered alliance would make you in­
deed sny sister; but to peace and hap­
piness then adieu for ever. On my head
would be the guilt; on yours the conse-
quences. Your royal house would be
overwhelmed with wretchednessand sor­
row ; the family of Vittoria in ignominy
and disgrace.”
Thus ended every hope of Viola’s ap­
probation or assistance in this affair. But
not so Elvira’s intentions; and, though
she deemed it necessary to the accom­
plishment of her plan to seem convinced
by them, all these arguments had been
entirely lost upon her.
The effort was, however, attended
with success; and even Viola was de­
ceived by the calm regret and resigna­
tion withwhich she promised to separate
the image of Montalban from her bosom
for ever.
“ I am now aware of the dangers you
have snatched me from, Senora/’ said
she, “ and yet with terror I behold ther

had been presented to her; but the mo­

The introduction had been brought
about by Bosa, whose beauty had first
struck Viola one day, as she was taking
an airing along the bankof the Manza­
nares, accompanied by the Pnncess; and
saw her sportively frisking about, with
a group of children of her own age and
size, but distinguished from them all by
the sweetness of her countenance and
vivacity of her manner.

number of those who already shared her
patronage and bounty, and intending,
should they hereafter prove worthy of it,
to take Rosa as an attendant upon her.
This proposal was approved by the
Princess—as few, indeed, were not that
Viola made.

these encomiums.
- “ Aye, Senor, that is what I was just

how or another, I think—that is, I fancy,

Ursula; ?

will remember it bye and bye.”
“ JTis some grand name at all events,”
said Ursula; " and, I am sure, she is

Still her curiosity remained unsatis­
fied, and her disappointment was visible,
as she related the manner m which she
had first attracted the notice of “ the
grand Señora*9
The introduction had been brought
about by Bosa, whose beauty had first
struck Viola one day, as she was taking
an airing along the bank*of the Manza­
nales, accompanied by the Princess; and
saw her sportively frisking about, with
a group of children of her own age and
size, but distinguished:from them all by
the sweetness of her countenance and
vivacity of her manner.
Viola was always partial to children,
but with this interesting littfe girl she
felt more than usually pleased, and,
with her accustomed philanthropy and

benevolence, determined to find out who
were her parents; in order, if they re­
quired it, to enlist them amongst the
number of those who already shared her
patronage and bounty, and intending,
should they hereafter prove worthy of it,
to take Rosa as an attendant upon her.
This proposal was approved by the
Princess—as few, indeed, were not that
Viola made.
On their return, they beheld the little
urchin on the summit of one of the
rocks—where, m all the gaiety of inno­
cence andyouth, she was merrily singing
and dancing foi the amusement of her
laughing, but less venturesome, compa­
nions, who stood below, applauding her
courage m having clambered to such
a height, while she viewed them with
proud exultation at the merit they al­
lowed her, alternately reproaching them
for fearing to imitate their leader, and
laughing at her own frolics as loudly as
any of them.
THE ASTROLOGER, 75
At first the'Princess and Viola could
not refrain from smiling at such a
sight; but terror was soon the pre­
dominant feeling,m their bosoms The
blushing Rosa suddenly turned round
at the noise ofthe-cavnage, and, abashed
at having her wild-gambols thus wit­
nessed by strangers—those strangers

pearance bespoke, (t folks of great qua­

nage, and conveyed home, whither she
was soon sufficiently recovered to point
out the way
Encouraged by their assiduity and
kindness, she replied to their questions
with hei natural frankness, giving an
artless description of Carlos and Ursula,
the manner m which they maintained
themselves and her, and concluded by
expressing her delight at the surprise
her grandmother would; be in at seeing
her m such a fine gold carriage with such
grand Senoras.
Already prepossessed in her favoui,
Viola was yet more pleased, on en­
tering the neat cottage of Ursula, to
whom she conducted the now-smiling
Rosa, and, after relating the circum­
stance that led her to it, and forcing
them to receive a small present, she
took her leave, pleased and interestc i
with her new acquaintances, thoughhum­
ble, and resolved to put her proposal m
practice.
THE ASTROLOGER. 77
From that time she continued to visit
and contribute to the comforts of these
poor people, carefully concealing her
name and rank—her only rewards (and
to her generous bosom the most grateful)
their benedictions, and the plaudits ofher
own- heart,
“ Don’t you love the S e ñ o r a de­
manded Rosa, again fixing her eyes on
Sebastian’s face. <f Ah! I am sure you

red, and looked as if she had been
weeping.”
“ Enviable little being/’ thought Se­

“ As iLhave done,” he was about to
add; he shuddered, and the words es­
caped'him not.
His meditations were here interrupted
by the entrance of Bertrand, who with
amazement observed the agitation visible
yet m his master’s looks.
Ursula cast an inquiring glance at
Bertrand, as if to read m his counte­
nance a solution of the whole mystery;
but the latter, having been mthe woods,
trying to procure a conveyance from
thence to the Pyrenees, as there were
several houses about the outskirts for the
reception of travellers, where carriages
and mules were often easily obtained,
was totally ignorant of the circumstance,
and could only conjecture that some-

thing untoward might have happened,
or the Conde had fallen^into one otrhis
usual fits of melancholy, ’
Sebastian, however, no soonerfound
himself alone with Bertrand,’ than he
informed him of the whole affair ; of all
he had already done, and fall ,he ,still
designed■; for, although Bertrand was
his sermnty he had ever found him a
faithful counsellor and a trust-worthy
Jriend. Nor did a false idea of supe­
riority, or a suggestion of pride,, prevent
him acknowledging it,
It was settled that m the evening they
should bid farewell to their present
peaceful abode, and proceed m disguise
to the grove at the eastern extremity of
the Palazzo, where Bertrand .should re-
mam until his master's return from the
garden,, «
At this period Carlos and Ursula had«

would ever be necessary for him to leave
them j-^and the sudden prospect of
losing* him (in all probability for ever)
overwhelmed them for a considerable
time in all the agony and bitterness of
gnef, to which there was no remedy.
In their parting scene, Montalban’s
heart was all sympathy; misfortunehad
softened it so as to leave it susceptible
to the slightest impressions of sorrow.
He had, indeed, felt 14 the whips and
scorns of t i m e a n d the unfeigned ten­
derness of those truly hospitable people

than would have been all the insincere
and insipid forms of polished life, or the
studied and varnished effusions of polite­
ness. He revered this venerable couple
with almost filial respect and fondness;
and he wept copiously as he pressed
their wrinkled hands to his burning lips,
while he endeavoured to stammer a fare­
well.
This excess of affliction was support-

uble until the lovely and innocent little
Rosa came running in, unconscious ot
what was going forward, and smiling at
the fanciful manner m which she had
adorned her lap-dog, which she play­
fully caressed as she approached, and
bade Sebastian admire it.
“ Ab, Senor, you are weeping, and
you know it will make me weep too,”
said she, as he averted his face; do now
take me in your arms, and tell me what
.u!s you; for, you know, I am fonder ot
you than of anybody else, except my,
dear, dear grandfather and grandmother;
and if ever you were to leave me, f
should die after you, and so should we
all.”

convulsive sobs.

He could articulate no more. Until
now he hacl,not known how much the

him.1 With one effort to tear himself
away, he put her into the arms of the
weeping Ursula, and Bertrand, having

The evening was serene, and the moon
rising majestically from a dark cloud,
threw her pale ¡and lucid rays ovei the

the plaintive bird of night mingled her
soft melody with the gentle murmuring
of the*water.. Every feeling->of Sebas­
tian’s bosom was soon in unison with
this sweet harmony of nature. All his
sorrows^-for awhile were tranquillized,
forgotten; the scene before hmralon'3
seemed to occupy his thoughts, and

by appointment, he was to waiifcntor

a rock to contemplate the beautiful pros­

siasm ; of a rich and glowing imagina­

of fancy could hardly have drawn.
Spite of all his efforts to forget her,
the Princess was <
■still the principal ob­
ject of his'thoughts,.from-which' she was
indeed almost as inseparable as he
was from hers. And though her late
behaviour made him believe that she was
no longer worthy of his love, he yet
found it impossible either to forget, 01
think of her without regretting that
there was no longer a hope of obtaining
her.
Severe, indeed, was the proof to which
his affection had been put; and still
more so it appeared now to lose her
But could it be otherwise after her in­
gratitude ; could he stoop to sue for a
heart which, having been withheld when
she might have bestowed it without a
blush, would surely now be demed him,
nay, was perhaps in the possession of

from his bosom—and though he had a
moment before been almost sorry foi
having returned her picture, and would,
if possible, have recalled the reproaches
he had uttered, he now congratulated
himself on his having done so. Then
suddenly raising his eyes in search oi
some new object to divert his mind
from one so painful, they rested on the
dark and ponderous walls of the Inqui­
sition.
An universal tremor seized him as lie
viewed this dreadful prison, and thought
of the wretched victims withm its in­
fernal dungeons, doomed to undergo the
cruellest tortures that demons in human
shape could devise—agonies infinitely
worse than death, and a tear of pity foi
their sufferings fell from lmn. But the
sensations ofhorror the sight of it caused
were soon lost in those of gratitude to
that almighty Being, who had so mer­
cifully interposed to save him from u

similar fate; and Ins whole soul ascended
in fervent prayer and thankfulness to
Heaven.
Bducalion, a long intercourse with
mankind, and a thorough knowledge of
morality and religion, had expanded his
ideas, and, of course, enlightened his
understanding But he was by no
means divested of all the superstitious
prejudices, which m those days gave so
strong a colouring to the characters of
his countrymen.
Supported m his opinions by various
illustrations from holy writ, v,and in­
stances he had himself seen of the mira­
culous power of God, he did not doubt
that supernatural agency was as pro­
bably employed ,by the Deity in his
dealings with men, as it was possible to
his omnipotence. Nay, sometimes he
scrupled not to aver what many so
strongly deny,— that there were m
reality such bemgs on earth as disem-
THE ASTROLOGER. 87
bodied spirits, concluding with the gene­
rally-allowed axiom—that “ to God a lt
things are possible.”
In this way did he account foi Ins
deliverance from the inquisition; and
when he recollected that, some time
before, the spirit of Ins mother had ap­
peared eithei to his waking or sleeping
laney, and the mysterious and awful
mannei in which he had been warned
against an union with Elvira, it seemed
the more likely* foi, that a friend 01
mortal mould could have existed for him
m the Inquisition appeared an absurd
improbability. Insensibly he forgot Ins
present situation,-—imagination trans­
ported lmn back to the peaceful scenes
ot Ins youth, the delightful shades ol
Vittona; beneath which, in the midst
of happiness and innocence, he so often
had wandered with Osmin, Ins early
friend and preceptor, unconscious ol
evil, and far from foreseeing the miseries
that fate had m store for mm.
88 THE ASTROLOGER.
“ O Osmin,” cried he, “ thou revered
and invaluable friend, who would have
guarded me from ill; how truly didst
thou foretel the dangers and vicissi­
tudes that have overwhelmed me since;
all, all hath indeed been fulfilled. The
malignant stai that watched my birth
still glimmers m the horizon with anger
ivnappeased,*—threats unabated. Much
I fear there is yet to come Misfortune
is one of those bequests of fate which
the longest life of man cannot exhaust;
alas! how hath it been lavished upon
me. Yet, Osimn, had I attended to thy
wise counsels, had I believed thy faithful
prophecy, nor exposed it to the mcredu-,
lity of my father, all this had not been,.
Had I not mistaken thy prediction tor

then—though misfortune had pursued

disbelieved, despised,— thyself spurned,
banished, forgotten. Oh, bask return
for thy paternal care of me ! But I did
not spurn, banish, or forget thee,—'twas
my father who------.'
He trembled at what his lips had al­
most pronounced; he recollected the re­
spect due to his father, and while it
silenced him, he dropped a tear to the
memory of the good Osnnn.
The vesper bell of an opposite con­
vent at lengthbroke onthe stillness of the
evening, and interrupted his soliloquy; he
turned his eyes m that direction. The
grey walls '6fthat abode ofinnocence and
religion were embosomed in a beautiful
grove of intermingled pine and ash, and
he could not help contrasting the hap­
piness its unambitious inhabitants en­
joyed, with his own sad and cheerless
situation. “ Such a life,” thought he, “ is
at least’ a passport to that happiness it
denies to many itself.”
A thousand painful remembrances

rushed on his mind at the moment; he
thought of the unwilling victim he had
consigned to the rigorous Monastery of
St. Marguerite's, and prayed aloud for
forgiveness to this only voluntary act of
cruelty he had ever committed.
“ But not on my head be the crime,”
said he; surety in the eye of Heaven
the Queen'alone is guilty; her threats
compelled me to a measure from which
my soul revolted. Be hers then repent­
ance and remorse as sincere as mine.”
He had long suspected/ though he
durst not impart that suspicion to mor­
tal, that the Queen hardly stood less in
need of repentance than himself; he was
well acquainted with what few, except
her own creatures, -had ever been able
to discover,—her Majesty’s real cha­
racter.
The mysterious accusation uttered
against tier by Donna Olivia, he had at
first attributed to malice and revenge,
prompted-by rage at the snare she had

been so unwarily hurried into, beyond a
possibility of extricating herself
But though he could not conceive the
nature of what she accused .her of, and
threatened to disclose, he was now of
opinion -that it was not entirely without
foundation; butywhatever it might have
been, he knew that it would remain
buried m oblivion, as lie trusted revenge,
or any other smful passion,' was no
longer an inmate of Olivia’s bosom;
The convent clock at length struck
nine, and^warned him to proceed1to his
appointment, as Viola was doubtless ah

heart he rose; he was about to hear

He lingered awhile; but soon shaking
off those ideas, he walked hastily on*
and found the garden-gate half open to
receive him.
Viola was slowly pacing an adjacent
walks.shaded on each side by tall um­
brageous trees, anxiously expecting him.
Her face was still clouded with melan­
choly, and her eyes dim with tears, vi­
sible by the pale light of the moon, whose
rays at intervals penetrated the foliage.
Taking her hand he led her to a
seat, and gazed on.her pallid features
for awhile with inexpressible tender­
ness, At length recovering from »his
emotion, which he saw only tended to
increase hers, he ventured to ask for

bring about an interview between you;

can be nothing to apprehend from it.”
Tins sentence inflicted a blow that
struck coid to Sebastian’s .heart “ Yet
why,” thought he, “ should I feel vexed
or disappointed? what is there m tins
that X was not prepared for?'Surely it
has neither destroyed nor given rise to

After conversing for awhile on srib-

jccts interesting' to themselves, Ins sistei
proposed to conduct him to where the
Princess waited, and, his bosom heaving
with different emotions, he silently ac­
companied' her.
A long dark walk brought them, after
many windings, to a bower of inter­
mingled orange, jessamine, and rose-
trees, around which were several par­
terres of the rarest and most beautiful
flowers, clad in all the gay colouring and
rich luxuriance of the season, and pour­
ing alt their sweets upon the surround­
ing atmosphere.
Within -its fragrant shade the light
drapery of Elvira floated on the breeze;
its hue of solemn black, partially silvered
by the moon-beams, seemed to impart
to her sylphid form even more than its
usual loveliness; while its soft and me­
lancholy gloom was finely contrasted by
the smile that involuntarily stole over
her features as Sebastian entered; never
perhaps, in all the glowmg charms of

perfect health and liveliness, had she
looked so.truly interesting,—so bewitch­
ing as at this moment.
Montalban felt the influence of such
a look, (though unintentionally); instan­
taneously he forgot all her supposed in­
gratitude, and sank at her feet.
All nature appeared to stand still, as
if expecting a tender reconciliation be­
tween them. But Elvira quickly recol­
lecting herself, and alarmed lest Viola
might have witnessed this scene, in a
voice of assumed firmness, bade him
arise
The tone in which she pronounced
this command, and the resentful look
with which it was accompanied, would
have discouraged any one less warmly
devoted to her. He forgot every part
of his assumed character, and snatching
her hand,— " Elvira,” cried he, “ such
mockery is ill-timed,—Heaven knows I
have been long enough the sport of foi-
fcune-; and is it for you to dally with me

thus, or trifle with my present feelings?
— No, no, say at once you loathe and
detest me,—and you behold the object
of your aversion no more; with one de­
structive word annihilate every hope—
cast me off for ever; any thing 1 can
bear, but this refinement of cruelty.”
“ Consult your own heart, Conde,”
replied the Princess, “ and you will find
that you are no longer entitled tc—

his meaning,—" Giesu Maria! what fresh

continued she, the severity of her voice
relaxing into all its natural gentleness,—
“ who do you think could have rivalled
you in my affection ?sî
The emphasis on the word could,
seemed to act with the force of electri­
city ; the expression of his countenance
changed instantly to that of joy, but
againit varied.
« Alas,” thought he, “ where is the
woman whose vam and inconstant heart
will not admit competitors ; words, are
mere deceptive sounds. Yet surely, El­
vira,” he suddenly exclaimed, “ Î may
believe thee,—that angel face would not
speak what the heart did not feel,—you

“ Hold, Senor,” said she, interrupting
him, " I conjure you to explain your

tell me all; much is there to be ex­

“ A few words‘ then, my Elvira, will
suffice to enc our doubts and suspi­
cions,” said Montalban; and seating hitn-
self beside her, he gave a brief sketch of
the late events, and the circumstances
that had led to them.
On the culpability it threw upon him
she forbore to offer a comment; but as
it was necessary to elucidate the affair
so far as it concerned herself, she ad­
dressed him with an air of reserve, while
offended pride darkened her brow, and
contradicted what her words had before
implied

A deadly paleness superseded the

violently, and seemed scarce able to

every feature. “ Yet wherefore these

*
*Hear me, Elvira, as you hope for
heaven/3 cried Montalban, flinging him­
self before her, and catching her arm in
all the wildness of despair;—“ hear me
lor an instant, nor condemn me thus
hastily to destruction. Alive we must
never part,—never. Can you,—dart you
forget our plighted vows,—have you
forgotten that 4Eve of San Sebastian/
when, beneath the convent's holy walls,
we swore to each other eternal fidelity;
—swore, that as we were born, so would
we live and love together? Remember
them now, thou traitress, to all those
sacred pledges, and shudder at Lie re­
flection that your violation ofthemwould
have hurled you-into the deepest abyss
of perdition,—yon are mine for ever,—
even in death would I secure you;—re­

dagger shall send oar souls together, to
tell the reward of faithless love and per­
jury.”
This terrific appeal seemed for some
moments to have stagnated the blood in
Elvira’s veins, and suspended every fa­
culty ; but soon recovering, she snatched
the dagger from his yet uplifted hand,
and dashed it away.
“ Sebastian,” said she, “ the hour to
which fate has limited our misfortunes
is, I trust, at length arrived;—deception
is now no more;—that I have put your
love for me to such a proof was preor­
dained when destiny cast the horoscope
of our eventful l i v e s a n d thus have its
decrees been faithfully fulfilled';—say
that you will live for me,—love me,—fly
with me,—protect me, make me your
wife, and I am yours. No earthly power
shall again divide us.”
The rapid transition from despair to
joy was too much for the almost ex­
hausted spirits of Montalban, and it was
THE ASTROLOGER, 105
long ere he was able to utter a word
He caught her to his bosom, and tears
proclaimed his feelings more eloquently
than words could have done;—tears
such as he had never shed before The
rapture he experienced at this moment
seemed to more than counterbalance all
his sufferings, and in the fulness of his
heart he sobbed, Oh Elvira, beloved of
my soul,—who would not suffer all I
have undergone, to be thus rewarded by
the richest treasure earth could boastof.”
The looks of each proclaimed the hap­
piness they felt, and not a thought to
damp that happiness for a considerable
time intruded;—the nightingale seemed
to have ceased her warbling, and the
moon to have veiled herself in the slowly
passing clouds, as if ashamed of being
thus surpassed m loveliness, for they
looked indeed the loveliest of nature's
works.
A slight rustling amongst the branches
f 5
106 THE ASTROLOGER*
startled them; it was caused by the en­
trance of VioIa> and terror at the proba­
bility that she had overheard them, had
nearly thrown them off their guard*
This alarm was momentary, but it was
succeeded by one of a more serious na­
ture. Viola’s manner convinced them
of her being totally unacquainted with
the conversation that had passed be­
tween them, and the reconciliation that
had taken place, But with a counte­
nance indicating some danger at hand,
she informed themthat she hadjust seen
the King, crossing one of the walks at the
opposite extremity of the gardens, who
would probably seek the Princess in her
favourite bower, and discover Montal-
ban if he delayed there longer
Each was aware, that to the Conde,
the consequences of such a discovery
would be fatal , or at all events would
draw on him the severest displeasure of
his Majesty, who they did not doubt
THE ASTROLOGER. 107
would also evince at towards his family,
by entirely withdrawing from them his
tavour and friendship.
Though the King was now, so warm a
friend to
rthe house of Vittoria, they knew
he was too tenacious of his regal dig­
nity,—too conscious of the respect and
homage due to royalty, to suffer such an
affront to go unpunished, as a subject’s
presuming to address Ms daughter in
the language of love.
Elvira saw, too, that in giving way to
the natural feelings of her heart, in lov­
ing Montalban, and disavowing those
sophistical ideas of superiority and dis­
tinction, she yet was acting contrary to
her duty, and infringing the circum­
scribed bounds which the painful forms
inseparable from her high rank pre­
scribed to her actions. For Montalban,
though ofnoble and illustrious birth, was
still a subject, and as such she knew
their laws would not sanction his union
with her* But the laws of nature, had
f 6
108 THE ASTROLOGER«
sanctioned the union of their hearts,.and
she determined to appeal to no other.
Elvira felt conscious, (and Viola’s
looks shewed that she also thought so)
that in thus meeting Sebastian alone,
there was a degree of impropriety and
indelicacy, inconsistent with the charac­
teristic modesty of her sex.
.. But she soon found an excuse for this,
on reflecting, that had she not done so,
Sebastian would have been lost to her
for ever.
But how soon, alas, might they now
be separated, and that too, to meet no
more.
After they had apparently overcome
everydifBeulty, impediment, and danger,
had thus nearly attained the summit of
their wishes, to be tom fromeach other,
even at the blissful moment of reconci­
liation, was m idea more dreadful than
all the sufferings they had hitherto un­
dergone.
To avert the threatened blow required
THE ASTROLOGER. 109
all their fortitude and presence of mind,
as nothing could do so but immediate
flight; but to this the presence of Viola
was an obstacle not easily removed—for,
trembling for their safety, she still con­
tinued urging her brother to retire with­
out delay, and the Princess to return
instantly to the Palazzo, lest the King
should come that way, and notice her
agitation.
Dissimulation and stratagem were now
necessary, as all depended on them,
but they knew not how to get Viola
out of the way without exciting her sus­
picions.
The Princess drew her veil closely
over her face, and assuming an air of
coldness and reserve, the better to de­
ceive Viola, (though her mind was a
stranger to deception, and under any
other circumstances she would have re­
volted from it), she bade Montalban
farewell, at the same time giving back
110 THE ASTROLOGER.
her own picture (which Yiola did not ob­
serve).
«
« Here, Conde,” said she, “ take back
this once-valued gift, and from this mo­
ment let all remembrance of our impru­
dent love, with that love itself, cease.
Adieu1 if you regard your safety, you
must immediately begone.”
Montalban perfectly understood her;
and putting up the miniature hastily.
“ Princess,” replied he, “ your wishes I
hold sacred, they shall be obeyed, i
will endeavour to forget you, or if m the
dreary solitude where I shall spend the
remainder of my days, I should for a
moment think of you, it will be with self-
reproach for having presumed to aspire
to a heart destined for some one more
fortunate, more exalted, more happy,
and more deserving than I am.”
With these words he moved from her,
as if about to depart, when (as they had
expected) Viola bade him stay for a few
THE ASTROLOGER. H i
moments, while she went out on the
walk to ascertain whether there was any
danger of the King’s coming in that di­
rection, and the nearest path by which
he could get out of the garden, without
being observed by his Majesty.
This was the wished-for opportunity;
without it, all their promised happiness,
all their plans, had probably been marred
for ever and for ever had they been
separated
4t Oh * what a weight of dreadful
doubts and fears am I now relieved
from,” cried the impatient Montalban,
“ for the first time in my life i felt my
sister’s presence torture nearly insup­
portable. But she is gone; let us seize
this favourable moment—instant flight
alone can prevent our being now sun­
dered, Oh! if you would not see me
die, (for I will meet death sooner than
voluntarily resign you,) let us instantly
away. We will take the most private
path through the gardens, and, when
112 THE ASTROLOGER*
we have reached the wood beyond them,
we shall find all in readiness to bear
us hence. Then, Fate, I set thee at
defiance.”
icNay, Conde, be not thus precipitate;
such a step would entirely defeat its
object But, fear not our being sepa­
rated ; henceforth to oblivion I consign
all the irksome grandeur and pomp of

must dissemble before Viola, and suffer
her to conduct you from the gardens.

Elvira had merely time to reply, " In

entered, and beckoned her brother to
follow her, and, glancing significantly at
the Princess, he obeyed.
Viola now became violently agitated.
Till this moment the agonies of a parting
interview had been almost forgotten m
her apprehensions for his safety; but
now that she was about to lose her be-
* loved brother, perhaps for ever, all her
strength and fortitude forsook her, and
bursting into a torrent of tears, she sunk
on one of the benches, having merely
power to point to a path that led to the
gate by which lie had entered, and with
an almost inarticulate " Farewell,” bid
him hasten to escape, or he might be
overtaken by the King.
At first he could not resolve to leave
her in this state, though aware that
every moment was replete with dangei
to him; and, approaching with a look
of grief and tenderness, he tried to
comfort her by the assurance, that if
THE ASTROLOGER. 115
hereafter any circumstance should arise
to induce him to return, he would cer­
tainly take advantage of it.
But she, knowing the risk he ran in
delaying thus, and it only tending to
increase her uneasiness, waved one hand
as a sign to him to be gonej while
with the other she covered her face,
endeavouring if possible to smother her
sobs.
Sensible that in remaining here he
hazarded his life and honour, and (what
was as dear to him) that of the Princess,
he took a last embrace of the amiable
Viola, and hurried from the gardens.
He found his faithful servant at the
place of rendezvous, and confided to him
all that had passed, as liis assistance
was yet most essential to the accom­
plishment of their plan.
On the borders of the - wood was a
house of accommodation, whither tra­
vellers resorted from all parts of the
kingdom, and there Bertrand had en-
116 THE ASTROLOGER.
gaged a carriage and mules returning to
France.
The driver was a native of that
country, and understood very little of
the Spanish language, but sufficient to
enable him.to understand the offer of a
considerable bribe, he-would preserve
inviolable secrecy, relative to the pas­
sengers he-was to take across the Py­
rénées.
This he evinced ,no great reluctance
in accepting ; and accordingly promised
Bertrand to be at an appointed spot at
ten o clock, where he would await his
coming.
The Conde highly approved of all that
Bertrandhad done, and committing to his
care a few small packages, containing
clothes, papers, &c., he sent him imme­
diately to wherethe carriagewaswaiting,
there to remain until his arrival with
the Princess.
Montalban now recollected that, m
his hurry and agitation, he had forgotten
THE ASTROLOGER 117
to fix with Elvira any particular place
for their meeting; and this circumstance
perplexed him not a little.
There wasi however, no remedy but
to wait in that part of the wood nearest
the gardens, as it seemed probable that
she would come that way in preference
to a more circuitous one.
He counted almost every moment that
intervened; never had an hour appeared
so tedious: he listened for her voice in
every murmur of the wind—looked for
her shadow as the branches were gently
agitated to and fro; and at length, as
the convene bell proclaimed half past
tbn, a tall figure, in the distant per­
spective, closely muffied and veiled, ap­
proached with cautious steps, as if fear­
ful of being overtaken and detected ,
and in a few minutes he was joined by
the Princess.
“ O Montaloanl” said she, “ what a
risk have I run.—what dangers have I
braved—and all, all has been for you.”
118 THE ASTROLOGER,
«
* This is, indeed,” replied he, " a
proof of your love I nevei shall forget,
to venture thus alone, exposed to the
breeze of night, and the dangers of this
solitude. Surely for such a proof, the
services of my whole life devoted to you
would be a poor, a trifling compensation.
Elvira, my heart, ipy.snui sha'l------”
“ Oh! let us instantly hence," she in­
terrupted; “ on this subject we will talk
more opportunely. I tremble to think,
that even now we may be pursued; and
should it indeed be the case—should
we be taken, our fates would be most
direful.”
They now hurried into the thickest
part of the wood, whose dark labyrinths
at this unseasonable hour would have
appalled, any hearts but theirs. They
were, however, insensible to every other
danger but that of being overtaken in
their flight, by people sent .in search of
them, and separated.
They were both so completely dis^
THE ASTROLOGER. 119
guised, as to render it almost impossible
to recognize in their persons the Conde
Montalban or the Princess Elvira; and
when they had reached the place where
the carriage was waiting, their rustic
appearance made them almost escape
the observation of the muleteer, who,
with the politeness that distinguishes his
country, merely making an obeisance,
which lie always considered due to-his
superiors of whatever rank, received
their orders, and mounted one of the
mules while Bertrand got on the back
of the other, after having handed his
Lord and the Princess into the carnage
A mutual intimacy was soon formed
between Bertrand and his new compa­
nion, Jacques, whose shrewd observa­
tions soon informed him, that he guessed
our travellers were a pair of lovers m
disguise; but who, or of what quality,
they were he«appeared to be totally ig­
norant.
■Bertrand was at first much alarmed,
120 THE ASTROLOGER#
and tried to convince him to the con­
trary ; reminding him, at the same time,
that such remarks were inconsistent with
his promise of secresy; but, though
Jacques had too much penetration and
cunning to allow him to be deceived,
and credulity was by no means one of
his characteristics, he nevertheless pos­
sessed a heart, whose excellent qua­
lities would have dignified the most
exalted rank; and his fidelity, when
once won, was not to be shaken. Ber­
trand’s apprehensions were, therefore,
soon at an end; and they continued
their journey as comfortably as the cir­
cumstances that rendered secrecy sone­
cessary would allow.
Sometimes the steep descent of the
glens enveloped themin awful-darkness,
and then, as they suddenly arose, the
pale luminary of the night, whose mellow
rays faintly tinged the woody heights,
served to light them, until having gamed
the extremity of the wood, they found
121
THE ASTROLOGEJR,
themselves about four leagues from
Madrid.
Here they stopped at a small village
to procure some refreshment; and it had
been agreed that the ceremony should
here take place, which would give Mont-
alban a lawful right to protect his adored
Elvira, in the sacred character of a
husband.
It was now midnight, and most of the
peaceful inhabitants of the village had
long retired to repose; and, although
there was a convent of Monks near the
house where they had alighted, they
feared that to disturb the silence of the
holy retreat, or summon one of the bro­
therhood for such a purpose as that of
performing the marriage rites at so late
an hour, would excite suspicion, and
probably give a clue to their pursuers
on thé following day.
Each was aware of the impropriety of
its being, longer deferred. Montalban

He would have indulged his propen­
sity for talking to a much greater length,
had he not been interrupted by the
Conde, whose anxiety was increased by
a circumstance so favourable to his
wishes, in compliance with which he
repaired instantly to-summon the Padre
Alfonso.
He quickly returned, accompanied by
the Abad, a short fat man, who did not
look as if he thought abstinence one of
the virtues compatible with his holy
profession—as he, in truth, bore very
little of the appearance of a Monk be­

T H E malice of fate seemed long since
exhausted; in dividing Montalban so
long from all his heart held dearest on
earth, it appeared to have done its
worst: but now, in possession of Elvira,
the adored object of his affection, he
thought on the past but as a dream, and
defied the power of destiny to hurt him
farther.
He wa?< sensible to little more than
what he at present enjoyed; he forgot
for awhile even the guilt that almost
g 3
126 THE ASTROLOGER
constantly tortured him, and fancied his
happiness complete. He even now
blamed himself for having allowed the
prophecy of the Monk'Osmm to give
him a moment’s uneasiness, wtien all
the Astrologer had foretold had been
thus overcome, every obstacle had been
removed, and he had attained the sum­
mit of his desires.
He smiled oil recollecting the appa­
rently belied prediction of the latter,
« that he (Gsmin) was ordained to be
the messenger of joy and happiness to
him, and that he alone could be instru­
mental m bestowing them.”
True, the first part of hs prediction
had been verified. Many sorrows had
indeed been allotted to Montalban, and
he had experienced them« But surely
Osmm had m no way contributed to the
felicity of the present hour; he had not
given him Elvira; the idea was prepos­

vent of San Sebastian ; from which pe­
riod every individual of that holy com­
munity scrupulously avoided mentioning
his name. From this mysterious cir­
cumstance many conjectures, unfavour­
able to his father’s fame, arose, and
it seemed probable, that the ill-fated
Astrologer was no longer an inhabitant
of this world. Such a conclusion was
natural ; and thus was the failure of the

their host, and his friend, Alfonso the
Monk, that in their tour France was to
be included.
We must now bring them forward on
their journey, and introduce them to the
reader under their new titles of the
Conte and Contessa Vicenza.
Jacques was well acquainted with all
the private roads; and, being not alto­
gether ignorant of the secrecy a clan­
destine love-affair requires, the natural
goodness of his disposition led him to
feel too great an interest in the happiness
of our travellers, of whose generosity
he had had many proofs, to neglect any
of the requisite precautions for their
safety. His guidance, therefore, brought
them in perfect security to France,
where, on being dismissed, he was most
liberally rewarded,
The charms contained in every part
of this salubrious and beautiful country
amply compensated them for the fatigues
of their long journey. Luxuriant land-

scapes, alternately hill and dale, wood
and water—the sweet serenity of the
atmosphere—every thing that could de­
light the heart, and fascinate the eye,
hailed their arrival, and was admired
with the highest degree of enthusiasm.
They chose their retreat in a retired
and romantic part of the province of
Orleans; and, could they have thrown
the veil of oblivion over past events,
they had now indeed enjoyed all the
happiness apportioned to mortals.
They were, however, m possession of
every domestic comfort to be derived
from their affection for each other. Tile
cultivation of the talents with which
Heaven had gifted them, and the exer­
cise of the virtues it had enjoined, added
to the society of a few select acquaint­
ances, resident at a short distance from
their little villa, and the cheerfulness and
tranquillity these pursuits imparted,
prevented them, for a considerable time,
g 5
130 THE ASTROLOGER.
from being objects of particular observa­
tion or curiosity.
Time, instead of diminishing, seemed,
if possible, to augment their love. But,
alas1 they found that mutual love does
not always give birth to mutual hap­
piness.
There wen moments when they were
relieved from obtrusive remembrances
of the past, and absorbed in the transi­
tory pleasures of the present, and the
contemplation of the harmony by which
they were surrounded. But when these
evanescent charms gave way to retro­
spection, how sad was the contrast—
when conscience, stung,by the most ago­
nizing reflections, the most horrible of
crimes—murder;— a guilty conscience,
that corroder of our tranquillity, burst
suddenly forth m all .its horrors amid
their short-lived joys, then, indeed, was
the Conte completely miserable.
They had not betrayed to anybody
THE ASTROLOGER. 131
their real rank or titles; and, being
obliged to be constantly on their guard
against a discovery, at length became
so irksome, that they agreed mutually
to rosum to Spam, make known all at
the feet of the King, and trust to his
characteristic clemency, and the love
hebore hisdaughter Elvira, for pardon—
any hazard appearing preferable to re­
maining longer m a place, where cu­
riosity-had-now fixed its prying eye on
them, and marked them as victims of its
insatiable appetite.
Their assumed title of Vicenza had
been for many years extinct, and had
belonged to a distant branch of the
family of Vittoria, then governing a small
principality m the Italian states; and the
non-existence of it being proved, gave
rise to suspicions, that circumstances of
nocommon nature compelled themto the
concealment of their names; and that
Italy had been their birth-place most
people in reality discredited.

132 THE ASTROLOGER.
About this time, too, the consternation
and disorder that the Infanta's flight had
caused at the court of Spain, was talked
of throughout France; consequently,
with all the occurrences that had since
taken place there, our hero and heroine
were perfectly acquainted.
On the night of the Princess’s elope­
ment her absence had been unnoticed
until a late hour, when her not return­
ing excited the most dreadful alarm.
She had been accustomed to enjoy the
evening air m the gardens of the Pa­
lazzo, beneath whose delightful shades
she often wandered for several hours,
either accompanied only by Viola, or
entirely unattended—the atmosphere-m
that warm climate being generally too
oppressive before sun-set to allow her
to walk, an exercise she was particu-
kily partial to. The gardens were, on
all sides, enclosed by high walls, and
each of the gates was opened by a key
of peculiar construction, only in the pos-

session of the royal family, and a few
high personages of the Court ; so that it
was impossible for a stranger to gain
admittance, unsanctioned by them.
Thus secured from intrusion, there
appeared no impropriety or danger in
those solitary rambles; and Elvira was
left free to the indulgence of her favourite
amusement.
Immediately after Montalban had left
her, she had repaired, privately and un­
observed by any of her ladies or attend­
ants, to her apartment, where, with all
the haste her plan required, she collected
her money and most valuable jewels in
as small a compass as possible., after
which she proceeded with the same cau­
tion and privacy to the wood, where she
had consented to meet Montalban.
When the Princess walked out alone,
her retirement was seldom intruded on ;
butat length, her protracted stay causing
surprise and apprehension, several of
her attendants went in quest of her
134 TIH3 ASTHOLOGEll.
through the gardens. Tlieir search was,
however, in vain* their calls and la­
mentations were unanswered, except by
the shrill echoes amongst the trees; and
with countenances full of horror they
returned to the Palazzo, to tell the
dreadful tidings that the Princess was
no where to be found*
A scene of consternation that baffles
description, ensued ; to the Queen the
effects of the shock were nearly fatal,
and the grief and distraction of the King
at the loss of his favourite daughter,
were such as he had never before known
Whither, with whom, or for what cause
she had fled, they could form no pro­
bable conjecture, till V.ola, (who was
known to have been with her) ,was ques­
tioned minutely on die subject by hei
father, and to evade those questions,
without an actual dereliction frem truth
was impossible.
Falsehood had ever, been a stranger
to the heart of Viola ; and as soon as the
THE ASTROLOGER. 135
Princess was missed, her suspicions in­
stantly rested on Montaiban as the sole
cause and companion of her flight.
Notwithstanding her affection for hei
brothei, she could not help feeling the
highest degree of resentment against the
author of such a misfortune, particularly
when she recollected the duplicity he
had practised m order to accomplish his
purpose; and thus indignant at Ins con­

before Viola’s explanation, were turned
to a dreadful certainty,—the fatal truth
was divulged,—his son, once his pride
and happiness, was now a curse to him1
—the destroyer of his illustrious house,
—and, inthebitterness of his indignation
and sorrow, a malediction against him
had almost escaped his lips.
He immediately repaired to communi­
cate this intelligence to the King; as to
conceal it would, he knew, implicate
himself; it was received as he had ex­
pected ;—his Majesty^s rage was almost
unbounded, he uttered the severest in­
vectives and reproaches against the Mar-
cheze, whom he viewed with every feel­
ing of resentment that Montalban’s con­
duct could inspire, and denounced dis­
grace and exilement to his whole family,
if within six months the Princess was
not found.
The unfortunate Vittoria had foreseen
all tins, but he heard without a murmur
the harsh sentence, conscious that no ac-
THE ASTROLOGER 137
lion of his own deserved it, and unable to
offer any extenuation in behalfof his son.
In a short time the circumstance be­
came generally known throughout the
court and city. Detachments of the mi­
litary were forthwith despatched in va­
rious directions, in search of the fugi­
tives ; all public business was suspended,
—and this affair alone occupied the mind
of every body.
Meanwhile, owing to the cleverness
of their guide, and his knowledge of the
several roads, Montalban and the Prin­
cess were safe from their pursuers,
every individual of whom was stimu­
lated by a promise the King had given,
to grant whatever request the first who
brought intelligence ofthe Infanta, should
make of him. The pursuit was conti­
nued for several weeks; nothing was left
undone by which, it seemed likely they
should hear any thing of her. But all
proved ineffectual; and consternation,
138 THE ASTROLOGER.
regret, and disappointment, succeeded
to their hopes.
The Marcheze had received a similar
promise,from his Majesty, of the grant oi
any favour he should demand on the
same condition; but, he wanted not that
to induce him, to make every possible ef
fort ty.discGver their retreat; he was ac­
tuated by different motives. However
abhorrent such an idea would have been
to him at;^ny other time, there were now
circumstances that led him to
that Sebastian was the murderer
ofi Frmee Orlando. It was repugnant
to bh feelings to;mention the horrible
suggestion to Viola, though, his suspi­
cions had chiefly originated m what she
had related ; and he concluded that she
already harboured some idea of it.
From feelings of gratitude to his so­
vereign, from whom he had received
such high and distinguished favours* he
would have made every exertion in his
THE ASTROLOGER. 139
power to find the Princess, and restore
her to her disconsolate family.
Ambition was one of the. failings of
the Marcheze, andhe had, by policy and
cleverness, raised himself to a pinnacle
of greatness, from which, he now saw,
one rude blast would inevitably hurl
him. Regard for the safety and honour
of his noble house was a powerful incen­
tive ; but, independent of all these, he
was influenced by principles of justice,
with which lie vowed that no sentiments
of filial tenderness should interfere,
should.Sebastian’s guilt be proved * even
the lasting* unhappiness and shame that
would accrue to himself was a minor
consideration; and should it be neces­
sary, lie determined to sacrifice his
dearest interests,— his ambition and
pride, to the rigorous claims ofjustice.
From so many calamitous events, the
Spanish court had long been a continued
scene of confusion and dismay. Peace
and happiness seemed to have fled for
THE ASTHOLOGEIi.
ever, and sorrow had converted it to its
gloomy abode. Amusements of every
description were put a stop to; even the
union of Don Manuel dfOreIIez and Viola
was suspended, every other wish giving
way to that of again beholding their
amiable Princess.
However exasperated at Montalban’s
conduct the King had been, no suspi­
cions like what the Marcheze enter­
tained had yet entered his bosom, though
there were now many who could not
help thinking with the latter, that none
but a lover would have dared to remove
an obstacle so powerful as Orlando; and
that lover was the esteemed and unfor­
tunate Conde Montalban, for amidst the
ignominy and disgrace thus heaped upon
him, still his amiable and endearing qua­
lities could not be forgotten.
From the first intimation of his pas­
sion for the infanta, he was, however,
the only object of the Queen’s suspi­
cions, though for many reasons she
THE ASTROLOGER. 141
dreaded to reveal them. Under any
other cErcumstances her indignation at
Montalban’s having aspired to the pos­
session of Elvira would have burst forth;
but determined to render her knowledge
of it subservient to her own purposes,
and fearing to hazard an accusation of so
tremendous a nature as that of murder,
as it might prove without foundation,
and perhaps be eventually the means of
exposing many things of herself that she
wished concealed, she was silent on the
subject,—but the most anxious wish of
her heart was, that other people might
be induced to betray their suspicions,
aware that she was deeply in the power
of Montalban, and trusting, that if they
proved well founded, justice would at
length rid her of one whom she so much
feared; and a circumstance occurred
shortly afterwards, from which, with
secret joy, she anticipated the realiza­
tion of her hopes.
The Prince Regent of Portugal still
142 THE ASTROLOGER.
remained at Madrid, a prey to melan­
choly for the deaih of his darling ne­
phew, whose murderer not all the most
indefatigable exertions of government
had yet been able 'to discover;—grief,
too, for the absence of Elvira, indigna­
tion against Montalban, and rage at the
destruction of his ambitious projects, in­
creased his mental sufferings. It had
been his determination 'tojmake propo­
sals of marriage for Elvira, as a wife not
only calculated'to *make lhim happy in
every respect, but "hlso one, through
whose alliarice^o the‘Spanish throne, he
could, he hoped, carry-into execution his
secret schemes of aggrandizement.
His hopes thus overthrown, and his
views defeated, he continually execrated
the Gonde as the c^use of all. It was
no longer his intention to sue for the
hand of the Infanta, even should she re­
turn, though her marriage 'with Montal-
ban was no obstacle to it, as a dispensa­
tion could easily be obtained from the
THE ASTROLOGER.' 143
Pope; but after the proof she had
given of lier predilection for another, it
was not to be supposed that she would
ever willingly consent to become his.
And such was the partiality of the King
her father towards her, that lie knew no
consideration, independent of the good
of his kingdom, would induce him to
constrain her inclinations, nay, that he
would infinitely prefer' seeing her the
happy wife of the CohdeMontdlban, than
behold her on the throne'of Portugal, in
the midst of splendid misery.
Under these circumstances, it did not
appear probable that his suit would be
successful, and to depart so far from his
high dignity as to hazard a refusal, was
not to be thought of.
Revenge took possession of his whole
soul at the recollection that his purpose
had been thus twice baffled; and he
burned with impatience for the return of
the Eve of San Sebastian, having dreamt,
that if he went to the chapel, beneath
144 THE A&TllQLOGEH.
which Orlando's corpse was deposited,
on that night, at his accustomed hour,
the ghost of the murdered Prince would
reveal the assassin's name, in order that
he might be brought to justice.
Credulity was one of Alonzo’s known
weaknesses, and this dream made so
strong an impression on his mind, that
he resolved to obey the injunction impli­
citly, and accordingly he put his de­
termination m practice, when the long
wished-for night arrived.

E a r l y oh the Eve of San Sebastian,
the Prince secretly prepared for his aw­
ful visit to the chapel. It was a large
edifice, of very ancient date, but had
been enriched by many modern im­
provements, and was almost surrounded
by a spacious planted enclosure, at one
corner of which was a private door mto
the mausoleum, under which ran an ex­
tensive range of vaults, long said to
be haunted by the shades of departed
royalty.
VOL, III, h
140 THE ASTROLOGER*
Until near midnight the Prince had
delayed to go•, and, as it approached, hib
courage began to fail him: but at length
he endeavoured to subdue his fears, and
cautiously proceeded, in the most inde­
scribable state of mind.
The night was awfully dark, and the
wind, m tremendous and long-continued
blasts, howled loudly along the echoing
colonnade that fronted the chapel, whose
black shadow was rendered yet more
terrific by the partial rays from the lamp
he carried in his unsteady hand, as
trembling he advanced more slowly, and
cast his eyes over the stupe.ndous build
ing, within whose lonely walls he was
about to trust himself at this awful houi
of darkness*
Believing that so important a dis­
covery now depended on his persevei-
anee, he resolved to brave every thing
to accomplish it* Hastily unlocking the
chapel-door, he flung it open, and an
THE ASTROLOGER* 147
unpropitious blast, occasioned by the
suddenness of the motion, at the same
instant extinguished his lamp.
Thus enveloped in-total darkness, he
again hesitated whether he should go on
or turn back; but ashamed of his weak­
ness, he summoned alLhis resolution and
entered.
The aisles in frightful sounds reverbe­
rated his footsteps, which, imnglmg.with
the hollow breeze that swept through
the lofty arches, he again began to
waver, and was obliged to lean against
one of the massy pillars for support.
The great clock .now slowly tolled a
quarter past twelve, and immediately
after was heard the dismal watch-word
of the sentinels on guard about the Pa­
lazzo, who were about to be relieved by
others, who, as they advanced within a
short distance of the chapel, with then*
torches, opposite a large Gothic win­
dow, somewhat lower than the rest, dis­
covered to Alonzo, by the momentary
h 2

flash that fell beside him, and glarea
horribly on a large streak of blood, with
which the base of one of the pillars wa^
stained, that he now stood on the verj
spot where the Lady Viola di Montal-
ban had so nearly fallen beneath thi
poniard of her brother His previous
terrors had not prepared him sufficient!}
for this shock, to prevent him from
uttering an exclamation ofhorror, which
vibrating through the immense avenues
that branched off the body of the chapeh
his resolution was once more nearly
overcome.
“ How .preposterous is all this,” said
he, as he bent his steps fearfully towards
the door.— “ Fool that I have been, to
yield to the ridiculous fantasies of thr
brain, or imagine that thecommon course
of nature would be disturbed merely foi
my gratification, or to elucidate a mys
tery Heaven hath so long kept to itself1

mv presumption.”
THE ASTROLOGER. 149
“ At thy peril stir not hence T inter­
rupted a voice, m death-like tones, which
seemed to proceed from the tombs be­
neath ; and as it fell in dreadful cadence
on the slow blast, spread through the
whole building in a sound so appalling,
that he stood transfixed with terror to
the spot, whilst his eyes were bent in
the direction whence the voice had
issued, not doubting that he had been
accosted by an inhabitant of another
world.
The noise of a fall of ram beating
heavily against the windows, recalled his
fleeting senses, and presently he heard
his name repeated in the same sepul­
chral tone.
“ Fear nought, Alonzo,” it continued,
“ thy prayer for retribution hath been
heard; and I, the spirit of thy murdered
kinsman, am now permitted to reveal
the assassin. I am the vision whom
thou sawest in thy dream, appointed to
execute the will of Heaven, m return for

memorable spot, a sum such as thou
shalt hear. To-morrow, at this solemn
hour of midnight, be here where now
thou standest, nor dare to approach
further, as thou dost value thine exist*

wards, if thou wouldst avoid death cer­
tain and dreadful*—nor breathe a syl­
lable of this to mortal ;—farewell.**
** Divine oracle, thou shalt be obeyed,”
exclaimed he, throwing himself on his
khees, whilst a cold perspiration moist­
ened his forehead, and he shuddered as
the appalling sound still dwelt on the
air.
Almost unconsciously he quitted the
chapel, and regained his apartments un-
THE ASTROLOGEB. 151
observed. Through the night he was
restless andifeverish, and,he arose next
t V
morning languid and unwell, from want
of repose, having merely had, short in­
tervals ofuneasy slumbers, during which
the shade of Orlando seemed to hover
over him, urging him to vengeance,
while the same dreadful voice addressed
him, in hollowand sepulchral tones, that
chilled his very soul.
One of Alonzo’s principal favourites at
court was Don Yincentio, a young noble­
man of the most amiable disposition,
and attractive manners, who had so far
won his friendship and esteem, that the
Prince considered, that to withhold his
confidence from him, even in this affair,
wherem he had received such a strict in­
junction to secrecy, would be a breach of
that friendship which had so long existed
between them. After some delibera­
tion, he resolved to send for him, and
communicate the occurrence of the pre-
h 4
1 5 2 THE ASTROLOGER»
ceding night, trusting that no ill could
accrue from his reposing the secret m
the bosom of one so confidential, and
who would never betray it to another.
Don.Vincentio at first seemed disin­
clined to credit the assertion of a cir­
cumstance so awful and extraordinary,
until, venturing to express his doubts,
the Prince regarded him with a look of
stern displeasure.
“ Speak not thus;rashly, Señor,” said
he, “ or tremble for what the conse­
quences may be. Canst thou, pool
mortal, dare indeed to dispute the Su­
preme Power, or think such things can­
not be, because to thy weak understand­
ing they appear improbable, or do not
occur amongst the common events oí
life; nay, you shall this night accom­
pany me to the chapel, there to see and
hear such things as an atheist dare not
deny. But, mark mé; you must be silent
as the grave, if you would preserve us
THE ASTROLOGER. 153
both from destruction. Meet me in the
western court, a few minutes before
midnight; till then farewell.”
Astonished beyond measure at this
mysterious affair, but yet incredulous, m
spite ofthe arguments of thePrince, Vin-
centio, who possessed invincible courage
and presence of mind, resolved at all
events, to go with him to the chapel to
see the result.
Accordingly, when the appointed time
arrived, they repaired thither together,
with a lamp, and the money and jewels
Alonzo was again horror-struck on
entering; and though he had at first re­
gretted his having confided the affair to
the sceptical Vincentio, his fears were
now considerably lessened, by having
him for a companion. They advanced ,
to the altar with reverential awe, in­
spired rather by the solemnity of the
place, than any apprehension of danger;
and laying down the offering, the Prince
perceived at his feet a small musket,
h 5
154 THE“ASTROLOGER.
with a piece*of paper attached to it, on
which were written in an almost illegible
hand, these words, “ the silver»plate'on
theendwillrevea!all; take it, anddepart.”
Alonzo eagerly-snatched it up, and,
fearing*to view it in this awful spot, put
it in his pocket, and made a motion to
retire; when, to his astonishmentand dis­
may, Vincentio requested permission to
descend into the vaults.
The Prince started at the proposal, as
those dismal mansions of the dead were
fully believed to be the4
haunts of souls
long departed from this world, and he
fancied he heard their sighs' in every
breath ofwind. He remonstrated with
him on the imprudence of doing so, and
the penis to which he would thus expose
himself, by vainly attempting to pry,into
those' solemn secrets, <from the. know­
ledge of which they were interdicted.

shaken by fears that appeared so absurd
and pusillanimous; which Alonzo per­

the event, and reluctantly sanctioned his
descent into the vaults.

grating, he was out pf. sight in a few mi­

for several moments through the long
arcade of vaults.
1With unusual'firmness ofmind, Alonzo
rushed fromJthe chapel, and summoned
assistance, which, notwithstanding the
lateness of the hour, and the intense
darkness, he immediately procured from
the Palazzo.
Accompanied by several1of the mili­
tary, and others well armed, however
impious it would have been deemed "at
any other time' to bear hostile weapons
within those sacred walls, he proceeded
mto the vaults, when the first object
that presented itself, through the dusky
cloud of smoke, was thfe corpse of the
'ill-fated Don Vincentio, weltering in
blood.
Few can conceive, much less describe
the scene that ensued. The inconso­
lable and enraged friends of Vincentio
' demanded sternly the purport ' of this
nocturnal visit to such a place ; and
THE ASTROLOGER. 157
under circumstances so suspicious, they
would have openly accused Alonzo of
the murder, and seized him, notwith­
standing his high rank and dignity, had
he not unreservedly explained his dream,
appealing to his confidential servant, to
whom he had imparted it, for the truth
ofhis assertion; to prove which, he drew
forth the musket, and, looking on the end
of it, beheld, engraved in small letters,
the Gonde Montalban’s name!
• The horror with which this discovery
filled every one present, was hardly sur­
passed by the frightful appearance of
the corpse, the face of which seemed
scarcely human, so shockingly was it
mangled ; one side of the head presented
a wound large and hideous; the eyes
had been driven from their sockets, the
jaws almost completely broken, and the
so lately handsome Vincentio, but a few
short minutes before blooming amid all
the graces and fascinating qualifications

that can adorn manhood, could.now be
recognised only,by his dress. r
Exclamations were every where heard
from-his disconsolate relatives, denounc­
ing vengeance and, imprecations on all
.concerned m this horrible catastrophe.
Every part of the vaults accessible to a
human being was explored m vain; the
assassin had by .some means effected
his escape, ifindeed Vincentio had fallen
by the arm of mortal ; to .many, it ap­
peared improbable that a living-being
would be daring enough to enter a place
whose very name brought terror with it,
for.so diabolical a purpose, and alone,—
at an hour too when the most coura­
geous individual, in Spain would have
shuddered at the idea of being,left by
.himself there, so widely had supersti­
tion.propagated .the horrors of it.
It was.soon,-however, almost the ge­
neral, opinion, that .Don Vincentio^ had
met hisideath from super-human power.
THE ASTROLOGER. 159
This .idea was strengthened by the
strongly-presumptive proofs they, had,
in.having thus miraculously discovered
the murderer of Orlando ; and,(with re­
gard, to the latter circumstance, .there
were few now who entertained a.doubt.
With this conviction, they bore the
bleeding body from the vault, amidst
theheart-rending groans and tears-of his
friends, and the.most terrible denuncia­
tions of vengeance on Montalban, who
was now the* principal object of their
fury and resentment, ¡¡which was, not
even superseded by their, horror at this
new catastrophe.
Even for the safety of -Alonzo -there
were serious :apprehensions entertained
at first, from the exasperated crowd ;
but fortunately for him, the ¡gold and
jewels still lay at the foot-
,of the;altar
untouched, as if, by corroborating¡the
truth of what he had stated.in his de­
fence, the same mysterious power that
had willed this event had,.also intended

to preserve'him thus singularly from the
almost certain death that it appeared
probable he would otherwise have been
consigned to.
The news of the murder, and all the
circumstances attending it, spread ra­
pidly; and, inless than half an hour, the
whole Palazzo presented a scene of con­
sternation and uproar. The extraordi­
nary and long-sought discovery that had
been made, and the horrible and mys­
terious assassination of Don Vincenpo,
were the awful themes that employed
every tongue. The unfortunate Mon-
talban was now, indeed, stigmatized as
a murderer—a disgrace to his family, to
his country, and to human nature. The
enormity c-f the crime, too, seemed ag­
gravated by the high rank of his victim.
What intelligence for theears ofa father!
This dreadful confirmation of all that he
had until now only suspected, gave a
shock to his feelings that words are
inadequate to describe.
THE ASTROLOGER. 161
While Sebastian appeared deserving
of* it, he had ever loved him with
paternal tenderness ; but now he re­
garded him as an object of abhor­
rence and detestation;—as a wretch,
whom every law, human and divine, ren­
dered it incumbent on him to seek, and
deliver up tojustice; and, to accomplish
this, as well as to restore the Princess,
he determined to leave no means un­
tried—indignation and horror supersed­
ing every other sentiment in his bosom.
That determination gained strength,
as he daily witnessed the languishing
state of the King’s health, who, incon­
solable for the loss of his' beloved
daughter, and incensed at the affront
thathadbeen offered to his royal house,
had sunk into a consuming melancholy,
from which the Infanta’s return seemed
the only thing likely to recover him.
The resentmentofthepeopl&was again
almost simultaneously roused against
Montalban by the late discovery; for,

although, some expressions had dropped
from Viola, during- her conversation
with her father, which, gave him to,
understand, that, on the night;she had
so nearly,fallen a sacrifice, in the chapel
beneath the dagger, of her brother, he
had been actuated,to the,almost fatal
L f i N J l
crime by his jealous fears, that .Alonzo
had gained the affections ofjElvira—by
his«detestation of a,supposed successful
rival-rand forthwith had reached the
public ear,—although, for, this, oppro­
brium and censure,had been heaped
on him, while, still they had made allow­
ances for the baneful influence of-jea­
lousy under, which he had laboured,—
r
uptil now, the foul,enormity of actual,
murder-had not.been registered, intthe
catalogue of his misfortunes,and guilt.
Even Alonzo, with-all his prejudices,
had not dared to conceive a suspicion
so horrible. Nay, -by many, all was
until now almost forgotten, inrtheir zeal
and anxiety for the restoration-of their
THE ASTROLOGER. 163
Sovereign’s health, and the return of
their adored Princess. The, amiable
qualities of Montalban had, however, en­
deared,him to many of the friends of his
early youth; and, even in the contem­
plation of his guilt, still did they,pity
him—while they condemned him, still
was their friendship not withdrawn.
Montalban now stood,forthas a being
who must shortly be brought before
the awful tribunal of justice, charged
with crimes of the mpst heinous nature,
forrwhich .his life would surely- be the
forfeit. To entertain a hope that the
royal clemency.would be extended to
him seemed absurd. Time, instead of
meliorating the health and spirits of the
King, daily made him more depressed.
He was not less exasperated than at
first against Montalban, that presump­
tuous; traitor, who, had*at once insulted
his regal dignity, and rpbbed him of his
daughter and ,his happiness.» Nay, so

ment, when six months had nearly ex­
pired, without bringing the most trifling
intelligence of Elvira, that every suc­
ceeding day seemed to threaten the
downfal of the noble House of Vittoria.
Even had there existed a hope of his
Majesty?s pardon, it would have availed
little/ when opposed to the denuncia­
tions of Alonzo and his determinate
vows, that justice should takeits course,
and no earthly power interfere to rob it
of its Tight. The Prince was intent on
revenge for the murder of his kinsman,
and, should Montalban be found, and
proved guilty, his inevitable death would
be the eousequenee
But this important affair yet required
much further investigation; foramongst
Montalban’s friends werea sceptical few
who discredited, nay suspected some
mischievous policy lurked beneath, the
late mysterious occurrence; for to them
the intervention-of super-human power
seemed highly improbable—insomuch

that they did not scruple openly to
declare their doubts, regardless of the
disapprobation their incredulity gene­
rally elicited. The musket, on which
was engraved hisname, hadbeenbrought
forward against the Conde, and to se­
veral it appeared an incontestable evi­
dence of his guilt. But was the life of
a fellow-creature (in reality perhaps in­
nocent of it) to be staked,on a transac­
tion so obscure and unaccountable?
Was it .likely that, had Heaven em­
ployed its missionaries to reveal the per­
petrator of so vile a deed, it would,
through the same agency, have wrought
a catastrophe so horrible as the murdei
of Don Vmcentio? Certainly not. It
appeared an offence against Heaven to
believe such a thing probable ; and to
this opinion the friends of Vmcentio
soon became converts; and in their zeal

The contemplation1of such accumu­

tranquil and composed.
From this changeit was generally con­

had been schooled in all the vices of a
court, where he had progressively insi­
nuated himself, by a happy knack he
possessed of courting the attentions and
flattering the foibles of the great and
powerful.
With the few virtues to be found
there he was totally unacquainted. The
natural depravity of his heart was con­
cealed beneath an exterior handsome and
prepossessing. His countenance was of
a peculiar cast, and sometimes'betrayed

The lattenwas, however, too .much on
his ,guard, against giving any, offence,
and too securely screened from the ef­

aware several people bore him,and from
which he *knew few courtiers, enjoy­

character of Malvoho was that hideous

possible, even hardened as he was, that
he could be happy.
On the demise of his father, a rich
patrimony had devolved to him, besides
considerable sums of money, which
proved; however, a fatal bequest, as it
enabled him to indulge still further his
passion for play, and to run into excesses
and debaucheries which otherwise he
must have avoided
This career ofprofligacy was for many
years unchecked, until the exhausted
state of his finances, the impoverished
aspect of all* his domestic affairs, and
mortgage of his paternal estate, m con­
sequence "ofthe enormous debts he had
contracted, at length presented to his
view a picture from which he recoiled
with horror.*

dreaded;the exposure of his character,
and the ignominy that would be heaped

past, or a pang at the contemplation

at one bold stroke, he could retrieverhis
shattered fortunes, and again pursue his

Mischief is ever ready to assist its
votaries; and from this dilemma'he was
for awhile relieved by a.circumstance,
that augured too favourably at ’first not
to be taken advantage of—

he-heard with terror Vincentio’s deter­
mination'to enter the vaults,1in order to
investigate the affair; and; in the first
mbments of his Agitation, he was almost
induced to fly; as the only means of
ensuring his safety. But the idea *ot
abandoning so rich a prize, now so
nearly in his possession, seemed;absurd
and culpable; to obtainit he thoughtfno
risk too great/ He, therefore, resolved:
to -run' every hazard; andhad* scarcely
been prepared to defend himself with
his formidable weapon against an in­
truder; when the unfortunate' Vincentio
appeared, descending from the chapel,
who, ere he had advanced three steps
lower, met the direful fate that awaited
him. ' • *
Malvolio!now beheld with horror and
$ /
affright the deed he had done, and1shud­
dered'as the consequences of it rushed
upon his mind." Life had instantly fled
from'the body of Vinceniio ;' and the
blood flowed so copiously *from /the
i 6
180 THE ASTROLOGER*
wounds,.as in a few moments;to render'
it so awful a spectacle, that even he,
hardened as he was, could not contem­
plate it withoutbeing appalled, and feel­
ing his conscience oppressed by the
enormity ofthe crime.
Though he had before determined to
encounter every danger, rather than re­
linquish so rich a prize; yet now that he
looked on the bleeding corse of Vin-
centio, the sight of death in so terrific a
shape had power to change his resolu­
tion—to check even his avarice. To fly
would be to lose all; all, for which he
had sacrificed so much—for which he
had bartered his happiness and peace
for ever. But this moment was a critical
one; to remain would be to wait for
certain death, as he knew the report of
the musket would, of course, draw a
crowd into the vaults, and then his fate
would be inevitable. ’Twould surely, he
thought, be the action of a madman to
rush deliberately on destruction; and
THE ASTROLOGER? 181
the dreadful conviction that, instead of
being prepared for death, he was now
plunged into the deepestuabyss of vil-
lany and guilt, roused himmore strongly
to a sense of the ¡dangers1of delaying;
and at the same moment hearing adoud
noise ofiseveral voices in the court,, evi­
dently of persons approaching, he at
once made a precipitate escape. < 1' *, •,,
Arrived at his apartments, he shrunk
from the scrutinizing glancesiof Uberto
in confusion. He trembled violently;
and desired to be left alone. The offi-
ciousvalet, however, contrived to remain,
in order to discover, if possible, what
fresh crimes he was involved in; and,
being not over scrupulous in obeying
his master’s orders,-from a justifiable
opinion, that, since they had become
mutual accomplices in many an act unfit
to meet the light, that vast distinction
no longer existed between them, which,
from the rank?!of Don Malvolio, lie had
formerly acknowledged. . '
Ï82 THE ASTROLOGER."
His. excessive agitationandincoherent
expressions soon betrayed to Uberto.the
iniquitous undertaking he had been con­
cerned in.
From the time the latter had first en­
tered the service oft Malvolio, his prin­
ciples had been perverted. He had
long been accustomed to the. commis­
sion of crimes, and few;were they that
he could not view without remorse.
Even in this affair he had, in some^de­
gree, assisted his master, without being
aware to what his •»
preparations tended.
But now, on*hearing of this most hor­
rible transaction,, a climax; of enormity
to which he thought no human being,
however abandoned, would ever pro­
ceed, he involuntarily started from him
in1terror and abhorrence Those sensa­
tions,’however, soon wore off, as Mab
volio hinted that the prize he. had lost
might- yet be recovered. The latter
saw that he had unguardedlycommitted
his secret to a wretch who would, not

a probability of any advantagetaccrumg
to himself "from: doing so; and'that it
was necessary to purchase his silence

Prince,.Alonzo's gold could alone enable
himtodo—gamingand dissipation having
reduced his once splendid fortune to the
lowest pitch; and how it was to be
obtained now became a subject of deli­
beration. .
At the1 mention*of this, the case api
peared to Uberto in a more favourable
light. The' deed seemed much less
atrocious, when he considered that it
would propablyturn out so profitably to
him. He even- persuaded his master
into assort of selbapprobation, at the
certainty there appeared of his thus
enriching himself; and the secure and,

could entertain no doubt of the steps
that, would be taken against Montalban.
By degrees, thistopie became divested
of its horrors; they were familiarized to
scenes of depravity and bloodshed, and
Vincentio’s death was soon thought of
with as much apathy and indifference as
one of the most common occurrences.of
life, . .
With all the freedom he considered

proaches ; but he also knew that he was

would otherwise have done, and that his

therefore saw more reason to congra­

gret it.

quences, which, alas, no atonement could
.now repair; he felt his humiliation, and
the censure to which lie had exposed
himself, by having suffered his reason to
be so led away by the bigotted ideas he
had early imbibed. Bui princes have
their failings, their weaknesses, then
faults, and.defects, as,well as other men.
From no mortal does indulgent Heaven
expect perfection; error is not peculiar
to a few unenlightened beings, it is com­

turing reflections and fears, could fur­

of the dice were fluctuating and uncer­
tain.
^Fortune sometimes favoured dissipa­
tion^ votaries,1
—adventitious luck had
fallen to many, but to him it had been
almost constantly adverse. ManyJdes­
perate throws had he made, nay, he had
squandered an immense income arising
from an extensive estate, which he' had
at-length'been compelled to mortgage;
from those who deemed h i s honour a
sufficient pledge forthe payment, he had
borrowed considerable sums,—all had

preserving even his life, he resolved to
venture again. Should fortune once
smile upon-him, he'trusted she would
continue to befriend'him, havingoften
observed that herreverses were sudden
and,unexpected, but generally of long

while ,rage and ¡envy inflamed the coun­

192 THE ASTROLOGER.
That joy, however, produced by his
continued success, was soon damped
by innumerable claims on all sides from
those with whom he had contracted
debts, which ,they now considered him
able to pay. The demands were as in­
cessant ,as they were numerous, and,
persecuted by the importunities of the
host of duns that surrounded him, and
the bitteritaunts of those by whose losses
he was thus rapidly profiting, the iras­
cibility of his temper soon got the better
of hisjudgment at play; in almost every
game whose success depended on skill,
he lost with the . dice he frequently
won, but on sthe whole, he saw <his
finances again on,the decline.
Some months passed in this manner,
during which he experienced much of
the variableness of, fortune, meeting ¿its

necessitated to.make would fail.
Meanwhile he had neglected to fulfil,
almost indeed forgotten, his agreement
with Uberto. Time, and a ' constant
round of gaming and dissipation; had
weakened his fears with regard to the
dreadful secret with which he had un­
warily intrusted him. Nor did he re­
flect ■‘that his safety depended " much
more on the fulfilment of it than on any
natural fidelity of disposition m his ser­
vant. Few things were able to with­
draw his attention from those scenes 'of
dissipation m which he was almost con­
tinually engaged,— even to the danger
of his, situation, or the probability of
Uberto’s betraying him, he was hardly
sensible,,,
The’whole*kingdonrwas at present in

throughout the court all was agitation

different passions. The prospect of the
prime minister’s disgrace was to the
enemies of Vittona the richest banquet
they could enjoy. Ambition was on the
wing, and treachery and deceit did not
scruple to come forward, if possible, to'
endeavour at once to supplant him by
their specious arts The friends of the'
Marcheze were no less indignant at the
idea of his fall, nor less grieved at the
apparent impossibility of preventing it,
well knowing how arbitrary was the
temper of their sovereign.
Besides the commotion caused by this
important affair, the feelings of the
people were powerfully called forth, arid
alarm, excited by the dreadful occur­
rences that had marked the ‘ course of
the last twelve months, and the mys­
terious manner m which they had hap­
pened,—

by which they could effect a discovery

fatuated was Malvolio by the alluring
baits that vice held out to him,-—so in-
thralled was he in its dangerous plea­
sures,— so beguiled from prudence and
reflection, that a fatal blow was about to
fall on him, even at the moment when he
fancied himself in perfect security.
From a person of Uberto’s habits and
disposition, little fidelity was to be ex­
pected towards even a master the most
liberal, the most amiable,—much less
towards such a one as Bon Màlvolio;

appeared as if the vital spark was ex­
tinct, but a deep groan at length pro­
claimed reviving animation. Having
gone*through all the necessary forms of
trial, his unfeeling judges bade him en­
tertain no hopes of mercy from them;
and, after advising him to make his
peace with offended Heaven, and prepare
for an after-state of happiness, which
repentance and atonement could alone
render him deserving of, while in his
power, to spend the few short hours lie
had to live m prayer, the final sentence
was passed—a sentence, however, which
he owned was not more dreadful than
just:; and, in consideration of his high
birth he was to be beheaded on the fol­
lowing evening, instead of undergoing
the usual ceremony of ther auto da fe,
burning at the:stake.
He mowisunk: fainting inithe arms of
one of the familiars,, and was' re-dom

A dreary and death-like silence pre­
vailed around—unbroken by the sound
of a human voice—a pitying word or
look would have been grateful to his
heart—but his conductors spoke not—
and, in a few moments the door of his
prison was closed with a tremendous
sound—it struck anicy chillinessthrough
his whole franco, and he dropped on the
ground almost m a state of torpor* from
which be was shortly roused by the
entrance o f. Father Rosario, the con­
fessor. “ This is an awful night to thee,
my son/’ observed the monk in a kind
and gentle tone, “ but God grant that

and sorrow,’’ . i

with a;look that spoke all the virtues of
his heart; and the zea^with which he
performed' his holy functions, while
Malvolio wondered that such a. man
should-be an inhabitant of-the Inqui­
sition. Rosario took one of the hands
of the kneeling culprit in his:— “ -Let
me thus save from ruin, a valuable

its almost inseparable companion, fol­
lows its footsteps, ready to prey upon
every thing that it has discovered.
Notwithstanding the precautions*

took to avoid any appearance ofmystery
or secrecy, their actions wore an air

impossible to divest themselves of, and

which did not escape the notice of
many; nor failed to give rise to various
conjectures.
An opinion was soon prevalent/that
they were not in reality what they'ap­
peared, but personages of much higher
rank in disguise; and for assuming-that
disguise there were evidentlystrong rea­
sons. No sooner was heard the ex­
traordinary intelligence, that a Princess
of Spain had eloped with a young-no­
bleman of her' father’s ’ court, nobody
knew whither,, than suspicion fell on
them, and they »became objects of uni­
versal observation,' from the .circum­
stances connected with their relative
situations; thus discovered,;and¡aware
that it would be absurd and unavailing
to attempt further concealment, the de­
ception was thrown off, they beheld
themselves exposed to every thing that
could make them .unhappy, and render
their,,situation *irksome -and insupport­
able; - any alternative , by which they
206 THE -ASTROLOGEtU
could rush from those miseries seemed
preferable, and then it was that they
first formed the resolution of returning
to Spain; of two evils, however, they
had. chosen the most formidable, like
many who prefer a remedy often worse
than the disease; but so many things
seemed to conspire against them, that
they determined to remain no longer in
a place where they suffered continual
persecution.
That Sebastian could enjoy any real
happiness was impossible,-hie conscience
burthened by a crime of such magni­
tude as the murder of Orlando; he
fancied, too, that his concealment of it
hitherto was a crime; but many were
the storms he had encountered, nume­
rous the sacrifices he had made to ob­
tain his adored Elvira, and no sacrifice
short of his soul’s happiness and safety
would lie have stopped at. -
All the consolation, however was his
that could be derived from the hope
THE ASTROLOGEIt. 207
that sincere repentance and/prayer had
made his peace with Heaven, and all
the pleasure any earthly /object coin’d
afford him lie found in the possession, of
Elvira*
He was now universally regarded
with horror by every tiody else—stig­
matized as a murderer-shunned by the
few whose worthless friendship had
been before proffered to him-—treated
with contempt even by his inferiors,
and talked of every where*as the aban­
doned being who had dared, by acts of
treason and bloodshed, to interrupt the
peace of a whole nation, the parricide
who had drawn dishonour and destruc­
tion on his family.
Of nothing that had passed all this
time at the Spanish court was he ig­
norant; his mind was in a great measure
prepared for'the dreadful sentence he
was aware /his crimes deserved; he
shuddered at a fate so horrible as that
which threatened him* and which it now
208 THE ASTROLOGER.
seemed impossible to avoid, as he should
doubtless, he thought, be pursued to
even the remotest-retreat he could ,fly
to; but it did not give such a shock to
his feelings as that of exilement and
disgrace denounced against the Mar-
cheze his father, for he, alas! was;the
guilty cause of it.' ’ . .
But it was not yet too late to. try to
avert the blow. To save his father,
surely no sacrifice consistent with ho­
nour and integrity could be too great,
it might perhaps be some atonement.for
his past conduct: for, oh! how greatly
would it add to the enormity of his sins,
to be the cause of a parents ruin.
The only reparation in his power now
to make, was to preserve him, by re­
storing' Elvira, relinquishing every claim
(to her, and delivering himself at, once
into the hands of justice. This would
indeed be ^sacrificing largely, but ago­
nizing as it* might be, he secretly,.de-
termined on it. Yet how could he bear
THE ASTROLOGER. 209
to make such a proposal to Elvira—she,
who loved him so fondly, so disinterest­
edly, notwithstanding all his failings,
all his crimes, would assuredly never
consent to his voluntarily consigning
himself to certain death; for, though she
had" readily ' agreed with'him, that it
would be better to return to Madrid,
and sue for the royal pardon; yet-the
idea that he meant to resign her, and
forget that she had ever been his wife,
had never entered her 'mmd; she en­
tertained the most sanguine hopes of
being able to move" the King to for­
giveness; and had she thought for a
moment, that death would be Montal-
p
ban’s portion, not even to prevent, the
downfall ofthe Marcheze would she have
allowed him to venture back to Spain*J
As it was, however, their1 departure
was fixed upon, after various delays on
her~ part, unwilling as she was that Se­
bastian-should hasten to meet the frowns

of a monarch, so much and so justly in-
210 THE ASTROLOGER.
censed,*—and, but for this alone, she
would have accelerated the preparations
for their journey, no local object what­
ever having attached her to their present
residence.
The necessary arrangements were at
length completed— and a day for their
setting out appointed: as it approached
Montalban became more and more de­
jected, his spirits suddenly entirely for­
sook him; for the few last days of his
stay* he resolved,to seek the most dismal
solitude, where he might, undisturbed,
ruminate on all his sorrows, and even
,i
the presence of his beloved Elvira was
now irksome; it was now, indeed, that
he felt the magnitude of those sorrows,—
the extent of his miseries—the wretch­
edness,,the horrors of his situation,—the
strongest mind would have wavered be­
fore such a prospect as he .beheld; it
was unenlivened by a single hope,— all,
all within his bosom was despair,—the
conflict between filial duty, and the ties
THE ASTROLOGER. 211
that bound him to Elvira was almost too
painful to be borne, each seemed equally
to demand the sacrifice of the other,—to
acquit himselfofboth as his heart wished
was impossible,— and therefore in yield­
ing to the claims of one, the'other must
be relinquished and forgotten'; in pre­
serving his father from the ruin that
threatened him, he must give up Elvira
for ever,—and he saw the unconditional,
the imperious necessity of doing either;
the idea of death was less appalling than
the latter, and that this too would be his
fate, appeared almost certain, aware that
ic was what every law*ofnature awarded
to a crime like his.
He suffered not the too-confident
hopes of the Princess to deceive him into
a belief that a ready forgiveness awaited
themboth on their return to, Spain, not­
withstanding the unfavourable circum­
stances report had circulated.. He well
knew the determined- disposition of the
King ; this friendship -when conciliated,
212 THE ASTROLOGER.
was steady,—his enmity when provoked,
almost implacable, and difficult was the
task to appease it. Besides even*should
he relent, and be inclined to yield their
pardon to the tears and entreaties of his
favourite daughtei, still she should be
the forfeit, by which that pardon should
be purchased—and without her, life
would be irksome, and devoid ofa single
charm to attach him to it.
< Independent of this, too, the inex­
orable temper of the Prince of Brazil,
precluded every hope ; lie had made a
vow that the murder of his nephew
should not go unrevenged, and be the
assassin who he might, justice should
take its course. From him, therefore,
no clemency was to be expected : him
no tears, no entreaties, could move; he
loudly ' called -for retribution,— surely
then, death would be inevitable, and he
'must lose his Elvira for ever,—this was
the more galling, as it was reported, tliat
the King haddt in contemplation to ap-

ply to the Pope to grant, a dispensation
of her marriage with Montalban, and to
unite her afterwards to Alonzo,
She would, probably, on some future
day, be seated on the throne ofPortugal,
where, amidst universal homage and all
the luxuries of regal pomp, she might
forget that such a being had ever existed
as the unfortunate Montalban.
Yet was it not in the power ofthe latter
to prevent all this ?.Had she not already
expressed a desire to fly with him to
some remote part of the world, where
vengeance could never reach them, and
where they could spend the remainder
of their days unknown and unmolested.
Should lie not thus secure her as liis own
for ever,—yes—but what would be the
consequences,—his father’s banishment
and rum.
“ No, no,” -cried Montalban,- ‘ithis

I merit,—myself-alone shall suffer, for
surely, surely there can be none so illi­
beral, so unjust, sóbaselas would breathe
a sentence to sullyhis character because
obloquy and infamy have blasted mine.”
They were now on the eve of their de­
parture, all was finally settled, and this
consideration imparted a degree of sere­
nity to his mind that he had not thought
it capable of receiving; the sombre
shades of twilight were in unison with
his feelings, as he viewed from a window
near which he was seated, the varied
and extensive prospect it-was not likely
he should ever behold again. It was
bounded on one side by a chain of gi­
gantic rocks, whose towering summits
seemed'almost to touch the clouds, con­
cealed at their base by an immense ex­
tent of wood and water, onwhose silvery
THE ASTROLOGER. 215
surface the beautiful luminary of night,
at length unveiling herself from1 amid
the clouds, was radiantly reflected.
On the other side the mind of the
contemplatist was feasted with all the
wild and charming varieties of nature in
their rudest and most pleasing garb.
The rising grounds exhibited the scatter­
ed cottages of the goatherds, which
overlooked the fertile vales and exten­
sive lakes below, while the melody of
the nightingale, and the faint murmur of
a far distant waterfall, gave a softness
and harmony to the sylvan scene that
imperceptibly captivated the senses
Whose are the sorrows and misfor­
tunes that those sublime emblems of the
divinity could not tranquillize ? Where is

this ? Let the most savage and untutored

every shape, will he not feel conscious
that the same Almighty Being who pre­
sides over the boundless immensity of
nature, has also created him, and for his
1_ 4 +
own all-wise purposes, allotted to him
the track he pursues through life, how­
ever rugged, or however smooth?
Can the civilized bosom withhold this
confession, or through the changes and
vicissitudes, joys and woes, we are
here destined to experience, lose his
trust m that God whose attributes lie
dares not deny, and whose unsearchable
ends he may not pry into, whose eye
sees through the darkness of night as
clearly as the noon-day, who watches
our actions, who shields the innocent
from harm, and turns the guilty to re­
pentance.
To Montalban this great truth forcibly
recurred, he felt asuf his soul was di­
lated with..ideas entirely new, and he
dwelt with rapture on an axiom so unde­
niable, and so calculated to lessen the
weight of sorrow that oppressed him.
THE ASTROLOGER. 217
A train of mournful, but not unpleasing,
reflections arose as he reviewed his past
life; for, though numerous had been his
sms, the mercies of Heaven were still
more so, and he despaired not of those
mercies being extended to him, for his
penitence was indeed sincere.
Since his arrival in France the image
of the cloistered Donna Olivia del Zorio
was seldom absent from his mind; the
treacherous part that had been acted
towards her was still fresh in his me­
mory, and even the consciousness that
he had been but'the agent of the Queen
m that nefarious business, that he had
too been compeltedlto be that agent by
circumstances so"imperious, could not
reconcile him to hiinseif. -Often had he
wished to visit St. Marguerite's convent,
'to gain an interview if possible with
Olivia; avow to her the motives of that

find an excuse far his absence, and pro­

forgiveness, for basely as she had acted

and divest death of all its terrors, for

remained within his:bosom—then should

quailed on earth; but, would Osmin
have presumptuously pretended to; anti­
cipate'the divine will, would he have
dared to promise; the favour of Heaven
to erring mortal? No, no, such-impiety
had never tainted the mind of that holy
man; all he had1foretold had been, alas,
so far, but too exactly fulfilled; yet had
Osmm even lived, the latter part of his
prophecy must have proved fallacious—
every 'hope of happiness on earth was
past.
A quick footstep outside suddenly
interrupted his meditations; he had for­
bidden the intrusion of any person, and
wondered who was thus about to break
m on his retirement. In a few moments,
however; his conjectures were at amend,
the door was flung open, the Princess in
violent agitation, and with a:countenance
of alarm, rushed in, exclaiming, “ Oh
heavens; ' I have seen your father—yes,
Sebastian, the Marcheze himself is be­

that overlooks thehall, where ,1 heard him

Montalban, the colour instantly fading
fromjhis^cheek—“ Now indeed we are
lost ; vengeance only can have brought
him hither; but be composed, my Elvira,
I knew not what I said, you my angel
are'safe. I am prepared for death; I can
meet his frowns; can listen ■ to his re­
proaches and invectives, all, all;' can I
bear with fortitude; but to see you thus
is too much for me.” “ Oh Montalban,
do you preach composure to me at such
a moment as this, when the expectation
of your death is forsooth the consolation
you offer; Talk of composure to the
warring elements, the raving maniac,
but not *to me : no, no, if 'mercy be es-

sacred, we gonotback to Spain, or going,
we die together.” “ Not so, myElvira,”
said Montalban, assuming an air of tran­
quillity, in order to calm her fears, " my
words-are the mere effervescence of
momentary agitation; let us not hesitate
to return, ;we <will confide in the >
cle­
mency of-the King, and all 1 trust will
yet be well.” .
Very different were his .real feelings
from the hopes he thus professed: he
too well rforesaw the reception that
awaited him at Madrid. To his own
fate he was< resigned.; but ^he* now
dreaded the effects of Elvira’sdisap­
pointed hopes. He well knew how
fondly she loved him, and the conscious­
ness ofit was almost perfecthappiness,
yet now he almost wished that she loyed
him less. .Nay,>the conviction:that he
was hateful to her, would have been
welcome to his heart; for, thenhad he
not felt the fears, that now distracted
him, of her falling a sacrifice to her love

; ^
A servant now entered» to intern them
of the arrival of the Marcheze della Vit-
tonaj- and his requesttobe admitted.
This was indeed the moment that de­
manded all their fortitude and presence
of mind. , Sebastian, notwithstanding
all his reasoning, had not been prepared
for this meeting, and he wished that he
had' not been obliged thus*unexpectedly
to encounter'the1/keen reproaches and

“ Conduct his .Excellenza to the sa­

readily consented to stay ; and Sebas­
tian, having adjusted himself, and1sum­
moned all his resolution, descended to
the. saloon.
1 ThedMiarcheze was slowly pacing the
room,.his arms folded •pensively across,
and ,his eyes bent intently towards the
ground.. On Montalbante entering, he
suddenly raised them, and started, as if
they had encountered some hideous and
loathsome object. The latter had. never
so acutely felt how degraded guilt makes
us appear even to ourselves, nas at this
moment. He stood abashed, dreading
to meet another glance, from,which, had
death instantly snatched- him, it would
have been almost as welcome.
At; length* however, after a dong and
painful silence, he ventured »to speak.
4‘ Oh, my father,” faltered’5he; “ i f by

rupted the Marcheze, with an indignant
scowl; “ do, not thus insult me, nor

longer have any claim to that titles and,

My son should be a man of honour,

more*noble than his title. You, sir, are
a villain, a traitor, a murderer,.a wretch

, Something like indignation swelled
the bosom of Mpntalban at the seventy
of the Marcheze, which the deep glow
that mantled his cheeks immediately
betrayed ; and fie, felt* for a moment,
almost inclined to resent it> so keen was
the wound it had inflicted; until lie re­
collected that he who had'so:justly re­

though his lips seemed, ready to give
vent to his feelings. >
“ Lost, infatuated,* mistaken' boy/’
continued the Marcheze— “ I perceive
how unwelcome, how galling are these
Upbraidings ; but worse, infinitely-'more
poignant'must be those of your con­
science, if indeed you are not entirely
deafito it.” • /
" Can you then suppose, my lord,
that I am so abandoned, so Hardened1in
vice, as to review without remorse the
crimes my fatal attachment has led'me
to?—No, Marcheze; I am not the wretch
you think me, else would not the tran­
quillity reign within my breast which
arises from the'confidence of Heaven?s
forgiveness; if it deem my repentance
not unworthy of pardon, surely you,’my
lord; will not withhold1yours.” -
" No, no,” cried Vittoria, angrily—
" hope not for mine—I cannot grant it;

“ Let me, hear that name no more!"

years before your birth, then, sir, per­

“ This is. too,much, my lord,” re­
plied Sebastian, unable to contain him­
self longer— “ 1 expected your censure,
your bitterest anger; but was unpre­
pared to parry .such illiberal observa­
tions: guilty as I am, I do not deserve
them. If your heart lias ever been sen­
sible to the charms, the worth, of a
lovely and amiable woman, in whom
you found every virtue and attraction
that can ornament a female, combined;
if:by such a one .you* have ever been,
beloved, conceive the rapture I feltwhen
Elvira, she whom nations have admired,
bestowed her affections on me. ’Twas a
conquest that, 4
monarchs might have
enyied.me; yet I sought her not from
vanity;nor for her exalted rank, but be­
cause $he was every thing my soul could
love ; , and so pure, so fervent was that
love, angels themselves might not have
blushed to own it ; yet many were the
obstacles that opposed, .it ; they were
surely not the mere work of chance—
232 THE ASTROLOGER.
No, no, there is a fate that governs all of
as, and what it ordains will be, unless
the intervention of some higher power
prevent it; so have Elvira and I, great
as is the disparity of our *stations, been
destined to love each other, and hence
have{we been united ; hence, too, must
we so soon part for ever.”
A tear rolled down his cheek at these
last words, and a j heavy sigh accom­
panied it. The Marcheze was softened,
Ins countenance lost much of its severity,
and he had nearly sofarforgottenhim-
self as to take his-hand and say he'for­
gave him.
Montalban observed his emotion, and
also that he averted Ins face to prevent
it;1 if possible, from being seen ; *he
sprang forward, and throwing himself
on his ’knees, he snatched one of the
Marcheze’s hands m his, which he bathed
with his now fast-flowing¡ tears.’ -*<

Against a sight so moving the Mar-
cheze was; not proof; with all his se­
venty he.possessed an excellent'heart:
he gazed for a moment on the weeping
Montalban; paternal affection againire­
sumed its empire in his bosom, and ex*
claiming— “ Yes, Sebastian» my long-
estranged son, I do forgive you,” —he
threwihis arms roundshis neck, and their
tears were;mingled together. hi . ..
Yet, .Sebastian, <I will notideceive

you to cherish a hope which may not
be realized ; my forgiveness is-yours,
but 'twill availyou little; “it cannot gain

; it was
sacred-and irrevocable; he had *pledged

himself by an oath the most binding to
shake off the *feelings of the father; and
see justice fully and rigorously perform­
ed, should Sebastian be proved that most
guilty of human beings—a murderer ;
and such indeed he was by his own con­
fession, ^therefore must his' vow-be pnt
in execution. To the Kinghe had given
a solemn promise to use every exertion
to discover the place whither the Prin­
cess and Sebastian had fled•—and now
that he haddiscovered it by-means ofL
a
correspondent in France, who had ’given
him a sketch of the Conte andContessa

ment; should he thus attempt to screen
his son^from punishment'by counte-*

-There, was* -therefore* no alternative;
butalittW» reflection in some measure
reconciled him to the fate of his son.
Thoughpaternal love had so far gained
ascendency -over every other sentiment
in his besom at the moment he had been
induced7to forgive him, still the crime
remained the same,—still was Mont-
alhan a murderer; and though of prin­
ciples virtuous:and amiable, . the fatal
deed had branded his character with ig­
nominy,—-and none beheld him without
horror , -
...It was)deemed adviseable neither im­
prudently to
« encourage,, nor suddenly
to;checki the^sanguine hope# of Sebas-
tiaifs pardon, ,that :Elvira entertained;
to:do either seemed equally cruel;, but
soon ,they feared.,the,,delusion» would
alas! be no more;, and should they at

would in*ali probability be dangerous to
each. , It1wa$„ therefore, necessary to

sume an appearance of composure that
ill accorded with the state oftheir minds.
Elvira fancied appearances at least more
favourable than otherwise; -the alarm
first excited ;by the arrival of the.Mar-
cheze gradually subsided; her tears
shewed that she deeply*lamented the
unhappiness she had caused to the King
her father, whom she tenderly loved,

■to
speak;*and after a night of painful

knew not how to account to his father
or the Princess for absenting himself ,
naturally concluding that the former
would oppose it, from an apprehension
that it was merely a plan to effect his
escape, for surely it would seem like
such, and to declare the truth was im­
possible, without betraying the Queen.
So that he thought it better to take an
opportunity of1going thither unobserved
or without saying a word to either.
< Now indeed might he have easily es­
caped, had-life appeared worth pre­
serving, thus separated from Elvira foi
ever, or had¡the fear of death been suf­
ficiently powerful to conquer the resolu­
tion he had formed of meeting it. Far
fromhis thoughts,; howeverj was such an
intention; and in‘ order soon to put an
end to any alarm or misconstruction his
absence might give rise to, he pursued
his’way ¡with expedition to the monas­

was seated the Mother Beatrice, with an

exclaimed Montalban, “ But tell me,
'lady, was she, after having taken jthe
veil, quite reconciled to a monastic life9
did she never express a wish to mingle
again with the world?”
“ Ah; Seaor, it was long ere her

disclose it to nobody, until the approach
of dissolution, when:she begged: I would
send the Confessor toher,—andto Father

,,The interview between this affection­

from each other in spite of every law of

struggles and entreaties to be allowed to

ducted' to her apartment, where a high

of mental derangement, and for several
days her recovery was doubtful.

more, he would, have sanctioned their
union, and caused it to be publicly ac­

Spain—for Vittoria, ' though a Spanish
subject, was yet heir to %
the principality
of Vicenza, from which he derived a con-

siderable income, and* notwithstanding
his having.rejected the title of its prince,,
it was in his power to accept it when he,
chose, as the greatest part of his pro­

The resentment that .had so, long in­

riage he deemed so unworthy of hisr
daughter, now vanished; on reflection
lie saw there .was by, no means so great
a:disparity of!rank; for the CondeMon-

The King, in pursuance ofhis promise,
had offered to Vittoria the grant of any
any request he should make, except the
life of his son,'which was not in his
power.
Such an offer, however flattering,
(coming from the lips of his Majesty),
was now of little value, to the Marcheze.
Ambition had been driven from his bo­
som,-where all ndw was tenderness and
sorrow: lie had; not a wish unconnected
with his family. The dignity, and splen­
dour he had once so prized, he would
joyfullyrhave resigned, could his doing
s6 restore Viola to health, and Sebastian
to innocence and happiness. The only
favour he would have asked—the life of
Montalban—he could not grant; and,
with expressions of gratitude- he de­
clined it for the present.
, Meantime, the bull from the Pope,
that, was to disunite the'Conde and
* •

to arrive ; iand it was necessary to dis-
T>ÏE ASTROLOGER* 261
solve their marriage immediately, as
there were now only a few days to
elapse before that fixed for the trial, the
event of which nobody doubted would
be fatal. * : ’
Never before 'had the Spanish5Court
presented a scene of such deep and uni­
versal sorrow. The griefs of theRoyal
Family for the death of the Fnnce of
Asturias, and the present almost hope­
less situation of the Infanta, excited
general sympathy and concern, for they
were equally beloved and reverenced by
their subjects. Nor were they'less
affected-at:the sufferings of the Vittoria
family; by all who knew'them, the
Marcheze was esteemed and respected,
lus daughter caressed and admired,»-and
even the unfortunate Sebastian possessed
too many endearing qualities,^ not to se­
cure the friendship of many. !The voice
friendship, however, was hot calculated
to soothe affliction such as<theirs, which

,, “ Innocent! ” interrupted Sebastian»
with a,wild and almost hysteric cry; but
growingmorecomposed, “ No—no—no,”
continued he, “ Impossible, I murdered

while others were by no means inclined
to believe that Montalban, if innocent,
could be unconscious of it, or that he

the king, whose attention was directed
towards the Marcheze and his son, and
entreated him to open and read aloud
the contents of the packet, which also
being the hand-writing of Don Malvolio,
and witnessed by Uberto, would imme­
diately set aside every doubt, and sa­
tisfy them of the Conde’s innocence of
the crime for which he had been about
to suffer.
In compliance, with this request, the
King, who was easily persuaded infavour
of Montalban, unfolded the paper, and
as soon as the latter was “sufficientlyre­
covered to listen with composure, he
read the following confession of Don
Malvoiio, which he had made on being
betrayed to justice, and caused Uberto
(the mercenary wretch who had brought
him to punishment) to attest it by his
signature,' thus endeavouring to make
every reparation' for his crimes, ' and
prepared the awful state of futurity.

to dispel so dangerous a charm, so ab­

myself the dreadful consequences that
might accrue from the indulgence of it.

considerable circuit. We had left our
horses at some distance'/to prevent their
noise from discovering us in our flight,
and I anxiously awaited the approach of
my victim.
MA rustling noise behind a thicket, a
little lower down suddenly startled us,
and, on looking attentively, we saw to
our dismay, a man half concealed from
our view, standing apparently on some
hostile design, having in his hand the
same instrument of death as mine.' His
back however, being towards us, we
knew he had not perceived us, and we
could, unseen, .distinguish all his move­
ments, but to discover who he was, was
impossible!
1^ At first I would have instantly fled,
the possibility of the stranger's detecting
us, rushing on my mind with all 'the
terror it could inspire; nay, I even
suggested that he might perhaps have
«ecreted himself there for that purpose; '

all the nefarious transactions in which
she had been concerned, under the in-
fluence of the Queen, before she had
entered the convent. She confessed m
the most penitent terms, the part she
had acted so unsuccessfully, to win the
love of Mortimer for her Majesty, after
the siege of Gibraltar. The treachery
she had carried on against the Infanta,
with regard to the Duca del Marino,—
the duplicity she had long practised to­
wards the Conde Montalban ; and ended
by making known the stratagem by
which she had been conveyed to St.
Marguerite^,—and the severities she
had at first'been obliged to endure there,
—allowing, however, that theyhad even­
tually proved the means of herconvei-
sion, and in her expiring moments, were
therefore remembered with pious grati­

fully to her; but Dominique soon after­
wards paid' the debt of nature—death
cut short his intention of visiting Spain
himself and, has we have before related,
he delegated the important trust to
another.
-'“ What means this base and traitor­
ous composition, madam V' demanded
the King, appearing to discredit it, -and
trying to concealhis indignation; “ who
hasthus dared to insult our royal dignity

Being still on her knees, the King now
attemptedto raise her; whiteall present
were equally shocked atfbeholding their
Queen in this éuppliant 'attitudè, and at
hearing-thëéé ambiguous expressions. <

She burst into tears as she finished
the last sentence; and the Duchessa del
Marino, rushing forward, supported he1
in her arms, asfshe seemed ready to
fall.
Awed ;by the angry voice and manner
of the.King, Rosario had hitherto conti­
nued? silent; but?the scene now became
truly distressing and embarrassing to all,
who, except him, would instantly have
withdrawn, fearful that their presence
would be thought obtrusive and, un­
pleasant, had not the Queen expressed
awish that they should remain.
“ In mercy go not thus,” said she; ;

A tear, was visible in every eye at the
humiliating situation of the Queen, while
she briefly recounted the particulars of
what Olivia had confessed, and peni­
tently acknowledged the ,treacherous
and guilty part she had acted.

the. Marcheze della Vittoria; “ now do 1

the Queen therefore withdrew to her
apartment:with thè Duchessa, and Ro­
sario would also have departed at the
same time, had he not befen detained by
the King, who was desirous of having
some conversationwith him,
i“ Holy Father/'?said his Majesty,

“ Ohmy kind; my generous Sovereign,”
replied Rosario, and-as he spoke, tears
of gratitude flowed down his aged
cheeks; f‘ how have I deserved Jthe
favour of royalty ; how, merited such

condescension and ' goodness ? In pre­
serving Montalban, I have/ been but the
agent of a higher Power ^nought have !
done, but what was one of the imperious
duties of my station ; what gratitude
bound me,to do; what justice demanded,
and what fate decreed! ! !” .
“ Almighty Powers ! ’tis he,” ex­
claimed Montalban wildly ,* “ and thus
is/all fulfilled.” ,Forgetful of every cere­
mony^and, etiquette observed in the
royal presence, he obeyed -the genuine
impulse of his heart, and rushing for­
ward, he threw himself at the feet ol
the monk a second time. “ Oh let me

embrace and bless thee, my earliest,

my guardian ; my preserver ; for every
thing thou didst foretellhath happened,

senger of happiness and joy to me.”
“ Thou art not deceived, my son,”
replied the monk, “ I am he who ven­
tured to foretell thy destiny, on the
memorable Eve of San Sebastian, yet,
if all that I predicted hath not come to
pass; if m one instance 1 1have o’er-
stepped the bounds of-nature, or of

cowl which had hitherto almost com­
pletely veiled his face, slid off; and
discovered to the astonished'and horror*

O SM IN was a native of Gibraltar, born
of respectable parents, whose circum­
stances in his earlier years were suffi­
ciently ample to afford >
him the means
of acquiring such an education as Ins
natural talents seemed to entitle linn to ;
in the cultivation ofthose talents no ex­
pense was spared, nor opportunity lost;
he diligently applied himself to the
study of the occult sciences of nature,
and so rapid was the progress;he made,
that he soon became an object of envy
to his competitors; of wonder and ad­
miration to his friends.
THE ASTROLOGER. 305
Soon after the death of his parents,
however, a series of domestic losses and
calamities compelled him to quit his
birth-place— to seclude himself,from the
world, and bury that brilliant genius, so
long and sojustly admired, in thesolitude
of a monastery. ’
There he soonattracted the particular
notice of its patrons, the family of Vit-
toria; and so great was the reputation
his literary acquirements Jiad gained
him amongst the community, that his
society was almost constantly desired'at
the Castello; and to his care, and that
of the Abad Francisco, was intrusted
the education of the young Conde Mont*
alban. ?
The docility, gentleness, and-aftiiable
qualities of their youthful charge,' w^re
not long in securing him a place in their
hearts, , He won their warmest friend­
ship and esteem ; andi independent of
their gratitude and respect for his family,
they felt so high a degree of interest

excellence and worth could have in­
spired^ ; ; >
With increasing years, however, the
anxiety withwhich Osmin watched over
his beloved pupil increased also; and at
length their mutual confidence induced
the former to reveal his prophecy con­
cerning him, and warn him of what fate
had menaced him with at his birth.
The siege of Gibraltar now rapidly ap*
pacoaching rendered Osmin more fearful
for the safety of our hero ; but, as the
reader has already been informed how
the¡communication of the Astrologer was
received at the Castello, we shall merely
relate the particulars of his exilement
fromtheConvent of San Sebastian.
..The Marcheze, actuated by resent-
ment at Osmin’s having presumed to
predict unhappiness to his noble house,
immediatelyemployed his influence with
theiheads of the monastery to have him
pfrivaitely'banished.
THE ASTROLOGER. 307
Conscious that none durst oppose his
authority, or question’his will, he made
known his wish in terms almost impe­
rative* In sorrow and' dismay the rest
of the Monks heard the sentence pro­
nounced ; and; 'oh ungrateful requital for
the care, attention, andlove, with which
he had guarded the youthful days of
Vittorias heir. The unfortunate Osmin
was sent from the convent on the fol­
lowing day.
*Thus driven again oh that unfeeling
world he had long before determined to
abandon for ever, still dii the ingrati­
tude of the Marcheze not diminish!his
attachment ; and, regarding Montalban
with almost the feelings of a father,,he
resolved to revisit Gibraltar in disguise,,
a place once so dear to him—and where;
he could yet, unseen, enjoy the pleasure
of beingsnear him* ; ' : ., ,

seeing their Majesties, he shortly dis­
covered; the impression the- attractions
of the handsome Mortimer* had made
on the bosom, of the Queen, part of
whose conversation with Donna Olivia
he had accidentally overheard.
Thunderstruck at the impropriety of
such sentiments, the astonished Monk
resolved.,to watch? secretly the progress
of;this .affair; and several privatelpas-
sages in the Gastello,' known but to few,
enabled^him to do so with safety.
The reception?her letter to Mortimer
had met he easily guessed, on hearing
her horrible proposal tb cut him off by
poison; ‘ ! -
-To intimidate her, and prevent such a
deed, he could devise no other plan‘than
either to inform the! King, or the one
whose life wasthus in danger—;or to re­
main concealed in a passage adjoining

the chape], whither'she was daily in the
habit of going, and there, if possible,
deter her from her purpose by a warning
apparently supernatural. . The latter
seemed to him the most adviseable, and
he forthwith employed this .stratagem.
Such was the mysterious being who
caused so much alarm to her and Donna
Olivia.
Many local circumstances hadattached
him to the neighbourhood of the con­
vent; and, at the conclusion of the siege,
he returned thither, and took up his
abode within a short distance of it, m
an obscure cavern hewn m the rocks,
that bounded on one side the forest-of
Vittoria; where he hoped, in.thedisguise
he had assumed, to remain free from
all danger of being discovered by the
Marcheze.
There, for a considerable time, he
subsisted on the charity of the inhabit­
ants of> an adjacent village, as he durst
not venture to shew hiltriself at the mo-

nastery î' and-there too; by somemeans,
he learned the secret ofMontalban’s love
for the Princess, f This .discovery filled
him with r"more disquiet than even his
own;banishment and sufferings. He saw
at once that it was the forerunner of
misfortune and sorrow, and that his pro­
phecy would indeed be fulfilled; for now
that he and Montalban were so com­
pletely separated, it was impossible, by
admonition, to prevent the growth of
what he deemed so dangerous a pas­
sion; and, in'the caution, he was con­
stantly obliged to observe, with regard
to his concealment, he had few opportu­
nities even of hearing what was passing
at the Gastello, where the PrincessdEl-
vira now was.
Venturing, however, one evening to
extend his walk, having learned that the
Marcheze had not yet left Madrid, he
had reached ;;a little grove adjoining the
garden, when his attentionwas suddenly
roused‘by; the appearance>
of the Gonde,

who, witha.the Abad Francisco, crossed
the path a little below him, so engrossed
by conversation that they did not per-
‘ ceivehim. They.were proceeding hastily
towards the Gastello—and, following
them at a short distance, taking care,
however, that they should not observe
him, he saw Montalban unlock a gate
leading into the garden, which they both
entered.
Wondering what the purport of the
Abad’s visit could be, a suspicion of the
truth flashed across, his mind; yet he
tried to chase away the idea, still fancy­
ing a thousand other causes, .until, wan­
dering on almost unconsciously, he at
length found himself at the gate; the
key had been forgotten in it*—it was
merely closed.’ This was a favourable
opportunityto discoverwhat had brought
the'Abad hither. It seemed even more
than theieffect of chance ;i no ;common
or idle curiosity'impelled him. -Mont­
alban was foremost in his thoughts; and

the imprudent measures he might have
been.hurried into by his love for Elvira,
and which Francisco might have sanc-
tioned—it almost seemed as if he was
destined to'prevent them. With this
idea he cautiously entered. His con­
jectures were but. too well founded; he*
saw the Conde, the Abad, and the Prin­
cess, go into’ the chapel—for what pur­
pose there was no room for a doubt.
To snatch Montalban from the gulf he
was, thus about to precipitate himself
into, there was mow -but,one remedy in
his power. . That-lie immediately tried;
and the mysterious voice that, the reader
may' remember, interdicted the cere­
mony which Francisco was commencing,
was no otherlthan that of Osmin. .' ,
It appeared, as if * that unfortunate
exile had been appointed by fale to
watch over the actions of!Montalban,
for, *on the, Eve of San:Sebastian, he it

All this was done without the know­
ledge of the Marcheze, who bestowed
not a thought on the fate to which he
had consigned him; and, the piousOsmin
had just entered his new ofliee, when,
with amazement and horror, he recog­
nized in one of the unhappy beings com­
mitted to the Inquisition, the Conde
Montalban, and learned the enormous
crime with which that nobleman was
charged. Whether it was his early
partiality that now made him regard
the Conde favourably, or that a doubt
of his guilt operated on the mind of the
monk, c&nnot be proved; but certain it
is that, being* perfectly acquainted with

A f t e r expressing his acknowledg­
ments, Rosario withdrew, accompanied
by the Marcheze and,Montalban, who,
thus restored to honour, liberty, and
happiness, in the fulness of his heart
felt as if he could almost have knelt,
down and worshipped his préserver as
something more than human; and had
the latter permitted it, he would have
continued for hours to dwell on this
subject.
.THE ASTROLOGER. . 321
Butin all the enthusiasm of his gra­
titude, .Elvira—she for whose sake he
thus rejoiced to live, was not forgotten.
Hopes, the most sanguine and delight­
ful, nowfilled his bosom; he longed im­
patiently to fly to her—to; assure her of
his innocence. Oh, how delightful to
her ears would be such a sound1—to
tell her that his honour was unsullied—
the opprobrious name of murderer was
his no longer—his father restored; to the
favour of his Sovereign—that she¿might
now, without a blush, own the husband
she had chosen; for surely, he riowihad
every thing to recommend „him,, but
equality of birth, and this might, per­
haps, be oyerlooked; for though he was
a subject, still should he be, at some fu­
ture day, a prince, and that circumstance
would operate in his favour.
These flattering ideas, however, were
the offspring of that excess of joy to
which.he had yielded-himself, and,(
?.s it
subsided, they ’also gradually vanished

He;recollected:lihat rthen’ marriage was

posedp the:wishes of ,the King ^and
Alonzo,, whom he fancied bn the -point
of claiming her as his affianced bride.

greater than any he had hitherto ex­
perienced was preparing for him, and
that all those: chances which had threat­
ened so long to disunite him1fronvElvrra;
were now at an end.
The King and Alonzo remained alone

portance to all ; the particulars of which,
however, he required shouldbe revealed

to whom she was already married—by

of the Infanta, at my instance, there
;were inducements still more powerful
than his love for her. Xour Majesty is
aware that, tas my. nephew, he was pre-
sumptiveheir to the crown of Portugal,
and^as sueh, regarded by me as the one
to whom all its dignities would devolve.
About that period, the Prince of Asturias
was seizedwith that baleful maladywhich
has since proved fatal to him, and which
first gave rise toiour ambitious project.
An alliance wjfch the Spanish crown we
eagerly desjred-rnay, it appeared easily
accomphshed. We aspired still furtlier;

hopeless-rno doubtof his-speedy- death

deep-laid-plans. * Orlando, Jn:.'marrying
Elvira, was?to have ¿usurped, the female
right of.succession—he was.to have em­
ployed every stratagem to have his pre­
tensions sanctioned, and- then to have
united the whole kingdom* to that of
Portugal, thus •exterminating the glory
of the . Bourbons, and rendering, both
countries entirely,siibject to one-govern-
ment—to his, own. - In this enterprise—
(the burning blush of shame crimsons
my cheejc to own it,) he was to have re­
ceived powerful auxiliaries from me. Of
their failure we entertained, not a fear ;
the deepest policy—the soundest judg­
ment, our plans were founded on—and
but for Orlando’s fall at that very critical
time, «// would have been accomplished,

been baffled, yet'did I not despair;—I
vowed to pursue his mtirderer-with ven­

on those faces beamed smiles of joy ;
and all seemed eager to testify their
' feelings to the Conde Montalban on so
happy an occasion. ~ ^
To render it complete, as well as to
have preparations -made for the speedy
union of his daughter with Don,Manuel
d’Orellez, ¿he Marcheze determined to
set out on the ensuing day for the
Castello della Vittoria in order/ to con­
duct the lady Viola back to Madrid,
naturally anticipatingthe salutary effects
this intelligence of .her^beloved brother
would be productive of.

T o the Queen and the Huchessa del
Marino, devolved the pleasing task of
communicating the events ofthe evening
to Elvira. As they entered her apart­
ment, she hadjust awoke fromanuneasy
slumber, in which her disturbed imagina­
tion Kad represented Montalban already
prostrate beneath the stroke of the exe-

cutioner,—Iliahead already severed from
his bleeding body. This idea gave a
frightful wildness; to her countenance
that at first alarmed them ; she fancied
they came to announce the fatal deed;
and her agitation was so great that they
found much difficulty in composing her.
She was at Jength restored to reason on
hearing that Montalban yet lived, but
it required?the utmost caution to disclose
the rest, to inform her of his innocence ;
that he had not only; been acquitted and
pardoned by the; Kihg, ,but that their
marriage had now received the royal
sanction, and they were to be again
united, never more to part.
A sudden transition from excessive
grief to joy wcdd, they feared,, prove
dangerous, and it was not until she; was
perfectly calm that they ventured to ac­
quaint her of all that had occurred.

His whole appearance was -altered from
the pallid hue of sickness/subh as he
had worn when last they saw him, to
the.handsome and manly glow of health ;
he was no longer the delicate and almost
enervated being they had so carefully
nursed;, he looked all health, happiness,
and beauty; and his’ rustic admirers
could not possibly have seen him to
greater advantage. ■
Even;in the midst of illness there was
in his deportment something so noble,
dignified, and interesting' that they had
often declared’ they had never before
seen so handsome a cavalier.
Seeing • him, however,,accompanied
by Viola; their''generous benefactress,
(whom they did not yet know to be his
sister,) respect predominated over every
other feeling his appearanceJexcited ;
and while their tongues acknowledged
the honoirr this visit conferred on them,
