I looked up and saw a dark tunnel with the same bright light I saw when I was 11 and very sick. I saw my mom and dad standing on each side of the tunnel. Both are now deceased, but were alive at the time of this NDE. Again, I was pulled towards the light and felt a warm glowing light surround me. I had no worries. Time seemed to stop and I had no ill feelings of want or need or hurry. It felt amazing and wonderful. I knew I was headed home, as it seemed that way. The next moment I woke up with the drill instructor standing over me. It was rather disappointing when I realized where I was.

    	Experience Description 5067  					</p>  					I can recall that I saw a bright light and was absorbed into the light. From this, I only recall walking and talking to Jesus. I didn't seem to have to talk, because it was simply understood between him and me. Also, we were walking on a shimmering road that was translucent, yet not totally. I don't recall music at all, but I was concentrating on Jesus. We didn't talk all that long, but it is pretty vivid to this day. I was upset and disappointed that he said I had to go back. He said I still had things to do in my life -nothing specific, though. I realized later on that I was to go on to help others in combat and various military experiences.

As time went on, I tried to see if the experience was related to anything else and other people. I told a few people, and there were a couple that had had similar NDEs.
