The adults paired up with the younger kids who could not swim. No one chose me. As they swam away, I stepped into the lake. Almost immediately, I sank to the bottom of the lake. Not only did I not feel any distress such as the need to breathe, but I felt so loved and so comforted. As I looked in the distance underwater, I noticed twirling water that became a tunnel. At the end of the tunnel, I saw a beautiful white light. The light was so beautiful that I was drawn to it. I wanted to be closer. I have never felt such love and peace since. Suddenly, I felt someone pull me upward, out of the water. That same instant, I felt a great loss and I was sad.  I wanted to feel that comforting feeling again. Only after being pulled out of the lake did I have the need to choke and cough up water.
