my name is
george a feiler the third i don&#39;t
normally use a third
but i was in the u.s air force and
my final rank was major
i don&#39;t know what else you&#39;d like to
know have an mba
and as a former vice president of medcor
in other words i&#39;ve done other things
since
leaving the air force
i was a navigator
in various aircraft tanker and
transport aircraft flew last in c141s
at mcguire air force base i was also an
intelligence officer
most of my career as my
desk job so to speak and i in that
period frequently you know
brief generals and congressmen on
our capabilities and the threat to our
forces
well i was normally like i mentioned a
briefing officer
and i would come to work four o&#39;clock or
so in the morning
and on the morning of january
18 1978 i
drove through the main gate at mcguire
and i noticed
that there was red lights out on the
runway
and that probably something was going on
on the runways there because of all the
red lights and you know like police cars
and fire trucks and so on
and didn&#39;t think too much about it until
i got to 21st air force
command post is where i worked
and i would go in there and prepare a
briefing
generals i was a
deputy director of intelligence for 21st
air force
which controlled well half the
military aircraft and flew the
presidents
and various vips and
from the mississippi river around india
we had some 300 aircraft and
we were flying all kinds of missions
submarine crews almost anything that had
to do with the
military airlift we accomplished
and this particular warning when i went
into the command post
i was met by the head of the command
post and he said they&#39;ve been a very
exciting evening that we&#39;ve had ufos
in the you know over the maguire all
night
and that one had apparently landed
or possibly crashed at four dicks
and that when a middle
military policeman came upon the
alien that he had pulled out a gun and
shot them
and i said you know a foreigner like you
know an alien i was a little bit
confused by him saying
alien he says no an alien from outer
space he was very
specific about the fact that an alien
from outer space had been shot at
fort dix and that it had
run away after being wounded
and headed for maguire now maguire
and fort dix just have a fence between
them and
this alien supposedly climbed the fence
or went under whatever and
got to maguire and died out on the end
of the runway
and the security police were out there
and had captured the body so to speak
and we&#39;re guarding it and he said that a
c-141 from wright patterson was coming
in to pick up the plane
now that made me stand up because i
didn&#39;t realize that
right patterson had c-141s i thought
military airlift command was the only
one
who owned a c-141 aircraft
so i was like you know my gosh what&#39;s
going on here he says we want you to
brief this at the you know
stand up general briefing this morning
and
explain what happened to everybody and i
was
like do you want me to tell general tom
seidler
and everybody in the command post that
you know we captured an
alien and they said yes we want you to
believe
brief that this morning well i did some
checking around and i called the
438th military airlift wing command post
to check with them to see if
in other words the story was the same
that i was getting and they said yes
that that
they had heard that also that this
actually did happen that
an alien was found on the base
and later that morning
i was told that they decided not to
brief it in the stand-up briefing
and so i didn&#39;t i didn&#39;t actually brief
it
now the only other thing that was
interesting is that
that morning i carried what&#39;s code word
down to the general sandler&#39;s office
and i noticed some commotion going on in
there
and that some of the security police
people were there
in rather disheveled and so on and that
general sandler was a stickler for
everybody looking perfect
and it was kind of surprising to see
these people that obviously needed
shaves and were in fatigues and so on
there
so then i knew that some that that might
tie into the story that i had heard
now after the briefing i also went to
the
photo lab almost every day i went to the
photo lab because in your briefings you
have
well four screens and you have to keep
them all
you know filled up with pretty pictures
and so on and
there they indicated that they had taken
pictures of something extraordinary and
i said well let me see him
and the sergeant was handing it to me
and his master sergeant says he can&#39;t
see those
so all i know is that there they had
some pictures that i wasn&#39;t allowed to
see but
normally being the generals briefer
i had never been you know stopped from
seeing any pictures that they had
previously there is nuclear assets on
on the base that they used to carry uh
weapons back and forth to europe and so
on
when i had done some checking around
because i became interested
i talked to one of the security
policemen who claims to have been out
there
and he indicated that he essentially saw
a small body that you know could have
been a
could have been like a child but it
seemed to have a larger than
normal head now one interesting thing is
many of the
key personnel on the base at that time
who had a connection to this with this
were
quickly transferred from the wing
commander on down
indicating that if
you know you knew something you want
they tended to split you
up so to speak so you couldn&#39;t talk
about it oh within a matter of weeks or
whatever
now the security policeman told me that
he was transferred within a few days
matter of fact he was taken to wright
patterson
within the day or two and debriefed by a
number of
people and essentially told not to talk
about it anymore
now his his story to me was that
you know they heard this going on on the
radios and they
heard that this chase was on that the
alien had been shot at fort dix and was
they were chasing it towards maguire at
least for whatever reason
it was it chose to run towards
maguire air force base and that
both the state police and the
military police were you might say
chasing this
person or alien whoever it was they came
from what looked like a
ufo as i understand it was a dis-shaped
crap
they indicated to me that the ufos had
been in the area for quite some time
that evening and that they had him on
radar and that the
tower operator had seen them and
some of the other aircraft
in the area had apparently seen them as
well
six or eight people guarding the body
and then there was the commander of the
security police unit unit and then we
were told a few of us in the command
post
and i assume that general sadler was
briefed about him
well i happened to meet a lady who
claimed to have been out of white sands
and it was a an engineer
working out there and she was out hiking
one day
and she told me that her and a couple of
her friends
had come up to the top of a hill
and they could look down in this valley
but only their heads were
showing you know on the top of the hill
they just happened to be looking over
and down the way the
path was and they had seen a ufo
on the ground with a couple little
aliens kind of like picking up rocks and
stuff
and they watch it for an extensive
period it was uh
you know several hundred yards away from
them and they got a pretty good look at
it
and eventually they did the aliens did
see them
and the craft they jumped in the craft
and took off
but i had personally never seen anything
until about
1962 we were flying tankers
over england and london control asked us
to intercept
a ufo and we happened to be done with
our refueling mission
and you know we accepted the assignment
we were on the just over the north sea
and they asked us to fly to the center
of england
and we were doing i don&#39;t know some 400
miles an hour and a dive down to
intercept this object and they
gave us headings you know
and it was pretty much hovering in the
rough stonehenge area
oxford stonehenge area and
we got about not exactly exactly sure 20
30 miles out
and i got it on radar and it was a very
large return
we used to fly up by the fourth the
firth
of fourth bridge which is kind of like
the san francisco bay bridge but it&#39;s a
very large bridge
and the return was similar to that
and size and in other words it was a
very large radar return
and obviously london control had it on
their radar and they were vectoring us
to this object and
when we got about a mile from it as a
matter of fact we were diving on the
thing and the whole aircraft was shaking
and it just took off into space
several thousand miles an hour almost
directly up
and uh now this was at night it reminded
me a lot of the
shuttle launch you know something going
up
very quickly the high rate of speed
and frankly at least to my knowledge we
had nothing like that
nothing like that capability matter of
fact we said something about
uh you know how many kind of rocket
launches from that area and they said
now that
uh we can just go continue on our
mission
so based on this lady&#39;s
testimony and pretty much what we saw
i believe that there was something you
know going on out there
my best guess is that it was a disc type
craft
but a fat disc at least there was lights
you know something like this at the top
and at the
at the bottom it was more than just
a straight plate-like object it had
a dome on top on the top of them if the
radar
return was accurate it was probably
you know just guessing
500 yards long or something i mean a
huge huge thing
something that bothered me a little bit
that they were very friendly as we&#39;re
doing the intercept on the thing and
once once the intercept was made and it
had
essentially we chased it away they
didn&#39;t want to talk about it any further
we wrote it in the uh the navigator&#39;s
log
fairly detailed yeah this is briarwood
lake in medford new jersey
and
we had just moved into this house in any
case
we were asleep about i&#39;m just guessing
three o&#39;clock in the morning and
sleep with my wife and suddenly the room
got very bright
in the middle of the night so i
got up out of bed and opened up the
shade but
most of the light was even coming
through the shade
and looked outside and i don&#39;t know if
most people have seen a submarine
surfacing with all the water coming off
well this was like a disc about 30 feet
in diameter
surfacing and
what looked to me like water coming off
of it
but frequently i had flown the atlantic
and
pacific and so on and seen the aurora
borealis
or the northern lights and around the
craft
where there&#39;s ionization very similar to
the
aurora borealis and it just kind of
moved across the uh the lake for a while
and flew off at a fairly high rate of
speed
now because of that
i&#39;ve checked with a lot of the neighbors
and there&#39;s
i don&#39;t know the exact numbers but
there&#39;s like 40 or 50 lakes in
medford and medford lakes and
i frequently brought up the subject if
they&#39;d seen anything
and it&#39;s amazing how many people have
actually seen
craft on the lakes well occasionally i
used to
brief on the ufo sightings
that had been occurred around the world
to the generals
one that sticks out in my mind is 1976
there was a
famous sighting in tehran iran
where an f4 or a couple f4 is chased it
you have a
that kind of the sighting i would
brief on occasion to the generals and
they would be you know more or less
interested
then then someone would stop by and say
well you know i had my
sighting we were flying 106s over
colorado or whatever and we dove
on the ufo sitting there very similar to
my story
except i was in a four engine tanker and
they were in a
you know two fighters and they would
dive on the thing
at that time this particular colonel was
telling me that
the f-106 had set the world&#39;s record for
speed and they had these
aircraft going as fast as they could
such as big diving on this
ufo that was hovering in a valley in
colorado
and just like us when they got near the
craft it
took off and left them standing still
and they were doing like 1500 or
something
whatever the top speed was at that time
for these aircraft in the dive
that these who you know is flying these
have this capability that is far
beyond anything we&#39;ve had for years and
years i think even today
something at least in my opinion
non-human
that has a different form of propulsion
and is
coming here and you know
we&#39;re doing reconnaissance and taking
minerals or whatever it is that they
happen to be doing
there are things going on and they are
being seen you know
talked to a number of astronauts who
have seen them talk to
other military pilots and the like who
have seen them and
i remember captain ramage
who i used to work for
in athens greece and he had one
during the korean war fly right off his
uh
wing stay with him for like an hour
and do not only off his wing but do you
know
acrobatic things around his aircraft
and i i don&#39;t know the exact percentage
of people but probably
ten percent of the pilots and air crews
that you ask about it to have had
sightings a few years ago
a colonel who was an intelligent was in
intelligence
had his whole b52 crew see it
and uh now you know these people don&#39;t
you might say volunteer and sit in front
of the camera and tell about it but
there&#39;s an awful lot of people who have
seen them
they&#39;re not sure exactly what they are
and what they&#39;re doing but they know
that they have
advanced capability and they usually see
some kind of a
you know solid object that appears to be
made of some kind of metal
usually a gunmetal gray usually with
particularly at night people usually
report
various lights around them it seems to
me i was told that it was
put in some kind of a you know casket
type thing
and uh and and
taken away so to speak flown away
i think that in 1947 or in that
time frame something crashed
out in out west you know whether it was
roswell
the specific roswell that&#39;s been written
about
but i think something happened out there
at least
based on you know that you might say the
talk in the military that
some something crashed sometime out
there the tendency is to make things
classified when you don&#39;t know what&#39;s
happening
you know secret top secret or whatever
and if it comes down from the president
it&#39;s a very high classification
probably code word above top secret
in other words neat no that kind of
thing and once that
caveat or designation is put on
something
it&#39;s very difficult to get it downgraded
i mean you can go to the archives and
despite what they tell you
they have things going back
the second world war that you still are
not allowed to look at
and once these things are
top secret or whatever it&#39;s difficult to
get it done
it just kind of moves on and forever
stays top secret or whatever
they just keep it very classified and
very secret
basing it on you can embrace it on the
fact for example that uh
let&#39;s say this craft had advanced
technological capabilities
so you don&#39;t want the other side so to
speak to know
what you know and how these things work
in the light
it&#39;s to your advantage to keep this
secret i think that
it&#39;s time that these various programs
come out now one of the things that i&#39;ve
found
is that the way it&#39;s been kept
secret to a big extent is the fact
of through ridicule if it always had
been just top secret
i think most of the world would know
about it tonight
but they put in a kind of a ridicule
factor
which made people you you&#39;ll hear
somebody telling a story like this
they&#39;ll say well he must be crazy that
he believes in ufos
but and they brought this out when
anyone saw anything
you know there&#39;d be two people we&#39;ll say
one has a funny hair
and looks wild and so on and the guy
standing next to him as a police officer
well they always interviewed the wild
guy
and never put the police officer on the
screen my experience has been an awful
lot of policemen have seen these
and also awful lot of fbi have seen
these an awful lot of military has
seen it and he might be having the
like at times i used to carry nuclear
weapons
in other words i was
mentally fit to carry nuclear weapons
but i&#39;m
not mentally fit if i see a ufo well
this criticism
and this ridicule has i think done more
to keep the story coming out than almost
anything else
was indeed a solid structured craft in
the air
it was traveling at a phenomenal speed
compared to
the envelope as it were of
our own fighters so jets were launched
and indeed the pilots did manage to
close
and get a visual sighting on
