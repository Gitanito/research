  		              		Experience Description   

    At age 13, I had an uncle who had passed away. He had been deceased for approximately 2 weeks when I had a dream which he appeared in. He told me that I would be involved in a accident around age 16 years old.  Everyone would believe that I would die, but I would survive. I told my mother of the dream because I  was scared. She tried to comfort me by telling me it was just a dream. 

  Fast forward to my 16 birthday. I was constantly worried until I turned age 17.  The day I turned 17, I laughed because I the dream would not come true now. Four days later, my horse open the gate and had  gotten out. I was putting a halter on him and my sister's boyfriend walked up behind him. This spooked my horse and his front legs hit both of my femurs and my right fibula. I was  in the hospital for three months in traction. 

  In the first three days in the hospital, I was suffering from  my arterial blood gas being 28 percent. It  was 8 o'clock am and my doctor left the room. He did not know I was suffering from a fat embolism. My mother left the room to request that he come back to check on me. The nurses could not contact him. A woman came into my room and I will never forget what she said. She apologized for taking too long to come to see me and that she had been extremely busy.  She asked me where my mother was. I told her she went to find a doctor. This woman asked me what the doctors were going to do for me. I stated that I didn't know. She then said that she was going to find someone and  left the room by  exiting through the wall.  

  Suddenly, a doctor who was running late from rounds, came walking down the hall. My mother had asked the doctor to see me, even though he was not my doctor.  He agreed look at me and called code blue. I was immediately sent  to the intensive care unit. 

  I had an NDE.  I saw a light come through the window and  knew the light was coming for someone.  As more of the light came through the window, I knew I was the one the light was coming for. Then I blacked out and found myself traveling at a extremely high rate of speed down a long tunnel. The distance was great and there was a presence  with me. The light knew my every thought. I had an emotional feeling that I  could not control this. My privacy was gone but I could not know everything the light was thinking. I knew only what I was supposed to know. I knew that I was going to the end of the tunnel.  I could see  light at the end of the tunnel that was the size of a pin hole. Then I was given a message that if I went through to the end of the tunnel, that  I could not return. With all my willpower, I said, 'No!'  to keep from going through the threshold. 

  When I came back to my body, I  didn't have control of my body for a little while. I didn't sense evil but the unknown scared me for a couple weeks. I kept thinking  I would leave my body and could not stop leaving if the light came back. I have reflection of this whole event from my dead uncle forwarding me to the light at the end of the tunnel. 

The all-knowing light could carry on a intimate conversation with every living thing on the planet Earth  all at the same time in their own language. It was  thoughts without words, which were never spoken.  It was telepathy. I was never told a name for the all-knowing light, or what his or her title was. I  just knew it was all-knowing.

   I tend now to lean towards believing in reincarnation. 

 My mother said that when I went to the ICU, she walked passed a chapel in the hospital. She  felt like a source was pulling her into pray but as I know she didn't enter because she was heading for the phone to call the family. She was going to tell them to  say their good-byes upon the advice of the doctor.

   I hope this helps people  who read this. I have since dedicated my life to rescuing animals and became a nurse. I think we are here to learn and help Humanity any way one we can. I wanted to give back what was given to me.  I left with disability but many did even have that because  they lost their young lives.  I never forget that.

Then I blacked out and instantly was in the long tunnel. No words can describe the rate of speed I was traveling. But I didn't see the end or the light when I was at the entrance of the end of the tunnel. I only saw it after  I traveled a great distance. When I finally saw the end of the tunnel coming, I saw a bright light that looked like a dot. But it got bigger the closer I came to the end. I didn't have ANY time to decide to not exit the tunnel because there was no return once I cross the exit of this tunnel. I do not know what was on the other side of the end of the tunnel because if I entered it, I could not come back.

  Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a definite conscious decision to return to life.   I was told through telepathy that I could not return if I cross the point to the light at the end of the tunnel. I knew myself that I was not ready to stay there. I wanted to come back and I had to use my willpower to return

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I really never thought much about life and death or religious views at 16 years old. I spent time on the farm playing and enjoy all the farm  

  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     Help all you can in any way you can because it may be yourself that is needing help. I believe that if I can make a difference, I  should always do so  for the good. We are not in this alone.  

  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   The light had a presence and was with me through the tunnel. But I could not see the light in the tunnel with me; just it's presence. I did see the light briefly before going into the tunnel  

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I actually saw them

  During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     I just knew the light held all-knowing from the tiniest fish in the ocean to the horse out in the field,to the universe. I knew he was all-knowing and I  could feel his intelligence  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         No

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   The emotion and feeling of the whole experience could not be described accurately. For example, if you threw a glass at a brick wall, you know it's going to shatter, but you don't say this glass is going to shatter, you just know it.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.    

  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I have been given message from dead people to pass on to their loved ones still here. I also have noticed the Dead come back to make amends with wrong-doing to the people they feel could have hurt.

  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Maybe I lived through the accident and other people have not survive theirs. I feel I have to something or else I would have died also.

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Soon most people. including doctor, find it interesting. But I feel I need to share and I always tell all doctors and nurses that special Angels have their presence in the hospital standing over the patient and staff. Everyone matters.

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was probably real.     Wonderful if in the mind or if it was reality then I think of my dead uncle who told me before the accident happen. I believe now.

  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     Many things have come to me over the years. Too much to explain.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         Pray and be understanding  

  Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         Yes I was told by a great grandma that people born with a birth sack on their head at birth were said to have the gift of sight. Maybe this could be a question like many other religious or beliefs. It would be interesting to know by the way I was born with the birth sack.
