My blood pressure was being taken often and going down, and I thought when it hits zero I'm dead. I had to wait for blood to be matched before going in for emergency surgery.

They wheeled me out of the birth suite and to the operating theatre, and it was then I left my body and started to float. The ceiling disappeared and I was looking at myself being wheeled along on a trolley from a great height down what seemed to be an endless corridor. I felt extremely calm, and found the whole experience wonderful and life changing. I plopped back into my body when the anesthetist started giving me an injection.
