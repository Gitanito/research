  Experience description: &nbsp;         	I met my soulmate when I was very young, only 10.&nbsp;   	He came to my elementary school in the fourth grade as a new student.&nbsp;&nbsp; The   	second I met him I had an instant connection with him, I can still remember   	the first conversation we ever had.&nbsp; (What's funny is that it has always   	been hard for me to &quot;see&quot; or &quot;remember&quot; his face- its more like a seeing   	light or a all bunch of colors at once.)&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a crush on him but I never   	told anyone...&nbsp; I did however write it&nbsp;on the wall behind my favorite   	painting in my room.&nbsp; When you are 10, you have these crushes and they go   	away with time... no one makes too much of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    	&nbsp;    	Eventually as we graduated and got older; and time   	moved on... we lost touch had different friends but he never left my mind.&nbsp;   	When I was fifteen, I had not seen him or talked to him in years,&nbsp; I was at   	this party and I had gone to the bathroom.&nbsp; While I was in the bathroom, I   	felt this intense overwhelming feeling and he popped into my head.&nbsp; I   	remember saying aloud to my friend, &quot;he's here.&quot;&nbsp; Sure enough, when I exited   	the bathroom there he was sitting on the couch and al he did was look at me   	and say my name.&nbsp; But it felt like heaven.    	&nbsp;    	Its weird because we both followed a similar life   	path, dated people at the same time, have similar or the same taste in food,   	books, and life in general.&nbsp;    	&nbsp;    	&nbsp;Around the time I turned 18, he came back into my   	life full force.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coincidentally, he became my solace when I lost my first   	love and he his.&nbsp;&nbsp; My best friend at the time had begun to pursue him, she   	asked us both to go up to her school and visit with her one weekend.&nbsp; Just   	like that out of the blue, he called my parents house and asked me to go   	with him.&nbsp; I thought it weird that he call my parents house instead of my   	cell and wondered how he even got that number, because even my best friend   	did not have it.&nbsp; (Later, I would learn that he had always had my number and   	had been scared to call me.)    	&nbsp;    	Eventually, we found our way to each other.&nbsp; I   	cannot describe in words the feelings of immense happiness and euphoria that   	results when we are together.&nbsp; I have been told that when we are together,   	its like nothing else or no one else exists.&nbsp; We share dreams, share words,   	share thoughts, and along with finishing each other's sentences, we learned   	to write the same too.&nbsp; With him came both intense pleasure as well as   	pain.&nbsp;     	&nbsp;    	We talked about it, years later, and he had felt   	the same way the first time we met. He had felt an intense attraction to me   	that was completely unexplainable.&nbsp; When we are in the same room we are   	unable to stay away from each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can remember times when he was   	physically ill at the thought of us being separated, breaking up, for many   	days until I went to him.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same for me.&nbsp; I think about calling him,   	pick up the phone and realize that it is ringing and he is on the other   	end.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a time where he went into a period of intense sadness and   	depression; and no one could reach him, one night he disappeared.&nbsp; I   	remember being on the highway, and just thinking that he needed me... so I   	turned around (over a median) and drove north on the interstate, got off an   	exit, and went to the train station.&nbsp; I jumped out of my car, ran onto the   	platform and sure enough there he was- and he did need me.&nbsp; He said later   	that he had been thinking about me the whole time...    	&nbsp;    	We have been apart for sometime now.&nbsp; I miss him   	immensely; and have realized that I am unhappy without him in my life.&nbsp; I am   	not sure if any of this will supersede the differences and atrocities&nbsp;that   	brought us apart.&nbsp; But as I write this, I prepare to call him, and speak to   	him...    	&nbsp;    	Even though we have been apart...&nbsp; I have seen him   	several times.&nbsp; We live nearly&nbsp;200 miles away from each other and each time   	I visit NYC (which is about 3x a year) I see him crossing a street, driving   	by, or sitting in a cafe.&nbsp; Even today, as I pondered whether to reach out to   	him, a myriad of signs became evident...&nbsp; the song he used to sing to me in   	the morning came on my alarm clock this morning, our favorite movie, a book   	I haven't touched in years fell off my bookshelf; and there was a note from   	him inside of it; and of course there are the dreams I have been having for   	the past three weeks...&nbsp; all of him.&nbsp;     	&nbsp;    	Wish me luck.&nbsp; I hope this is interesting to you:)    	&nbsp;    	Jenny
