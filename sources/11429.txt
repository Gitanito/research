  		              		Experience Description   

    My experience happened in the summer of 1974. I  had just turned 10 years old.  A friend and I were on our way through fields on our bicycles. We had ridden  rather far away from our homes when my friend remembered that he needed to be home soon. As he didn't want to arrive late, he started to speed up. As I didn't want to bve left behind, I was also speeding after him. In order to get home, we had to cross a federal highway with high traffic. My friend was crossing this road with great speed, I was about 20 or 30 meters behind him.  I kept my gaze on him, so I would not to lose him and  crossed the road shortly after he did.

  Suddenly, I found myself several meters high above the road. I never experienced anything of the crash. I remember seeing the light blue, VW-beetle car. But, then I found myself immediately above the road. Below, I saw a VW-beetle car and a desperate young man bending under the engine cover. From my vantage point, I also could see through the car, the engine cover and the engine. I also noticed my feet sticking out from under the car. Then I watched as the young man was pulling  my body out from under the car. 

  As soon as he had completely pulled my body out from under the car, I was suddenly back in my body. To the utmost surprise of the young man, I simply got up, took my now totally wrecked bicycle  and was running home while dragging the broken bicycle along. Amazingly, I  had a multitude of scratches, but no fractures or other injuries.

  During theexperience, I had no emotions when I saw my body lying under the car. I was an uninvolved observer.

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     As a 10 year old boy at the time,  I didn't feel like I had experienced something unusual. It rather felt like something normal and self-evident. I didn't wonder at all about this out of body experience. But I had a feeling to keep the experience private, and did so for many years. I had no explanation for this.

During the many years after, I always had strange and also wonderful spiritual experiences; one was that I have been standing at the roadside of my life like beautiful flowers.

I also consider  as meaningful, the aspect that in no way I had a feeling of having experienced something special. It felt as if I had been having this experience many times, which definitely wasn't the case.  Also astonishing was that I didn't experience the collision with the car.
