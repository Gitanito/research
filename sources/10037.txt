  		              		Experience Description   

    During my third back surgery, I became completely aware and the memory is as clear as I type this. I was fully cognizant. I figured something went wrong with the surgery because I could see THE light. I saw my grandmother, Agnes, and my wife’s grandmother, Millicent. They looked like the best version of themselves. I realized that I could go if I wanted to do so. Agnes, pointed for me to go back. 

I really hated that mean  woman, but now she’s my guardian angel. She had an incredible energy and used it negatively. She understands better now and I channel the energy she gives me in a positive way.

   So I headed back to my body. I had to concentrate visually. The best I can describe it is it’s like moving through the lightless void of space. I knew to keep looking for my hand in front of me and could eventually hear the nurses calling my name. 

  If you want more visual detail,  I’ll send a video or something because I hate typing and avoid office work at all costs.   					  

Background Information:       

Date NDE Occurred:   	 March 31, 2016  

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Uncertain  Surgery-related.            I didn’t ask, and chalked the experieence up to too much time on propofol.  
  
Did you feel separated from your body?      No    

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         Completely aware, same as I sit here now.    

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         No       

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      No  

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         No       

  Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         Yes     Already answered, except for what was communicated. This is just an experience. All we are is light and color, nothing more.  
  
  Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   I saw  all the pictures - round, bright white, energy moving back and forth. Not really the important part.  
  
Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         No       

  What emotions did you feel during the experience?        I felt an 'aw sh#$t,' moment because something went wrong with the surgery.  
  
  Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about the universe.     
  
Did scenes from your past come back to you?         My past flashed before me, out of my control       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Liberal     

What is your religion now?         Liberal     

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Yes     

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I was already an empath. Now, unfortunately, it’s much stronger. But now, I have better control.  
  
Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          You’ve not had a near death experience, have you?  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Not a great conversation starter. Once again, you ask too much as a simple question.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

  Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         Too much information to share for this platform.  
  
Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         Accuracy is there, but comprehensively lacking.
