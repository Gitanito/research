I was cleaning the undercarriage of a car and it fell off the jack stand. It fell on me and the pinch weld hit my head and knocked me out.


I was aware of the car falling then I felt a bump, like a mall rock hitting my head and then I got up. It was like colors were more than colors. It looked like I could touch them, it felt like the air was silk sheets moving over my body. I felt like I was being watched, and I looked around and saw no one. I then turned around and saw my head bleeding. Then I felt like I was falling and then I was back in my body. My wife soon after, came out screaming for the amount of blood coming out of my head. She drove me to the hospital where I had a minor skull fracture, and I needed six stitches. Other than that I was fine.
