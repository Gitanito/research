    This is my account of my NDE in 1987. I hope this helps.  

  In the Spring of 1987, I was riding my motorcycle on a beautiful Spring evening in Tulsa, Oklahoma. At that time, I was a student at Spartan School of Aeronautics. Little did I know, when leaving the campus, how my life would forever change.  

  I was traveling on Pine Street coming up to the intersection with Memorial Blvd. The traffic ahead of me had stopped at the red light but had started moving through the green light. I proceeded to follow when suddenly, I heard the distinct sound of a accelerating car engine to my left side. Just before entering the intersection, I turned my head sideways, for a clearer view through my full-face helmet, and saw the car running his red light.  

  Everything proceeded in slow motion. The Ford Granada hit me with its speed around 50 m.p.h. On impact, I remember thinking, “This is going to really hurt”. An instant later, almost like a reflex action, I had leapt from my body. I felt no pain. I was looking down at my lifeless body on the highway below. I was confused, but then I realized that I existed -- or my mind existed -- separate from my body.  

  I hovered over my body as the ambulance arrived and the paramedics tried to resuscitate my body. They cut off my shirt and through my jean’s left pants leg to assess a leg and ankle injury. I had no sense of time. I simply watched and listened to everything being said and done from a place above the scene. They strapped me down to a backboard on a gurney, continued working on me, and drove to the hospital. From above, I watched one of the paramedics place my belongings out of their way.  

  During my time being out-of-body, I experienced a feeling of peace like I had never experienced before. I felt this comforting presence that stayed with me as I continued to watch the paramedics resuscitate me. Then I heard the words “It’s not your time yet. You have more to do.” With those words, I was back in my body, struggling to breathe, and experiencing tremendous pain.  

  Upon arrival at the hospital, I tried to communicate what I had experienced to the paramedics and nurses that came to meet the ambulance outside the ER. No one was really listening to what I trying to say, as they were busy working to transfer me from the ambulance to the waiting hospital staff.  

  I got their attention when the lead paramedic of my care began looking for my personal belongings in the ambulance. He was asking the other paramedic where my clothing and shoes were placed. I spoke up and told him that my belongings were placed in a cabinet just off to his right a few feet away behind my head. He looked at me stunned that I was responding to him; then, he was completely shocked I was correct about the cabinet. My belongings were there. He asked me how I knew. I told him I had seen and heard everything being done at the accident scene and in the ambulance. He said that was impossible because I was unconscious and unresponsive.  

  I struggled for answers to what I had experienced. From that day, 32 years ago, I began my metaphysical exploration and education in Near-Death Experiences, and it has changed my life’s choices and directions. This journey added such profound richness to a life, that until that first near-death experience, was a life driven by circumstances and without a real life purpose.
