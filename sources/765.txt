WHEN the noble and the learned author
of the
tlidipus Judaicus determined to
'confine his wonderful discorery of the real
sense ofthe Hebrew Scriptures," no
longer
to the 'Walls of his study, and the circle of
his friends; he made his appeal to' you,
Gezitlernen, as the proper tribunal to decide
on its -merit, and pretensions. Among you
his book has been extensively circulated.
It is purchased with eagerness, vrhen
accidentally exposed to sale: it still ex-
cites 'among yon, great attention, and gives
4
rise to frequent conversation. Under these
circumstances, I have been much surprised
that none of its numerous admirers have
applied the principles of reasoning adopted
'by_Sir William Drummond tothe 'elucida-
tion of other Histories, than those in the
Old Testament, Seven years have elapsed
since it was first submitted to
your appro-
bation, yet its author has never been con-
gratulated by any of his friends, or followers.
Entertaining, as I do, an
equal respect for
his candor, his courage, his fmodefatiou,
his ingenuity, and the
useful object to
which he has devoted his time, his talents,
and his learning ; I trust he will permit me
to assure him, that I consider his disco-
veries too valuable and meritorious to be
reserved only for the literary world. The
public in general always have been, and
ever will be interested in the 'opinions of
~
Z

~@'

their superiors; and I wish therefore; to
gratify their curiosity, _
and enlarge the
peeuliar fame of,S_ir William Drummond,
by proving to them, on his principles, You
being my Judges, that they have as much
misapprehended the sense of History, as
that of Scripture ; and that there is equal
reason to believe the twelve Caesars to be the
twelve Signs of the Zodiac, as that the nar-
ratives of the Hebrew Scriptures are a col#
lection of astronomical emblems.
It has repeatedly been made 'a sub-
ject of applause, that our countrymen
have ever shown themselves averse -»
to
new plans, new systems, and new the-
ories, whether in politics or
religion.
Sir William Drummond, therefore, must
be content on 'this account to observe the
very slow progress which his novel and
.
6 ~
astonishing' mode ~
of interpreting the
Scripture' has' hitherto made among the
learned and thinking classes of Society;
as the humble admirer of his mighty prqject,
I too am prepared to meet with'a similar
reception. When the Christian and philo-
sophical world can be convinced that the
first books of scripture, instead of present-
ing us with a history of real persons and
events, contain only an
allegorical represen-
tation of the 'progress of astronomy,and
the reform of the calendar: that the three
hundred and eighteen" servants of Abraham,
are somany days; thatthe red sea is the
concave hemisphere; and that when thegnen
of Ai,»smote of the Israelites six and thirty
men, and chased them from the Gate
even unto Shebarim, they were in reality
the men of the calendar who smote thirty#
six, amounting to -the dceans, the divisions

the mysteries of Sir William Drum-
mond. -
i
`
i
Sir William has invented a new mode of
eliciting ithat Truth, which is the common
object of all who are not contented Ato
think with the vulgar. Instead of looking
for moral arguments,_ and metaphysical
subtleties, he traces the goddess through
all the living and_ dead languages, till' he
discovers her in the recesses' of words, in
theconsonants of a radical, or in therem-
nant of a zodiac. "'
Truth," says Milton,
"once came into the world, with her di-
vine Master, and was a
perfect shape,
most glorious to look upon: but
when He
ascended, and his apostles after him were
laid asleep, there strait arose a
wicked race
of deceivers, who,_ (as the story goes ofthe
Egyptian Typhon, with his companions,
l0
how they dealt with the god Osyris,) took
the virgin Truth, hewed her lovely form
into a thousand pieces, and scattered them
to the four winds. From that time to the
present, the Sad friends of Truth, such as
durst appear, imitating the careful search
that Isis made, for the mangled body of
Osyris, Wmlf up and down, gathering them
up limb by lamb, mn, as they mia and
them." In this search. lighted by the lamp
of his reason, and enamouned of the 'de-
scription of the charms of t
Truth, Sir Wil-
liam has engaged.
-
He has -wandered after
her through the dark corners of the East:
he has explored the -recesses of idolatry,
and the gloomy caverns of infidelity: he
has acquired the
languages, and -roved
thlfOl1gh~f.h8 desolate wildernesses of distant
nations, t
to recover her' vanished graces;
and to gaze on her forgotten
1 1 ~
After all this labor he has presented us with
the full length portrait of the virgin. Never
has the attention of mankind been directed
to a worthier object. Enrobed in the
emblems of astronomy, and covered with
the figures of the constellations, she appears
to complete the perfectibility .ofi human
nature. Commanding us to desert thealtas
of revelation, to kneel at that of reason
and liberality, she points to ~the Persian
sphere, the Indian zodiac, and the Egyptian
hieroglyphic, as the sacred .substitute ofthe
Christian Scriptures. Such are the ,disco-
veriesofi learning! Such the result of .the
researches of Sir William Drummond!

You will no longer be surprised, gentle-
men, that I should find materials to demon-
strate my theory, when I act on Sir William
Drummond's plans. I search only for
similar arguments to those in the (Edipus
Judaicus, and I may therefore confidently
ask, If one hypothesis be worthy of public
favor, why should not the other? Each has
the same sort of objections to overcome,
and each may be supported onthe same
description of authority. Sir William
Drummond has nothing to contend against,
but facts, and history, and chronology, and
festivals incelebration of facts, the uniform
concurrent testimony of all ages, and na-
tions, and_ the dictates of common sense:
to these he yery effectually opposes etymo-
logy, hypothesis, and fable. When I would
shew that Cmsar is Aries, and Augustus
Taurus, I am sensible the same difficulties
'
1

_.;» v-1.--~§_;... _ _
I
13°
must
oppose themselves; and had I not
such an example of patient courage and
perseverance as that before me, I confess
I should shrink under the attempt. But I
kneel with the ingenious Sir William at the
"f altar of truth and nature, of which the
,basis is established by reason."
' "
'
`
'Facts indeed have neveribeen considered
'of sufficient authority, to enforce convic-
tion -
among. the objectors to Christianity,
how then can they be expected to 'compel
our faith in History. Calculations have been
made to ascertain the period which may
elapse before
A
any authenticated fact
'
will
become incredible. We have more reason
to believe in the battle of Waterloo, than in
that 'of Blenheim; and we have stronger
'
Preface, page vi. p
A
14
reasons for crediting the victory of Blen-
heim, than that at Marathon. In propor-
tion to
the distance of an event, ought
to be our belief in its truth' ; and we may
therefore anticipate the, happy period
when these battles shall be all proved astro-
nomical emblems. The time may come,
when William the Conqueror, as well as
Caleb the brother of Joshua, may be de-
monstrated to be Sirius; and theevidence
may be found by comparing the names of
bis companions, the supposed ancestors of
our noble families, with the names of the
constellations round the dog-star.
The proposition, the truth of which I
am anxious to establish, is nearly the same
as that of ,Sir William Drummond: to
quote his own words,
"
I pretend, that the
antient Jews, like the other nations of anti-
151 »
quity, had
their esoteric, and
theirveiiotetic
doc'trinés.". That as, the hntient Jews
disguised the history of the progress of
astronomy and the reform -of the calendar,
under the veil of simple narration, and
apparent matter of feet, 'and' the mystery
has never been solved till the present day.
The afgutnehts on which this hypothesis is
supported, are derived from etymology,
coincidence, and tradition.
'I pretend that the Rdmah
i
nieeefiaes,
Tacitus, Suetonius, Src., had their esoterie,
arid exoteric'doctril1es: they are enig-
medeel writers, sed eeseeeled certain trliths
from the vulgar under the disguise of a
'most candid, and impdrtial statement df
fuots. These truths, eonsequently, like the
esdizerib doctrines of the Jews, me gene-d
rkllgy 'unknown among their descendants;
`
16 y
like these too, they do not even seem to
have been understood at the time they were
written ; a. circumstance which adds consi-
derably to our merit, in discovering their
meaning at present. My arguments are
likewise deduced from etymology, coinci-
dence, and tradition ; and I trust by their
assistance "
to explain the hidden sense of
many passages," in the Romanhistorians.
The task I have assigned myself; with all
its difficulties, is of much easier execution
than that of my learnedfpredecessor. The
institutions of the Mosaic law, seem in-
tended for the express purpose of utterly
abolishing the difference between -all eso-
teric and exoteric doctrines. Wherever
this' difference existed, superstition; idolatry,
and priestcraft uniformly prevailed. The
laws of Moses, like the laws`of the holy
.
U
17 n
Jesus, were intended for the collective
body of the people. The code which united
them was publicly promulgated: one part
of that. code was, that they should study
their Scriptures; and we well know that
they made transcripts of their laws, and
preserved the
pedigree of their fathers, and
the histories of their ancestors with such
jealous and scrupulous attention, as to pre-
clude the possibility of emblems, or fables
insinuating themselves into the sacred teit.
When the Pentateuch was written, the Jews
had many more convincing reasons .to
believe that Abraham and the twelve
Patriarchs ,were real characters, than we
have to believe that King ohn signed the
Magna Charta. Sir William Drummond's
merit therefore is exceedingly great, that
in spite of such deterring didiculties he has
been able to furnish arguments to support
rdldip.
I
i'

his hypothesis, that these were astrono-'
mica] emblems: but how unlimited must
he his merit, in having lshown Joshua to be
an astronomical emblem, as well as awar-
rior and a
sage! Joshua, we know, enforced
the law of Moses, whom he succeeded :
the division of the land of Canaan -was
completed under the auspices of this chief,
and judge ofIsrael ; and the real existence
of Joshua appears to vulgar apprehensions
to be as much identified with the Holy Land
itself, (unless that too be the Great Bear, or
the Milky Way,) as the real existence of
Alfred is identified with the original division
of England into counties. .Compared with
this 'e&`oi°t, my task is indeed light. The
Romans were by, no
means so careful. of
their-records; and errors, and emblems of
all. kinds could haveinore easily obtained
admission into their' chronicles. The people

They -,paid no reverence to the very letter
of their credited annals; and' from the conf
sequent negligence of all classes, the'astro4
nomical 'types and emblems, which those`
obscure and mystical authors Tacitus,
Suetonius, and others, haveconcealed under
the emasl-r of plain matter otilfact, are not
understood- 'by the descendantsf of the

l shall now submit tofyour approbation
some rules of etymology, derived frornthe
authority of, Sir,William Drummond, and
many others. '
i
`
'
'
From 'the evidence of an innumerable
collection of writers, I may, here assume :as
a
preliminary, 'that the whole earth was
originally of one language: all languages
are derived from onesouree, and-, however
they may now differ, it is probable we shall
find' in each, many radicals, and rvords,
which are to be traced to the original stock.'
Etymology is the -art of. discovering 'these'
words; by stripping oil' their sinecure ap-
pendages of mood, tense, number, person,
gender, digamma, affix, preiix, intensitive,
and _aocent.' Etymology can
change, derive,
add, or subtract syllables. Like a suit of
chain armor, it bends at pleasure over every
part of an
hypothesis; and defends a
new
system, by guarding against' the intrusion
of all the darts and arrows of facts and

history; while. the whole may moves-easily
beneath its
irnpeneltrable strength. ,Its
only disadvantage is, that if the
links are
once broken through, the most- illustrious
theory. which depends on its protection,
becomes at once
utteqly powerless and
defenceless: and is suffocated in ,its _own
discoveries. Like all 'useful-auxiliaries, it
must be subjected to discipline ; and the
few following rules have been considered of
importance., ~
`
» _ .
'
»
All words of more than onesyllable may
be reduced-to a monosyllable`; because all
language, as we
daily see in infan1is,,was~at
iirstmonosyllabic.

,
» _
All beginnings and endings of_
words may

_
three letters, ,or if necessary, only two~let-
ters remain,
'
V
' `
_
Vowels may _be added-or rejected; Con-
sonants only form the ,roots of words.
'
4
When ,the radicals are discovered, the
word of _which they are
composed. maybe
read either backwards,.or forwards, as may
be foundf convenient. ,Thus Cnscha. is the
same as Cacus: Ain-ait, as Ait-ain ; Ees-
ain, as Hanes; with many others, for which
I_refe1t to Mr. Bryant.
'
Should one_ consonant .
only remain,
vowels may be added either.befo're, or.af`ter

justly expect; to 6nd much of thefprimeval'

guage, we must drag the roots of the most'
obstinate words from the iirst oriental
dialect in which they have :taken shelter,
and bring them out tohbe stripped or clothed

the roots of nearly all the oriental diaiectsi
and as the best Hebrew 'scholars have
derived' words in every language of Europe,
and the wor1d,froxn Hebrew, I consider its
authority in all etymological cases as'
decisive. Though I cannot prove it to'
have been the primitive language, I believe
itto contain more of the words originally
spoken hy mankind than any other ; and .If
therefore appeal td itwithout reluctance.
Such '
are the rules ef. that etymology,
which 'in many instances has been
successful fauxilia.ry.`of _Sir William Drumf-
mond, andiiiom the assistance of which It
'
s
95 °
hope` my own system will 'receive is
equal
support. I now proceed to the considera~
tion of my .hypothesis ;~ merely premising,
that inthe very same sense in which Sir
William, to use his own words, understands
"
those parts of the Hebrew Scriptures,
which are usually called historical, to be
partly allegorical and partly historical,"
do I likewise receive and understand the
Roman Historians. The most strange, and
almost unaccountable circumstance is this:
that the very coincidences which identify
the Patriarchs with the 'twelve Signs of the
Zodiac, identify the Caesars with them
also: acircumstance indeed so very surpri-
sing, that if I had time to prosecute the
inquiry,
'
I might prove, that as things
which are equal to the same, are equal to
one another, the Patriarchs are the Caesars,
and the~Caesars the sons of Jacob, because
r
,

they are- both synonymous with the
Zodiac. I fear, however, this "decision
would more
embroii the fray ;" and I shall
not therefore permit it to detain me longer
from entering upon my,diSquisition.

THOU¢H Sir William aDrummond's pro-
fessed object~ is to prove' only that 'the
standardsiof the twelve tribeswere taken
fromthe Zodiacal signs, "he keeps the word
of»
'promiseito the ear, and breaks it to the
faith;" his arguments undoubtedly identify
the Patriarchs themselves, with' these signs.

the Sun, who, after having descended to,

sent him as struggling against the constellag
tions Y; which they typified by an ram butting

A
He was, as it' were, the

Gad was Aries.

Similar arguments prove the identity of
Caesar with Aries. The name Caesar (says
Zuerius .in ~
his notes to Suetonius) is
derived from the Arabic '
Casara, frangereg'
to make war
against, to conquer, to iight,
as the Ram fights with the Constellations.

Caius Julius Caesar was the son of

'
`
We are informed by the late venerable,
andfleamed Jacob Bryant, in his catalogue
°_
~
so
of theradicals of the Ammonian language,
that the words Lux, Luceo,- Luoidus, &c,
are alli derived from Auxag or El Uc, one of
the names of the Sun. Lucius is evidently
derived from Lux, and originally referred
to the Solar Deity, the universal object of.
idolatrous Worship. _
Aureliais derived from A_ur1mLight, and
El, the Sun. The word Aurelia signifies
butterfly, which is well known to be the
emblem, not only of the soulj leaving the
body, pbut of the Sun ,breaking ,from the
dreariness of winter, and _renewing the (life
and beauty offnature in the spring. 'What
then can be the offspring of Luciusi and
Aurelia; or the offspring of the great Sun, at
the period when it emerges from_ the domi-
nion of winter, but Cmsar, the sign Aries? '-

Consider the radicals- of the 'name itself,
and_ all doubt on the question vanishes.
Caius' 'Julius Cmsarg-Xa: Caia, Caias, or
Caius, is the original word for a
cavern, or
house, in the primeval Cuthite, half Hebrew,
half Sanscrit, or Ammonian language.
These radicals do uo_t,~ however, says Mr.
Bryant, (vol. 1. p, 112, 113.)' relate merely
to a cavern, but to temples founded near
such places. Thus Caieta in Italy, Kamfn,
was so derived ; and many other
instances
are collected, for all which I refer' to his
Analysis of Antient Mythology; If have
many 'reasons for supposinggthat, the word
was not' only applied to express--the temples
of the Gods, but the houses, or mansions,
which the signs of the Zodiac occupy in the
Heavens: we read .of the ,mansions of the
moon; and !Eschylus ,calls the sky,-the
temple, or.Caias, of the Sun. ~
W
as
`
Julius, is evidently a
corrupfion of Qjmsg,
the Sun: hoth are derived from the same
'useful radical, Al or El; and according to
the rules of etymology, the vowels which
precede, or follow a common fradical, are
changeable at' pleasure. Q
»
,
'
Caesar is properly written Kdwug, Kaisar;
'that is, Cai a» mansion, and Sar, which is a
term uniformly denoting an _things eminent,
honorable, splendid, or
superior. Thus the
princely people of Tyre and Sidon,»wene
called Sarim (Isa. xxiii, 8.) The name Sarah,
a. Lady or Princess, was
given' to thewifel
of; Abraham. So»we have, Serapis ; Sar-
chon; Sarabetha ; Sardis or Sarades; Sa-
ron, Saronides, and many olshers, (vide
Bryant). The word Snr is here used in
composition, to signify that mansion of
'
l
33
tihe Sun, 'or'tha<t sign in 'the Zodiac which
is the ¥irst, or 'most emfitient.
Tlie whole name Caius Julius Caesar thexi
may be interpreted thus ;- The house, qf the

Simple desefiprion of the 'situation of the

Such is the inference deduoible from the
name of the first Roman Emperor. If the

_ i
C
o
,
'34-
cally does the appellation Caius Julius

'
1' "
Gada troop shall overcome him; but
he shall overcome at *the last." This
passage is quoted as the next argument of
Sir William, to prove that Gad was Aries;
"
Aries (p. 30.) seems to be the symbol of
the Sun, who, after having descended -to,
and 'returned from the _lower hemisphere,

troop therefore that shall -overcome Gad, is
the body of the 'constellations,'and" "he

This and the other passage of Scripture,

prove the identity of Gad with Aries, will
applykvith equal propriety' to the first Cae-
sarf for how exactly and apprcpriately does

Gad had. provided- the first part for
36
himself, because there, in a
portion of the
lawgiver was he seated."
'
From this 'text
Sir William deduces another argument that
Gad was Aries: I shall not however stop
todiscuss this text, as the words seem, even
at- Brat sight, equally applicable to Julius
Cesar. "
The first part," has evidently an
allusion to his place in the Zodiac, typified
by hisseizing the supreme power. "The
portion of the la.wgiver"_ is that part of the
Sun's dominion which the Ram occupied;
and is shadowed out by the Roman histo-
rians under the idea, that Caesar _deprived
the Senate, the great lawgiver of Rome, of
their chief power. Sir William coniirmsrhris
remarks by observing,
"
in' the Persian
sphere, a
young man is herelrepnesented
sitting on a throne." Similar proof is to be
found in the mysterious Suetonius, in
his
'
Deutlsuxiii, 21.
account of the presentation of the diadem
by Antony (§ 7Q.); and we even End
event commemorated in our common school
bhoks, where Caesar is uniformly repreg
serited as seated on a throxie, or curule

Gaul, or Gallia. The word is derived
from '71, the revolving sphere, or heavens,
and Ai, which in the old Ammonian lau-
guage always signified a district; hence it
was added to_ the names of places; hence
too, as Bryant observes, (vol.'i. p. 90.) so
many places are erroneously supposed to
have a
plural termination, as Athenai,
Patrai, Amyclai. Sometimes, as in the
present instance, it is made short, as in
]Ethiopia', Oropia, &c. &c. The word
Gallia therefore, signilies the district where
the Heavens were worshippedf Much op-
position, as is typically related ,
in the
commentaries imputed to Caesar, was made

From Gaul Caesar proceeded to Britain.
Few words have given so much trouble to
Etymologists as that of Britain. I think
the difiiculty has arisen solely from their
ignorance of the universality of Tsabaism.
It may be thus derived. Albion, Ai, the
Ammonian word for land, prefixed, as
Egypt (Ai-gupt); instead of postfixed, as
in all other eases. Hence Ai, 1:15 the land
of the
moon, where they worshipped f the
moon. .. The word 1:5 signifies white, ,from
the silvery appearance of*the moon. Hence
theabsurd, though popular notion of the

Caesar could not make these people
reform their Calendars: their inflexible
obstinacy is commemorated in the story of
his defeat. .
t
This defeat was related, in an alle-
gorical tale of a
spring tide. These tides
are caused by the moon. Hence we may
anive at the real history. Through the
influence of those beach of the people who
Were peculiarly attached to the worship. of

of _Mona, the antient name of Anglesey.
The Germans were accustomed to wander
from one part of their country to another,
to observe with more accuracy the appear-
ances ofthe heavens ;l thus we read of the
Helvetii and others leaving their homes;
`

_
and Ariovistus tells Caesar (de bell. Gall.
b. 1. p. 36) that fourteen years had elapsed
since the Germans had dwelt in roofed
houses ; so
passionately were they attached
to astronomical" studies. Caesar did not
conquer Germany, though he is represented
as having put an end to their incursions,on
the Roman territory; that is, his argu-
mentswere so
powerful, that they could not
resisthim; yet they weretoo proud, and
obstinate to receive his Almanacs. This
is implied by the expression, non

is, they would argue

rived from ur, Ol me light or fire; pro-
nounced As, Es. or Is, with the ~Aspirate;
and the celebrated word An, En, or Ain, the
Ammonian, _or Cuthite radical for a foun-
tain ; (the same as the Hebrew ry.) with-the

the fountain of fire, and describes ,their~
Tsabaism. .

After much civil war, Cwsar is said to
have become _masterof Rome. If this is to
be understood literally, we may likewise
recei-ve in theirrliteral sense,
theaccounts
of Moses and Joshua. Both are equally
matters of fact, or equally allegorical." But
the perfectibility of human nature, I again
mention the. fact with delight, is rapidly
consunimating. nWe are no longer. toybe
imposed upon by such narrativesr, :Rome
itself is allegorical. It is derived from
`
48
'
:nh (the modern Jews must be wrong to
speu the word otherwise) to agime, to 'be
violently moved, to thunder. Caesar con-
quered the city called Rome, by compelling
them among the moat violent agitations
to
reform the Calendar. -This
'
explanation
of the word Rome, will receive additional
confirmation from examining with candor,
and impartiality, the history of Csesar's
army crossing the Rubicon. _
~
The 'passage of the Jordan is 'shewn by
Sir William Drummond to denote the
cutting of the Equator and the opening of
the year; because rn' may signify in He~
brew, as it 'does in Chaldee,

roglyphic for the 7Sun's annual orbit. How
much more is the Rubicon the Sunis path:

From Rome, after he had suiiiciently
instructed the people there, Caesar has-
izenedto Egypt. The circumstances of the
expedition to that plaoe,_are as
certainly
typical, as the narrative of the *capture of
Jericho. I have time-only to mention a
few. »
By his previoué exertions, we may sup-
-pose, that the fame of this-celebrated Re-
_fbrmerof Calendars, and Maker of Alma-
nacs, wee widely extended. The Egyp-
tians froni the earliest antiquity had been

They were distinguished for their know-
ledge, their philosophy, and theirmystei
ries ; yet even this nation; with all its'pre-A

Caesar is said to have been the great rival
of Pompey. ~~Mr. Bryant has beautifully

that Caesar would follow,-and to' avert the
.impending danger, Pompey was, ordered to
be put to death. _
,
'
The name
Pompey is compounded of the
"Egyptian prefix P ; Om, the ancient word
for the Sun, the same as Ham; and "Phi,
an oracle. The oracle, says Bryant, was
termed Omphi; it was
expressed P'Qmphi,
or
P'Ompi; whence the 1I°,u.1r-4 of the
-G-reeks, and the word' 1Iap.»-umg, the saine
asgPompei`us, .which .always related to
divine inHuence.' The fame of Caesar was
-well known to Egypt, When it was cer»
tainly understood that he wascoming, the
king and his ministers met, to deliberate
on the reception they 'should give him.
*They considered the claims of their God,
ands the freal merits., of _the
'
Tsabaistical
smiperstition.. ]Pompey,. the former ,zobject
,
of their worship, is emblematically, and
pathetically described, as
pleading for' his
life. But the voice of truth prevailed; the
worship of the Sun ceased ; his oracles, the
P'Omphi, or
P'Ompi, or
Pompey, which
they had venerated, 'were silenced;
i
and
Cwsar was welcomed to Egypt, though not
without some
opposition of the Tsabaists,
which he soon overcame. -
The above explanation of this obscure
portion- of history, is authenticated by a.
just apprehension of his addresses to Cleo-
patra, the meaning of which word, we
must now take into consideration.
This supposed Queen of Egypt Wi!! BD

in the same manner as lux, from 110109, Ol'
EL, Uc, the great sun (vide Bryant-)
.53
As the E, is omitted in this instance in the
first syllable ; ~so is the U, omitted in the
name Cleopatra. The word is completely
Ammonian, from UC, 'T5¢, up with EL
the Sun ; and the celebrated word Petra,
Patera, or Petora, an
Ammon-ian title of
honor, 'which did not attribute divinity to
the Sun, but only Br certain degree of supe-
rior veneration and respect. Much curious
information on this
subject may be col-
lected from Bryant, vol. i. 283, &c.

`
The clear definition of this word Cleopa.
tra, was absolutely essential to the elucida-
tion of this mysterious narrative. Caesar
was an admirable _
politician. The king
and his ministers had consented to destroy
the Pomphiworship; and Caesar affected to
regret the abrupt manner in which it had
been done. In return for their ready com-
,
p
54
pliance with his' projected innovation, 'he
carried this affectation to a still greater
extent. . He professed his esteem and
regard to so much of their former notions,
as he supposed he could overrule to more
useful purposes. This is alluded to in the
avowal of his attachment to Cleopatra,
which is evidently an acknowledgment, that
he considered the Sun, though no longer
P'0mpi, an object of worship, yet still to be
Patora, or Patra, entitled to their veneral
tion; as the controller of the seasons,
the dispenser of blessings, and the best
visible representation of its maker. He
succeeded so
completely in this ingeni-
ous Enesse, that he established his new
calendar without more dilficulty. 'He is
said to have had a Son by Cleopatra: the
meaning of which is, that he continued
the _Patorahf homage to the

Pontus was conquered' by Caesar., The
'word Pbntus is a
compound' of the _pljeiixa
P, and the celebrated On, or 9, and W. Its
king was Pharnaces ;,_that is, ,the Rulerof
the light ; an epithet of the same .pompous
and magnificentdescription usually, assumed
by oriental monarchs. The word Pharnacés
is derived from B, and 'nm with the common
addition of Anac, the most ancient title
given; to sovereigns. t
Pontus. was a-seat of
the Tsabaistical superstition ; and the fame
`
56 .
of Caesar, his knowledge, and eloquence,
persuaded the king at the first conference,
top _adopt the Roman Almanac. Caesar
expended 'very little time in the promulga-
tion and establishment of his new calendar;
and it is to this rapiditgr ofhis astronomical
success that he refers in those welkknown;
and emphatic words-veni, vidi, vici.

In the same manner I could prove every
supposed conquest of this illustrious

to the 'alteration in

Julius Caesar is reported to have worn

Joshua subdued ~five kings of the~Arno-
rites: Sir William Drummond shews that

many authorities to confirm this assertion.
They have repaid the obligation by enabling
him to prove that the Amorites who dwelt
in Hazezou Tamar, were not Lambs, or
teachers, but upper branches. Brutus
and Cassius were said to be the murderers
of Caesar; It is a very remarkable fact,
that even now,when we talk of this suppes-t
ed assassination, we say, Brutus, and Cas-
sius ; never Cassius, and Brutus; a custom,
not merely arbitrary, but one corrupted from
the traditionary words which were originally
used] to describe this event. Brutus is
derived from mn
a_ cypress tree, whence
the Latin' word .Brutus a
cypress; and
Cassius from wp to collect, or assemble one
by one., It_ seems at first sight a most
singular phrase to say, the cypresses ass
semble one by one; but the real significa-
tion is, that the sign of the Ram becomes

Y

invisible only, when the other stars have
gradually 'appeared above the horizoni
they seem to assemble one by one. The
word ma, which was
corrupted into Brutus,
was always used as the nominative, and
though the formuof the expression was re-
tained, its meaning`was -lost ; till it was my
good fortune to recover it. A
' '
`
Among other phrases which have been
adopted by Suetonius to conceal his-real
meaning, the expression used by 'Cmsar to
Brutus when struck, in the Senate house,
'is 'among the most enigmatical. The
'well-known words- used at the f Elen-
sinian mysteries, konx,'om, panx, were
understood by none 'till' Captain Wilford
shewed it was
pure Sanscrit; so the expres-
.sion in question, was handed down
`-by
tradition- Suetonius: ,and has been since
.-
/ .
`
_
so
received in an acceptation totally distinct
from its original signification : and it is wor-
thy of remark, that Suetonius speaks with
more than his usual caution, when he relates
the supposed assassination. It is to be
found in the 82nd section-quidam tradi-
derunt, Marco Bruto irruente dixisse, xai
vb ¢Z Exdvwv, nal fb rixvov. From which
originated the Apocryphal story of, Et`tu
Brute. How strangely have the world
been deceived! This expression, though so
long considered a
simple Greek sentence,
is pure Hebrew, and contains an indirect
allusion to the change of the Sun's place
from Aries, to Pisces, at the commence-
ment of the year. It may be thus read:

II. Augustus-Joseph-Taurus.
-40-3-Cir ,
- Wu EN I commenced the attempt to shew
me identity of the scams, with thezsdi.
acal signs, I was
apprehensive there would
be sometimes a deficiency of proof. I am
now only anxious to compress within the
shortest possible compass, the accumu-
lated materials which press upon me. I
have said suiiicient to explain the system of
interpretation, by means of which the real
sense of History may be discovered. Ex
pede Herculem, shall now be my motto,
and I will endeavor to be brief in the
subsequent detail.
A
.
Joseph is proved to be Taurus from the
description given of him in the 22d verse
465g
of.Gen._ 49, as- newly translated by Sir
William.Drummond. The passage which in
our translation is read,~
"
Josephf is' a
fruitful.bough,, even a fruitful. bough by a
well, whose branches run over awa-ll," &c.
&c., ,
to the. end° of verse.26 ;` Sir William
translates-" A;Son of a.Cow, is
Joseph-;
a`Son of a' Cow beside Ain. The Benoth
walk upon the ~Bull,' the .Archers have
sorely grieved him,"
'
&c. &c., and from the
wordsthusl translated, Joseph is proved 'to
be'Taurus.= .
'
From a similar form of expression, war-
ranted by the Roman
'
historians; I 'shall
identify Augustus with the same
sign.
A.Son .of. a cow is Joseph, a Son of a
cow beside Ain.

Roman custom. Hence Oc-tau, or Oc-
tav, or Qctavius the great Bull.
`
More decisive confirmation of the§fact is
to be found in the' name -of his reputed
mother. Augustus 'was the Son ,of Accia,
or Acca ; the aspirate has been strangely
omitted; the proper reading is Vacca, a
Cow; a Son of a Cow, is Augustus. .

'Further evidence
`
of the identity of
Augustus, with Taurus, may be derived
from the epithet Thurinus, which was
given
to him in his infancy; Suetonius" furnishes
us with several reasons why this title was
assigned to Augustus. The real cause is to
be found only in accuratelyiunderstanding
the word itself. It is evidently derived
from the Chaldee, or from the old Ammo-
nian, -the root of the Chaldee 1mn,Thurin,
Oxon, _or Beeves; fThur, says Parkhurst,
quoting from Brooke's Natural History, 'is
still the Lithuanian name for the Urns, or
wild Bull._ _

Augustus therefore, .
like Joseph, wasthe
sign Taurus; because lie was the Son of
Octaavius, and Acciiir and- was called Thu-
rinusi he was the"Soh ofthe Bull, andthe
Cow, :and wamhimselficalled an Ox; all _of

sign Taurus.

"
Beside 'Ain." ~Sir William Drum-
mond understands by these words, the
great star Aldebaran; I am of the same
opinion: but among the Roman historians,
this star was called Antony.
_We know that Aldebaran is in .the head
of the Bull. It is called by the Arabians
Ain-al-tor; or more properly, Ain-tor, Al
being but an article, as Al-koran, Al-
manac, &c. By some error, which cannot
now be discovered, the R was chaniged into
N: and the word therefore was read Ain
or "An-ton, instead of Autor, the termina-
tion in both cases being of no
consequence.
Ainton, or Anton, signifies the fountain of
light, and is ap very appropriate name for
,
59,
this star. When. Augustus was said' to~ have
first prosecuted hisclaims, he was assisted
by Antony ; that is, before-the whole body
of the constellation' became visible, it was
chiefiy distinguished: by the star Aldebaran,
or An-ton. When Augustus' power was
better established, 'he is said to have con-
quered Antony, or An-ton, that is, when
the whole body of
`
the constellation ap-
peared altogether above the horizon, it was
more worthy ofadmi`ration,than when it was
noticed 'only for_one beautiful star. I will
not however speak decidedly ; because, as
_Sir William Drummond observes,
"
the
most ungenerous advantage ~
will
be taken
of my blunders." '
Again,
"
The Benoth walk on the Bull."
As the (Edipus Judaicus recommends to
our observation the simplicity of Scripture,
`
70
so would I direct the attention of my reader
to the same excellence in the Roman his-
torians. If I can but prevail upon him to
set aside their apparent matters 'of fact,
and ascertain tlfeirnreal meaning, ihe will
be astonished at the
discoveries prepared
for him.. We know that the Pleiades,
which are called the Succoth Benoth, are
em the back of the Bull. If August-us is the
Bull, we shall ofcourse expect to End some
mention in the Historians of the Pleiades.
If we search for any account of the Suc-
coth Benoth, in the history of Augustus
in plain terms, we shall be disappointed ;
it is related only in the most beautiful, fand
original strain of metaphor I ever remenii-
ber to have read. .
When Augustussecured his_ power, he is
said to have published a decree for the en-
'
»
,
71,
,
couragement of marriage, with a view to
restorethe losses of the civil war. Now the
word nu: Benoth is derived from mn to
proereate children; and
V'
rnao Succoth is
derived from 'na to overspread, to cover, to
protect, or defend, as laws _defend or
protect, or as a
pavilion overspreads the
people within it. That is, the laws which
were made to` protect the marriages to
supply the state with children, and which
were supposed to be published by Augustus
when in his full power, are in reality the
Pleiades, or Succoth Benoth, on the back
of the Bull. -

Other proofs might be adduced, but it is

III. iTiberius-Benjamin-Gemini.
i
BENJAMIN is described ravening as a
wolf: if this alone would prove 'him to be
the sign Gemini, we might apply, even with
more propriety, this argument to identify
Tiberius with the same sign. _
The word Tiberius is derived either from
:nf a wolf, or 'iJD» °H»¢¢Ms', the higher, or
elevated part of the land, or the Zodiac;
(vide the meaning of opoamg, Bryant's-
Analysis, Faber's Origin of Pagan Idolatry;
&c. &c. &c.) or from mn excellence; either
of which will prove him' to have been the
sign Gemini.

He was
evidently a wolf to the Roman
people. He might be called um, from his
unexpected elevation to the supreme power;
that is, the Twins appear to have attained
their greatest height in the summer solstice.
He might be called NWI from the splendor
of his station; the word appears to me to
allude to the beauty, and splendor of the
summer months. I incline to the first deri-
vation, though it is not the most accurate;
Suetonius represents Tiberius ravening as
a wolf, in a iinestrain of allegory.
'
I -was fearful of meeting with some dim-
culty' in proving that one individual could-
be considered as a double -constellation.
This objection is removed by the recollec-
tion, that Tiberius 'is said to have reigned
some years with Augustus, on which ac-
count they were
partly united inthe imagi-
nations of the astronomers.

IV. Crvligula-Isaaehar-Cancer.
l
'
iilli
CALIGULA is Cancer. The common
people, who had lost the original meaning
of we were Caligula, 'imagined' em in
meant a little boot, and invented the ab-
surd story related by Tacitus and Suebonius,
of an infant wearing a small military sandal
to please the soldiers, who named him on
the occasion "Caligu}a. This Apocryphai
tradition is the offspring ofa later age; the
original signification however 'is evident.
`
Among the embleinsin the Astrological
Calendar of the Egyptians, which describe
the sign Cancer is puer sedens; Caligula,
,
76
when shewn to the soldiers, was said to be
sitting in his Nurse's arms. Connect this
coincidence with the original meaning of
Caliga, and Caligula, in the primitive lan-'
guage. 'Cala, Calah, Calach, Cali, and
Cal, in composition signify eminent, or
most lofty: and Ca, or Ga, or Gau, it may
be either, means a house, or mansion,
(vide Bryant.) Caliga therefore is Calah-
Gan, the most lofty mansion. We should
but lose time in attempting to prove how
accurately this epithet describes the situ-
ation of Cancer, the 'highest mansion of the
Sun, in the summer months, By some
strange omission" the name of the AL or
EL, the Sun, was omitted inthe' word
Caliga, and the veneration of the idolatrous
Tsabaists' inserted it at a subsequent pe-
riod; hence' the compound' Cali-Ga-

AL, or EI), or
Galigula, the most lofty
niansion of the Sun.
He was said to be the son of
Gerrnanicns.
I have already shewn the meaning oi' the
wvord iéermany, and Germanicus is evi-
dently derived fromthe same
root,' Meni
the Heavens, and Ger, or WJ to contem~
plate, to be attached to. Germanicus, as
Tacitusso beautifully relates, was
the idol
of the soldiers; that is, they were attached,
to the worship of the,Heavens, the parent
of the constellations in general,--but par-
ticularly of Cancer, the most elevated in
the Northern_hemisphere._

"Time Greeks (p. 22. (Ed.Jud.) placed two
Asses in the _sign of Cancer, and near them
we find the asterisui called Pra-:sepe,_or the
manger. It will be observed that the He-

.78
brew words Ummm rn pw should not be
translated, couching down between two
burthens; but 'two partitions," such as
separate the stalls in a stable." .
_
This is the very translation /most satis-
factory to the reader who wishes for an ad-
ditional proof that Caligula was Cancer.
The several asterisms of the constellations
are typically described under the disguise
of matter-oflfact histories. The asterism
of the Ass is represented, in the Egyptian
Calendar, under the- form of a horse. -Thus

and activity, which are alike descriptive of
the state of labor induced by summer, with
theconsequent necessity of
i
repose after that
labor, and of the union of indolence and
activity typically related in the life of the
allegorical Caligula. But if we can" identify
one star, or one asterismi of a. constellation,
with any asserted fact fin the life of the
supposed real personage vie discuss, ~
we
obtain at once an explanation of every
diliiculty. Substituting therefore a horse
for an ass, in the sign Cancer; and trans-
lating the phrase in question,
"
coaching be-
tween two partitions," as Sir William Drum#-
mond translates it; 'keeping in view at the
'same time the station- of the 'horse in the
heavens, that it is in the highest part of the_
highest sign, we arrive at the true meaning
of
the_Apocryphal story, respecting Cali~
gula and his horse. _

Cancer. The two partitions are the marble

repose in summer,-while thehorse itselfis ty-
pical of the labor. Such are the triumphs of
Coincidence and Etymology, over received
opinions, and the records of history. I add

V. Claudius-Judah-Leo.
°-U33-lv
Q
`
CLAUDIUS is Leo. Tacitus and Sueto-
nius seem to have exerted themselves to
disguise this part of their theory beneath a
double veil of allegory. Yet I cannot but
think I have discovered the long-con-
cealed truth, which I shall therefore sub-
mit to the world, whatever be the oppo-
sition and clamor of illiberal and bigoted
men. ~
In the first book of his annals, Tacitus
informs us that the History of Claudius has
been falsified. Tiberii, Caiique, et CLAUD1 I,

falsas; postquanil occiderant, recentibus
odiis compositae sunt. (sect. 1.) With these
reasons we have nothing to dot they are
very ingenious, and completely answer the
historian's design ; but our
object is to
'
4
penetrate through this artful disguise. The
History of Claudius has been, falsified and
corrupted, and the knowledge of this cir-
cumstance enables us to unravel the whole
mystery; ,
Falsehood is the contrast of truth.
Claudius is represented by tradition as the
iveryvopposite of a Lion: as weak, tame,
spiritless, nerveless, and inactive: in short,
as much unlike a Lion in every respect as
possible. But the accounts-we have
received are false, it evidently follows that
he wasnot weak, and tame, and spiritless;
and if he was not these, then he must
,
_ 84' ~
haverbeen spirited, energetic, and active,
as his emblem the Lion isuniformly repre-
sented : and on strict examination wg shall
find this argument. most singularly con-
firmed.
' `
U
` `
.
Hisxname is derived from rbp. to shine, `to
move
lightly, to be light, ,whence the. word
"n'>p, the origin of» Claudius. The Sunnis
said by tradition to have been at its _utmost
height when Leo occupied the place, which
is now filled by Cancer; but I shall not
insist upon this, though Sir William assures
us the , Sun »
was; at 'that `time 'held in _the
highest honor, and this honor is referred to
by the expressions "thou art he whom
thy brethren shall praise ;"
"
thy hand _shall
be'on the neck of all thine enemies." Our
proofs that Claudius was Leo are much
more decisive.

"The progresstof the Sun through Leo,"

he stooped down, he couched as a Lion,

'
'The 'chief characteristic ofa Lion is, that
it watches for its prey, it couches down, as
if to aim with greater certainty at its object,
anditorseize it more surely. It is slow and
cautious before it acts, and it then acts with
resistless effect and terror. Such was the
'conduct of Claudius. He is said..-to have
been hesitating, and slow,"before he decided ;
in;other words, he -was cautious' as-a couchf
ing Lion; but after his decision his vengeance
was
prompt and effectual. I refer to his
supposed conduct to ,Messalina, of _whom
Juvenal, Tacitus, and' others, say very
/
,
86
scandalous things : to his reputed cruelties
to criminals, to his _conquest of Britain,
which, though he was long in resolving to
attempt, he accomplished with perseverance
and courage. All these imaginary circum#
stances are typical of his lion-like character,
and identify him with the sign Leo. He is
said to have been slow in accepting the
empire; that is, the Sun appears whén in
Leo to begin to move slowly ; the cha'racter
given of Claudius by Suetonius,
"
Mira
anima varietate fuit: modo circumspectus,
et sagax: modo inconsultus, et przeceps;
nonnunquam frivolus, arnentique similis,"
is exactly applicable to a Lion alternately
hungry, and satisfied ; and if I had but time
I would proceed through all the allegorical
actions of his supposed life, and tear away
the matter-of-fact disguise, under which
they have been so long imprisoned.

I shall make no observations on the
remainder of Sir William Drummond's
interpretation of Jacob's blessing on his
supposed son the Patriarch Judah; I
must candidly confess I 'have some old
prejudices left on the subject ofthe predict»
ed Shiloh; and I _dare not venture to
treat this part of my creed with even the
appearance of levity. The evidence addu-
ced by my' teacher does not satisfy me, and
I know he will forgive my scruples. To
me indeed, this part of his hypothesis seems
to be completely identified with the system
of Volney; though I must in this, believe
that I am mistaken, since those admirers
of courteous language, and scholar-like
liberality, who have undertaken' to defend
Sir William Drummond from the censures
of Mr. D'Oyley and others, have asserted
that the theories of these great masters

virtues, that of self-denial: for if they really
love candor, mildness, propriety of 'laué
guage, and the noble feelipgs of gentlemanly
controversialists, so
rigidly have they prac-
tised this virtue, that not a trace.of these
exoellencies is discoverable from the begin-
ning to the end of their pages.

Sm WILLIAM proves Naphthali to
be the
sign Virgo by a curious syllogism. A tree
was represented by the Egyptians beside
the ,sign Virgo. The words "
Naphthali is a
hind let loose, he giveth goodly .words,"_ our
author conceivesfto be wrongly translated;
'aridagrees with 'Bochart in rendering the
passage, Naphthali is a tree shooting forth,
producing goodly branches :' from whence
'
I
purposely omit all other translations, explanations,
commentaries, &.c. 8Le. of all
writers from Lightfoot to

of the manner in which the apparent predictions of Joseph
were fulfilled, has been much admired.

he argues that Virgo is a tree, and Naph-
thali is a tree, therefore valet consequentia.
/
It is a-
peculiar excellence of Sir William
Drummond's system, that not only dis-
covers new interpretations, but it makes
thoseinterpretations of general /and useful
application. In the passage before us how-
ever,`my hypothesis is equally confirmed
by the old and new translation. We are
informed, that Nero, in the _beginning of
his reign ,gave many fair promises 'of future
excellence. Like a tree which produces
goodly branches, he gave expectations of
fruit in its season : like a fair and beautiful
hind, he excited admiration/ by the youth
and beauty of, his person ; he gave goodly
words to
the soldiers and to the people,
he wished to deserve, rather than to receive
the praises of the Senate, and regretted his
r
.
Q1
ability of signing his name to a list of
malefactors.
The mysterious and enigmatical _writers
who have related these circumstances of
Nero, proceed in the most strange and in-»
consistent manner to relate a
pretended
change of conduct. He is said to have be-
come debauched and profligate; eifemi-
nate, cruel, infamous, and lascivious, inv
curring the public hatred: the murderer of
his mother, his tutor, and his friends ; and
at length dying miserably in the gardens of
Phaon. The whole of these Apocryphal
stories are a collection of emblems, referring
to astronomy, and identifying Nero with
the sign Virgo.
l
Virgo once iilled in the Zodiac the place
which is.
nowy occupied by Libra», It was
`
thereforegthe first of the descending signs.
The ancients, as the arch Volney
'
has
demonstrated, considered the six last signs
as the reign of Ahriman, winter, and desola-
tion: and were accustomed to express their
dread of the approaching dreariness, by
every appellation of contempt and detesta-
tion. The change of seasons is impercepti-
ble ; and the hopes in which they indulged,
that the Sun, though he had begun to
descend, would still continue his auspicious
influences, prompted themto consider the
commencement of his decline with com»
placency. Hence they represented in their
histories the sign Virgo, as giving fair pro-
mises, which were never fulfilled ; as a tree
full of branches, but without fruit E as hold-
ing ears of corn in her hand to signify that
the. joy of: harvest was past, though the
'
Vide Volney's Ruins of Empires.
I
»
93
harvestweather was not entirely gone by.
When all these .fair promises were .dis-
appointed, when storms and rain, and the
melancholy changes of the season actually
approached; /they spoke of this sign in the
most
contemptuous language, as the
murderess of a mother, and the enemy of
mankind. The mysterious allusions of this
part of the Roman history are thus fully
developed. As the sign Virgo began with
fine weather, and ended with storms, so
Nero is typically described as commenc-
ing his career in virtuefand closing it in
vice.
'
I could confirm this interpretation by
proving that Agrippina, Britannicus, Se-
neca, Lucan, and others, were Ammonian
names, descriptive of the stars and con-
stellations near Virgo: but I must proceed.
_
,
I forgot to observe, that Nero is defived
from the old word .13 to divide; the Zodiac
in the time of Nero being divided by
Virgo.

VII. Galba-Asher-Libra.
I _
.
_
'
THB name Galba signifies in a second-
ary sense, the balance. It is derived from
352, a shaver, one* who makes smooth, or
permits no
inequalitiy. Galba was so much
esteemed for his lore of justice, and weigh-
ing all things with impartiality as in a
balance, 'that according to
the! Roman
historians, this virtue is said to have been
the chief cause of his elevation to the
empire. ~
I
"
In the account of the Indian sphere,"
says`Sir William Drummond, "under the
sign Libra, I read as follows,

which
our author applies to Asher. It seems much
more plainly to describe the cond uct related
of Galbag' that he was exninent 'for his jus-
tice before his elevation to the empire; and
that .he afterwards 'submitted to be go;
verned by favorites, who bought and sold

peror, and as .an adder biting the horse's
_heelsQ Through his means Galba was
murdered, or

This similarity between the traditions is
but a small part of the proof, which enables
us to identify the Roman Emperor with
the signs Scorpio. The'great starr in the Cor-
(Edzp.
Scorpii, is called Antares, and is used
synonymously with the sign itself: this
assertion may excite some
surprise in my
reader;' but `I hope to make it plainly
appear, that Antares, Dan, and Otho, are
0|¢BDd the same word.; 'they appmr to
be diffemnt on account of the varietly in
the manner-of -pronouncing them; but they

'
.
Scorpio, as Sir William has mhewn, was
esteemed anaccursed sign, and the ancient
»
99h -
astronomers were consequently very un-A
willing to pronounce the name. It was
thought a bad omen to
do. so. It was usual
among the Jews to avoid all mention of'
the sacred tetragrammaton, in their exces-
sive veneration for the God of their fathers.
The Hindoos are still taught to meditate
upon _the mystic ,word Om or Aum; and
even in our own time, we have seen any
English gentleman of great attaingnents,
respectable family, and of the highest pre-
tensions, decline to mention thegnameiofi
Napoleon Buonaparte; choosing rather to
meditate on the perfections associated with
that name, and pointing out the object of
his admiration by the significant word Him.
From these instances we learn, that ~it was
not unusual to avoid a
particular word
altogether, and to
express
it' by another of
similar import.
-
The sign Scorpio was
'

known by the Chaldee particle Da, this, or

the Chaldee pafticlebeing prefixed, 'served to
point out Scorpio, which their superstition
wouldnnot allow them to mention by 'any
other name, than "
the fountain,"
"
the
star." It was a variation only of the original
phrase, and the An may be rejected, while
the meaning of the word is unaltered.
Antares. Arez was a name of the Sun,
(Bryant ;) and An, as we have seen, means
a fountain,or a star. y
"
The Star ofthe Sun"
is the signiiication ; referring to the most
accursed star or sign passed by the Sun in
his ,course through the Zodiac. The word
is unchanged if you take away either the
prefix An, the afHx Arez, or both; and
the letter T, changed from the Chaldee D,
remains. _
Thus are Antares, Dan, and Otho, con}

I CANNOT but regret,.that Sir William
Drummond has placed so much- depend-
ence on Kircher, who is referred to as an*
authority in almost every page; This author
was a most fanciful writer; voluminous,
incorrect, and led astray by a vivid ~imagi4
nation. I. refer to Evclyn's`Memoirs, vol.
Ist, to the biographical dictionaries; and
the list of his works, for further information.
Among other sublime productions, he -wrote
the.Mundus Subterraneus; and he has
been even
suspected of tbrging, or
inventing
facts and circumstances, to complete. an
hypothesis, or continue a narration, when-
ever his materials were deficient.
106
That Zabulon was Capricorn, _is proved
from the opinion of Kircher, and the two
expressions, 'f a
havenfor ships," and "
his
border shall be unto Zidou." (Tsidon.)
The proof from Kircher, Sir William
Drummond himself being judge, I am sorry
to observe,
'
did not appear to me decisive.
"The standard ofZabulon, accordingto Kir~
cher, ought to have represented the sign _of
Capricorn., M.
Dupuis has adopted the same
notion; but his mam _for admitting it is
certainly of no great Weight I must suppose,
that Kircherhad found some tradition nd the
subject; for after a tedious examination, I
am- inclined to agree with him, though he
has not given the slightest intimation, why
he; has referred this sign to Zabulon." -_

I This amiable reluctance to forsakea tried
friend, is much to be admired; ibut, I, fear
the bigoted readen will sugest, ,that if
_there is no evidence. whatever, noteven- the
slightest intimation of proof, in this case,
it is possible that Sir William's whole theory
may be erroneous. This .inferenceis too ,dis-
agreeableto be admitted. If the theory is
unfounded, what becomes of-the learning,
the etymology, the_ coincidences, and. all
the well-armed supposes, and takings for
granted, which have been so beautifully
embodied against the universally received
interpretation of Scripture History f? But
it is extravagantto imagine that Sir William
Drummond, who is so eminent for extensive
learning, acute penetration, and refined
-ingenuity, could have wanted sufficient
sagacity to have anticipated an
objection
so obvious. And would it not be still
,._¢n_
dw
more extravagant to imagine, that he would
expose, by an,
injudicious silence, the in-
valuable results of his patient industry, and
extensive research, to the risk of being
overthrown' by a remark, which he must of_
necessity have foreseen; unless he was con-
vinced that it was too insignificant to
demand a serious refutation? Kircher too.
has written four folio volumes on the sub-
ject of Egyptian Antiquities, consequently
his assertions must be arguments. He pro-
bably omitted his reasons on the present
occasion, on some account not
now dis-
coverable; it would be very illiberal to
suppose he had therefore no reasons.
The second proof of identity betweenthe
patriarch and the constellation, is- the
expression
"
he shall be a haven for ships :"
this ought bo be read "
a
haven for a
ship."
.
,
109
((Ed. Jud. p. 20.) The ship is Argo,
which descends under the horizon when
the Sun is in.Capricorn. Hyginus explains
the matter better: "
Capricornus exoriens
hmc sidera ad terram 'premere videtur;
reliquam Iiguram navis et_signum," &c.
Tins seems to indicate why Zebulon is
called a haven for aiship.
The only event in the life of the reputed
Vespasian, which appears allegorically to
describe this circumstance, is recorded /by
the mystical Tacitus. (Hist. lib. 3. § 12.)
As Capricorn is in the side of the Heavens,
opposite tothe ship Argo, ,of which it is
very enigmatically said _to be the haven;
so was
Vespasian at a distance from Ra-
venna, wheu the fleet chose him for their
commander. The analogy seems in both
cases to be equally convincing. _

",
His border shall be unto Zidon."
"
The
countriesof Zebulon
and the Zidonians, as
it has been fi-equentlye observed, do not
border upon each other. The allusion
therefore, seems to be astronomical, 'rather
than geographical. TW may be translated
the great hunter: Arcitenens probably, of
Sagittarius, who occupies the sign next to
that of Capricorn." (Ed. Jud. p. 21.
Vespasian, as we read in the Roman
Historians, was the conqueror of the Holy
Land, and extended his dominion even un-
to Sidon.

This fact is evidently typical of
the approximation of Vespasian 'or Capri¢
corn, to Sagittarius, or TM, and identifies
the supposed emperor with the former

brew. Nothing was more usual than' to

instance. mn signifies pure, brightas the
solar flame, whence 'HJ the pure xther, the
'clear bright matter of the heavens. As Jo-
sephus, and_ others, had no knowledge of the
.original story, they reported-that Titus, _,or
Aquarius, was the lover of mn; and he .was

The star Bulha, or Bilhah, which is in
Aquarius, rises while the Sun is yet in
Capricorn, the domicile of Saturn, the star
of Israel; and it sets when Aquarius sets,
'which accordingto Sir William Drummond,
exnlains that passage of Scri`pture which
asserts that Reuben went up to his fathers
bed. The same circurnstance, though not

so plainly related, seems to be intimated in
the mysterious pages of Tacitus. .
J
Berenice, or Beronice, was the mistress
of Titus, But when Vespasian had been
saluted emperor by his troops, and his
friends began to assemble their forces in his
cause, (by whiclvtypical circumstances I
understand .the gradual increase of the Sun's
power when in the sign Capricorn) _Berog
nice, then beautif'ul,,and young, united her
assistance, and was metaphorically said to
be very acceptable to the aged emperor.
"
Nec rninore animo, (says Tacitus," Hist.
lib. 2.§ 81.) reginaBerenice partes juvabat,
amen; aatate formdque, et seni quoque
Vespasiano magnificentia munerum grataf'
If these words referred to real life, we
not avoid suspecting Beronice of too much
fondness for power, or its possessor; but
_
118
we should be unjust to indulge the suspi-
cion. If however we consider the words as
allegorical, we immediately see the pro-
priety and simplicity of the historian's
language. Berenice was attached to Ves-
pasian, as a star to its constellation.
'
Now Titus, though anadmirable and
excellent general, legislator, and em-
peror, is reported to have been very proili-
gate, when under the influence of his re-
puted father. Combining all the circum-
stances we have thus enumerated, I cannot
but believe that I have ascertained the
astronomical emblem concealed under this
obscure history. We End that Berenice is
Bilhah, the Concubine of Vespasian, the
paramour of Titus. Titus is the sign Aqua-
rius, his mistress is. the star Bulha,-+the
asterism of Capricorn, his supposed father.

into the accursed Scorpio_; _for Pisces must
descend before the latter rises." (Ed. Jud.

"
that the word

shackle, which the Greek astronomers
called sometimes Mvov, and- sometimes
a-Men-p.¢>;," p. 10. I am
atall times happy
to express my admiration of my 'learned
124|
guide, and my deference to his opinions;
hilt I am particdlarly happyion the present
occasion, as I think it
will enable me to do
so with peculiar effectand advantage. Sir
~William informs us,' as I have before
noticed,
"
that heis
inclined to agree with
Kircher, though he has not given the
slightest intimation of a reason, for what
asserts." I am delighted to have this
aopportlhnity of following his example ; and
I therefore confess, in all' humility, that I
really agree with, Sir William Drummond,
'that the word »
'ID' 'does not signify a secret,
but ahond, or shackle; while I candidly
acknowledge I'have not the shadow of a
reason for so
doing. y
"
Unto their assembly, mine honor, Tbc 'not

thou united."
These words have been gene~
rally' supposed to refer to the imagined
slaughter of the Shechemites. Sir William
Drummond, however, translates them,
"-Let, not the light of my star united to
their constellation." He adds, (pagt-310) "it
appears fiom the Astrological Calendar, that
the emblems accompanying the sign Pisces,
were chieiiy indicative' of death, and vio-
lence. How incomparably then have the
Roman historians described this sign, in the
cruel and vengeful life of the last Caesar!
The murder of the_ Christians, for instance,
by Domitian, is as allegorical, as that of
the Shechemites by Simeon and Levi !"
"
For in their anger they slew a' man.'f
That is, according to Sir William Drumf-
mond,
"
Jacobseems to attribute all the
effects produced by thetrising of Scorpius,

to/ the descent _of Pisces. The death of
Orion wasattributed to the sting of the
Scorpion ;" and
this we find is the man here
alluded to. Domitjan slew many men; and
if_ each death is typical of the setting of
Orion; it clearly proves, that the Roman
historians disguised oneastronomical truth
under a
great variety of original and
'
simi-
lar emblems. A
s" In their se%will they digged down a
wall." Sir William Drummond's translation
ofthis 'passage is indeed peculiar to himself:
to use his own words, f' This interpretation,
I conceive 'to be erroneous. I translate-
in their seMwill they castrated a bull." (Ed.
§Iud."p. 12. The death of this bull is the
principal event in the allegorical 'life of
Domitian. Bulls were
used in agriculture,
as well as in astronomy, and were called cul-
tivalors of
the ground, and I have no

doubt that'Agricola, who is 'said' to have
been killed by Domitian, was in fact this
very Bull,` and that he received his fname
fiom' his employment ;' Agricola signifying
a cultivator of the ground.
-
`
Tacitus apparently found great diiiiculty
in describing this singular emblem, vrith
that delicacy he so studiously affected. -He
chose therefore to represent' it under the
fictitious history of Agricola's death by poi-
son-he evidently appears to labor under
extreme perplexity, but has 'successfully
overcome every obstacle, by veiling this
emblemin most sublime obscurity.
"
Au-
gebat miserationem constans rumor, ireneno

undoubtedly brought iutoaction all his

doctrine tlirougliout the whole of this gg
oteric life of Agricola., His, ingenuity is
indeed surprising, and ha# most wonder-Q
fully sueceeded, Many millions have been
deceived by that artful composition; and I
have no doubt myself, that Tacitus knew
no more of V
tho 'reputed Agricola, than
Joshua did of the reputed Moses; and that
both liistorians-, and both hiSt01Ties am
equally entitled to their elaim of authen-1
ticity and genuineness,
.
"

there canbe little doubt that both, for this

I 'will divide them in Jacob, and scatter
them in Isrdel. "~We may observe that
the two Zodiacal Hshes neither rise, nor set
together. We find, in some ,of the ancient
Zodiacs, that one Hsh only is represented."
(Ed. Jud. p. 12.
_
This explanation is certainly an admira-
ble -proof that Simeon and Levi were
Pisces; yet I think more decisive confirma-
tion of the identity of Domitian with the
same sign, will be found in the Roman,
Historiansi If the twelve Patriarchs are
the twelve signs, it is evident that Jacob
and Israel must signify the heavens: the
Cwsars were descended from Tarquin,

which Mr. Bryant has shewn to be the
same as Tarchon, or Apéxwv, the 'great
serpent, which typified the heavens: when
Simeon and Levi are scattered in Jacob,
it evidently therefore means, they were
scattered in the heavens: if Domitian be
an emblem of the same sign, he too will be
represented in a similar manner; and I
cannot but think this has been done most
ingeniously by those Historians who have
related the mysterious and singular narra-
tive of the Turbot.
This fish, which is said to have been so
large, that it was deemed expedient to as-
semble the senate to deliberate on its cook-
ery, was
caught at Ancon. (Juvenal Satire,
iv, line 40.) This word is derived from An, a
fountain, éx, On, of the great Sun, or from
1N,pn,1~y. The fountain of the great Sun, is
_~_ ef»¢._.¢.__ ,
_
131. r
evidently aterm for the sign Aries, in which
the'Sun recoinmences its course; I have re-
ferred to the celestial globe, as Sir William
Drummond recommends. And I there find
one of the Zodiacal fishes actually situated
close to the_ head of the Ram, or at Ancon.
|
This coincidence explains the whole story.
The turbot is one Zodiacal fish, Domitian
himself 'is unavoidably the other ; they are
both divided or scattered in the heavens ;
and the
road; fron; Rome to the Adriatic,
is the ¢'v5v'6e¢rp.o5, or fetter, which connected
them together.
Such are the coincidences, the traditions,
and etymologies which will, I trust, con-
vince the admirers of the (Edipus Judaicus,
that the Roman Historians are as
allegori-
cal as the sacred writers, and that the
events related in history contain as
many
,
132i i
beautiful emblems as the narratives of
Scripture. I shall conclude by observing,
almost in the very words of Sir William
Drummond (p. 40.) : If the Roman Histo-
rians,
"
meant to make no allusions to the
signs of the Zodiac, it seems very strange
that we should find so
many circumstances
which seem
directly to 'relate to them."
This is an undoubted truth; and we trust
those who cannot refute our
arguments,
will at least regard them with candor and
respect, and resign their antiquated preju-
dices, to receive the "
New light" now
thrown upon the dark records of Scripture
and History. I cannot but hope that these
truths, which have been so
long concealed
to be at length so fortunately recovered, will
be duly appreciated, and extensively
circulated;
xll-
`
n
I NOW feel it incumbent on me, Gen~
tlemen, to state the motives which in-
duced me to condescend to irony and
banter, when the cause of Christianity is
discussed. I well know that this mode of
examining a question is seldom justifiable,
and generally nieets with universal repre-
hension. You will, however, be able to
form for me a
better apology than I can
possibly submit to you, when you take into
consideration the character and situation
of the author, and the probable consequen-
`
134'
ces of that method of Scripture interpre-
tation, proposed to us in the (Edipus

ornament and strength to society: 'hoiv
much Sir William Drummond has profited
by these advantages, I must leave to the
decision of others : on one
'
point' there
can be no diiference of opinion. In pro-
portion to the
influence which these united
excellencies must

danger to be apprehended from their mis-
applicationt Splendid' talents, superior
knowledge, the acquisitions of science, and
the authority of rank, when betrayed into

talent, when opposed to Christianity, are

utmost degree of possible deformity--like
the temples in Egypt described by Lucian :
magnificent and imposing in their exterior,

`
Consider the object of Revelation. It
was' bestowed ~
upon mankind by the
Supreme Being, for the same reason that
wool was
given to the lamb and strength
to the lion, because it was ,essential to them,
in that rank of creation in which God had
placed them; Without Revelation,
'
man
hadbeen, from the very beginning, of all
animals the most savage, ignorant, misera-

could he havepemerged from the

taste, the
elevations of science, .the consolations of

religion, and to the advantages and enjoy-
ments of social life? Our common sense'
must convince us, that if Revelation were
thus necessary, its iirst and chief object
must be, to reveal in plain, clear, and simple
languageathe facts it authenticates, and
the 'duties it prescribes. Since we shall
livesin another, as well as
_in the present
world, we may naturally expect that many
things may be proposed in the sacred pages,
which onr finite reason cannot now com-
prehend, and which may
l
therefore give
rise to various controversies, and divisions
of opinion: hub it is no less evident, that
the -historical _

must be intelligible tosevery reader- ; -it
must be literally interpreted, or it ceases
to be history. It -must contain a connected

and from the plain unperverted meaning
of the text, as it may be best ascertained
from the opinion of _the Christian church,
the analogy of faith, fair criticism, and
sound learning, we deduce
our hope of an
hereafter, our belief in the sublime myste-
ries of Redemption, .and all the other
important and venerated truths which' have
been received, and sanctioned by the
and wisest, of every age and nation.
But Sir William Drummond has inform-

Volumes might be filled with the detail
of the fatal consequences to society, if the
foundations of Christianity were thus re-
moved: and in what terms ought the
authors of so much misery' to the whole
race of man to be addressed? The use of
strong language is deemed inconsistent with
candor and liberality: we are not per-
mitted, even by the very customs of society,
to express the indignation which as Chris-
tians we must so deeply feel. If the friends
of

Revelation are clergymen, they are
at
once stigmatized -as servile, interested, bi-
goted, venal, and suspicious advocates.

of Revelation are laymen, they are

NOTE.
»
Many writers, particularly Origen, have undoubtedly
believed that some parts of _the first books of Scripture
were to be understood in an allegorical or mystical sense.
Lightfoot (vol. i. p. 873) asserts, that the uuhelieving and
apostatized Jews originated the custom of tuming the
Scriptures into allegory; though some suppose it was a
practice of very ancient date, and others, that it was taken
from the learned heathens, by many of the early fathers.
Philo is said to have taught the art to Clemens of Alex-
andria, who instructed Ofigen. Origcn excelled his mas-
ter; for he sometimes pleaded for a threefold sense, as
Augustine for a fourfold sense of many passages. Vide
Benson's Essay on the Unity of Sense, printed at the end
of Vol. IV. of Bishop Watson's Collection of Tracts.

Eusebius (Praap. Evang. l. 12. c. ll.) cites the phrase
*Wi TWG; &1r0#é-rev; Aéyoug Ménwg, secuudum arcanos

only to spiritual or moral inferences deducible from facts;
it had no reference whatever to astronomical emblems,
foisted into the text at someunknown period, and mis-
taken from the moment of their introduction for real his-
tory. One of the most zealous advocates for the mystical
sense of Scrinture, was Dr. Bumet. In his celebrated
Archmologia, p. 279, he observes,
"
duplex erat apud ve-
teres, maxime orientales, Theologiaxn et
Philosophiain
tradendi modus, `8»;y,é8»;;, ual ¢i1r6}§1;-ro;; atque duplici hoc
stylo, in rebus naturalibus explicandis, uti mihi videtur
Scriptura sacra: quandoque sese accommndans sd_ populi
eaptum, quandnque minmulrimmn veritatem." But even
this author makes no attempt to change the facts of Scrip-
ture into astronomical emblems, though by far the most
speculative and fanciful writer of his day. Neither did
this author feel much regard for the opinions of his con-
temporaries, or the authority of other learned men. Many
passages in his Archmologia are irrevereutly written, and
are highly objectionablef He olfended the common sense
of the Christian world, and thus deprived himself of the
very possibility ofdoing good, though an
eminent scholar,
and an
exemplary and amiable man. I shall merely add,

that Sir'William Drummond's system seems to be founded
on the same sort of
Icoincidenees, by the use of which
Burnet, or any other ingenious writer, would be always
able to framea consistent hypothesis.
