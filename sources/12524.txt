A guardian being escorted me on my wandering journey. The being shortly after meeting said I must go back, we talked I asked many questions. The hospital doctors said I had no brain activity; my father flew in the priest that baptized me, from out of State to deliver my last rites. I would keep coming back to the room where I was lying. I viewed the people who were there at the different times. Every time I, (we) went on a journey, my guardian would say you must go back to your body. I would say, 'No it is too nice here.' This happened several times. Then on our last trip away from my room, my guardian said 'It is not your time. We have other things for you to do. We will come and get you at the right time.' I found myself back in the room with my guardian in a corner. I said I don't want to go back it is too peaceful here. The guardian said in a calm voice, 'It is not your time we, will come when it is your time.'
