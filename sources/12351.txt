  		              		Experience Description   

  My first experience was when I tripped over a box, and my legs going in  different directions. I was by myself, so I was  screaming at the top my lungs. I  don’t know for how long, but my husband came home. He  called 911 because my entire right side had a bone sticking out of it.  It took the emergency medical technician (EMT) a good while to get me calm and into the ambulance. 

  The next thing I know, I am at the hospital. The  EMT driver has already gotten me out of the ambulance and was pulling the stretcher inside the hospital. I was flying on top of my body and felt no pain until I got back into my body. 

  They operated on me  next. I was released two days later on a Sunday. The following Tuesday night, my husband said I sat up in our bed a rubbed his arm as I  fell out of bed. I woke up in the emergency room, saying that I did not know what was going on. I felt like it was dark with  sparks of light  all around me. I felt as if I was trapped and trying to fight my way out.  I told  myself that this is not right. I made my choice and finally came back to consciousness. I  begged my husband to get me out of the hospital becasue I felt as if evil surrounded me. The doctors told me that  I had a stroke.
