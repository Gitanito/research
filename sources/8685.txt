  Hello, I   noticed your site and I wanted to find a way&nbsp; to honor a first love between   Glenn and I , it's a love that has withstood all tests of time and&nbsp; a love   that's so pure and precious.

  We met when I   was a tender age of 15 and a half. He had surgery at McFarland Hospital in   Lebanon Tennessee on June 16, 1986 and the next day his brother Tommy (Rest in   Peace Tommy We love you!) was about to get on the elevator to go to see him,   Tommy seen me and called me over and said, &quot;Come with me I've got someone I want   you to meet&quot; I looked puzzled at him as we got on the elevator and rode it to   the second floor, I followed behind Tommy as he entered Room 219 but before   entering he allowed me to go in first. Glenn&nbsp; was laying&nbsp; there in bed and when   our eyes met something clicked inside me as if my heart fluttered for a moment,   I was very shy and Tommy introduced Glenn and I and Tommy asked me to have a   seat and I did, as soon as I sat down Tommy gave Glenn a little wink and made a   quick excuse to leave the room. I was so nervous but he left anyway after   grinning at me and walking out. Glenn began to speak as I didn't know what to   say right away. We began to chat a bit as Tommy returned to the room after some   time away. I had to return back to work downstairs and I got up and told Glenn   I'd see him the next day.&nbsp; Right before I left I noticed Tommy was grinning   again, I said &quot;nothing.&quot; and told them both goodbye.&nbsp; I went downstairs and   went back to work.

  I had flowers   and cards to take to patient rooms so I quickly looked for ALL the second floor   deliveries and loaded them on the cart and quickly went back upstairs and walked   as slowly as I could by Glenn's Room and smiled Innocently as I passed, I seemed   to blush a lot when I was that age but especially when Tommy or Glenn spoke to   me. I couldn't wait till the next day to see Glenn. I only worked 4 hours that   next day and I came in early just&nbsp; to see him. There after we&nbsp; talked more and   more and spent more and more time together and after about a week I started   having feelings for him and found myself&nbsp; falling for him day by day after that,   after a few weeks&nbsp; of spending time with him at the hospital.&nbsp; I had such   trouble telling him my feelings so I decided to write it in a letter for him,   one day I sat down after work and wrote him a 6 page letter, it explained just   how I felt for him and how much I appreciated Tommy introducing us. The next day   I had to work and I got ready for work early and went to the hospital and before   leaving the house I picked a Rose from mom's garden without her knowing of   course lol... I took that Rose and Took the letter with me and went to see   Glenn. When I arrived on the second floor and walked into his room it was empty   and the bed was made and my heart sank... I asked the nurse where he was and she   said he left an hour prior to my arrival.&nbsp; I went back downstairs with that   rose and letter and I sat in the Volunteer break room and the tears started   flowing. I felt nauseated as my supervisor came by she asked me if I was okay.&nbsp;   I told her no... and asked if I could go home. She allowed me to go. I got home   and laid on my bed still in my uniform and Cried for hours.&nbsp; All I could   think of was&nbsp; that I'd never see him again, and for over 24 years I never seen   him or his brother.

  Tommy sadly   Passed away in 2006 and I never got to tell him thank you for introducing me to   my soul mate.

  On April   21,2010&nbsp; Glenn and I reconnected again through Facebook and When I received that   Friend request from him I couldn't believe it was really him, I cried so hard   when i seen his picture, especially when he told him how could he forget me   after all I was the one who visited him most after his surgery back then. I told   him that night how much I had loved him all these years and he felt the same for   me and we both decided we wanted to be&nbsp; together and we've been inseparable   every since. chatting on cam/voice or on the phone or through messengers. On   August 5th 2010 he moved from Georgia to Tennessee and came and got me and We've   been together and so very happy every since, and it's living proof that A first   love does last forever...     </body>
