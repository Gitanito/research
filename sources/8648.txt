  I love   telling my story because it still mystifies and thrills me. The meeting took   seven months of dreaming, after my NDE that I won't get into. A few months   following the NDE, I felt ready to share my life again after being alone for   many years. I've always had precognitive dreams since I can remember and decided   to consciously use it to find out who my soulmate is. Soon, I had a dream within   a dream in which I thought I was awake. My sister and I lived together and she   woke me up (in the dream) to say that I had visitors.&nbsp; I lived upstairs in our   house and asked her to send them up. There was a young good looking man about my   age (35)&nbsp; with two Native Americans. I didn't know them. One Native American was   male about 50-60 years old, handsome, strong, and well built. The other was a   woman who I couldn't quite grab a hold off - as if she was fading in and out. I   just thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. 
  
  The Native American man led the way through my two-room space, as if he knew the   layout, and motioned for us to sit on the floor in a circle and he took out a   peace pipe. I was waiting for them to explain who they were and why'd they'd   come. He lit the pipe and they all smoked from it. I refused when it came my   turn and the man kept pushing me to smoke. The young man laughed and that pissed   me off. I remember giving him a wicked look. I smoked and the Native American   man said, &quot;Remember him.&quot; And I woke up so confused because I thought I was   awake!
  
  Many dreams of this man followed of just us doing things together - picking him   up at work, walking in the rain laughing, he doing standup comedy, us in house   with a double door in a kitchen that led outside, sitting in a restaurant and   seeing Ike Turner of Ike and Tina Turner (???)..LOLOL&nbsp; - just snippets of   scenes. By this time, I understood who I was dreaming of and would meet him. 
  
  But during the NDE, the absolutely loving Spirit who I met told me that my life   was in California (3,000 miles away at the time) and I HAD to move before the   end of the year. Now, this is a state that I feared the most because of   earthquakes. Never in my life would I consider moving here, plus I didn't know a   soul here. I told my family and my sister said yes, let's do it! At the same   time I was afraid of not meeting my dream man, but decided I was not going to   hang around and forgo an adventure just for some man.&nbsp; We moved and had a super   rough time finding jobs, living in a motel for months, lying to our family back   East that everything was just dandy.&nbsp; Well, a 2nd sister didn't believe it. At   this time, my 2nd sister of Gen.X was fully into the Internet talking to people   online that I thought was very strange and dangerous. 
  
  Well, one night, we got a call from a guy who said Second Sister, who he'd met&nbsp;   online and at some meet up, asked him to check up on us. I was beyond furious -   how dare she put us in this situation. He said he'd been checking all the   Travelodges and couldn't find us but was finally happy to have done so. We   arranged for him to take us to dinner and when he arrived and I opened the door,   I was completely stunned to find Dream Man facing me. I had previously asked for   a sign to know him just in case. Now my head was like it exploded and my ears   popped as I just stood there looking at him and he at me. I was lost until my   sister said, don't be rude - let the man in.
  
  Just want to say that all the snippets of dream-time came through, especially he   showing us his peace pipes on a visit to his home and telling of his strong   feeling of connection to Native Americans and culture. I believe the two people   are his Guides and they were simply introducing him to me. 
  
  Yes, he did standup. Yes, he'd pick me up in the mornings to drop him off at   work so my sister and I had a car during job hunts. Yes, we saw Ike Turner the   very first night while at the restaurant.&nbsp; Yes, his house had a kitchen door.   Yes, within weeks we were caught in the rain while visiting one of the local   Missions and it felt so good. Yes, one night at a jazz club an unusual thing   happened - the comic performing decided to have members of the audience try   their hand at comedy. To my amazement, my then-boyfriend volunteered to   participate! It was just wonderful.
  
  And yes, he is like my brother, my father, but my lover and the best friend I've   ever had almost 15years now and still going strong. We've been married for   almost 10years.     </body>
