  		              		Experience Description   

    My Nana had passed away two years prior, yet I was sitting at my Nana's kitchen table in her old house. She was really young; like 25 years old. I physically didn't recognize her, as I have never even seen a picture of her as a young adult. She had flowing, straight-red hair that was cut into a bobbed style that was very different from the curly, short light-orangish hair lady I knew growing up. But I knew it was her. I felt it. She had the fireplace roaring beside the kitchen table.   I had never seen that fireplace lit before. I could feel the heat from the fire. My nana stood up from her seat and greeted me. She said, 'Hello Blake, please sit down with me.' She was wearing a beautiful, yellow and green dress which was odd to me because  I had never seen her dress up before. 

As I sat down, she offered me a drink,  'Here Blake, have some tea with me.'   As she poured me a cup of tea, she said,  'Drink up, Blake.' I picked up the cup and took a sip. I was surprised as this was not tea. It was so strong, like liquor, but had an intense fullness of something almost herbal with a slight taste of lemon.

  I glanced into my Nana's eyes.  I was about to tell her what I thought about  the taste, but she stared sternly back into my eyes saying, 'You have to drink it all.' Then she tipped the glass up with her fingers like she was helping me guzzle the tea faster. 

  'Ok. Great. Now, we have much to talk about and not much time. You need to listen,' she said.  I nodded and just sat there.

  She continuied, 'Do you remember when we talked about the money?' I answered,   'Yes.' She replied,   'You need to put it where no one will look, or they will take it. You are lucky, though, because you have two middle names. You need to look for the middle names, keep it there and no one will find it.' Suddenly, the mood changed; almost as if  Nana was reacting to something bad that gave her some anxiety or a sense of urgency. She began looking past me as she stood up.

  So I stood up too. I went to turn to see what she was looking at but Nana grabbed my hands and held them tight between us. Pulling me closer to her, she looked deeply into my eyes.  I remember looking into the intensity of her eyes and that's all I could see.

  'I am happy now; you need to tell your mother I am o.k.,' she said.  'I will,' I replied.

  Then I felt an overwhelming emotion of panic from her eyes,  'You need to wake up, WAKE UP!' she yelled.

  Then I woke up in the hospital room. I was so confused, looking up to my mother and wife, along with the nurse. They were all looking down on me.   'Welcome back,' said the nurse as she smiled and started changing my I.V. bag.     
  
Background Information:       

Gender:   	Male  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 June 2016  

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes    Surgery-related. While under general anesthesia.      Illness, trauma or other condition not considered life threatening.   I was supposed to have an easy, outpatient surgery to repair a fistula. However, in the recovery room my incision was not properly cauterized and I began to bleed heavily. This bleed went undetected for quite some time because I was covered with a sheet. I only notice when I felt something wet on my leg. I reached under the sheet to see what it was and when I looked at my hand it was covered in blood. At this moment, I noticed blood streaming off the table. I reached for my buzzer to call the nurse and when she drew back the curtains surrounding me, I saw the panic in her eyes. She called a code and two nurses rushed to me. They rolled me on my side. It was at that point, I realized just how much blood was on the ground. They were throwing towels down on the floor so they didn't slip. Luckily, my surgeon hadn't left the building and met me in his street clothes, running beside my gurney as I was be rush into the operating room. I had to sign a blood transfusion waiver, which was ironic because when I grabbed the sheet, my hand was still soaked in blood.  I  smeared blood all over the form. The last thing I remember was seeing the panic in the operating room nurse's eyes as they were getting ready to transfer me to the operating table from the gurney. The surgeon bust through the door yelling, 'Get him out!,' directing the anesthesiologist, to quickly anesthetize me.

  How do you consider the content of your experience?        Both pleasant AND distressing  

Did you feel separated from your body?      No    

  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   It was like there were no distractions. I could feel more senses and emotions. I really felt the emotion of my Nana when she was experiencing strong emotions. I could feel the panic, almost hear it and felt it deeper in my head.  
  
  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         From the beginning, right until the experience ended.  
  
Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         No     

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         More vivid than usual  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       My vision was crystal clear. However, there was some periphery distortion, like crystal-reflection and it was slight blurry or almost refracted would describe it better. But this did not interfere with my vision, if that makes sense.  
  
  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      I was able to zoom-in my hearing on things. When I looked at the fire, my hearing zoomed in on it such that it was  all I could hear. The same happened with the pouring of the tea and the sound of the tea cup being placed on the saucer in front of me.  
  
Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

  Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Uncertain.     I was just there in the kitchen doorway, but it did start with a moment of blurriness. It was like opening your eyes after a nap and then looking at the sun in the summer. It took  a second for my eyes to focus.  
  
Did you see any beings in your experience?         No  

  Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         Yes.     My Nana, but as a young women. She had passed away 2 years prior to this experience.  
  
Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         No  

Did you see an unearthly light?         No     

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         No       

  What emotions did you feel during the experience?         I felt happy, calm, and warm. Then I felt startled, panicked, and anxious.  
  
Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Happiness  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       No  

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         No       

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

  Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a definite conscious decision to return to life.   I was told very forcefully that I need to 'wake up'  
  
God, Spiritual and Religion:       

  What was your religion prior to your experience?      No comment.   Not religious  
  
Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         No       

  What is your religion now?         No comment.   Not religious  
  
  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I struggle with the thought 'what's next after this, or what happens when you die.' Those thoughts haunt me. I am not a believer of the church system but do belief there is  more than this life.  
  
  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Uncertain.     No real difference  
  
Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         No     

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     I was able to be visited by my nana, but felt maybe there was a reason why I shouldn't have been in contact with her. Or maybe a time limit of connection could be the reason why I so urgently needed to wake up. Maybe if I didn't wake up immediately, my return would be compromised.  
  
During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         No       

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      No     

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         I am uncertain if an afterlife exists.     My nana told me 'she was happy now.'  
  
Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         No       

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Slight changes in my life       

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Uncertain.   I felt very connected to the feelings of everything in the room, such as my nana, the fire, and the table. I was acutely aware of  how they  impacted on me. All the emotions were very warm and soft at first, but by the end of the experience the emotions were cold and harsh.  
  
How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I remember the emotions and senses so accurately. I can almost recall the senses when I think about it.  

  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Uncertain.     I definitely can read people more. For instance, when someone is telling me a story, my inner voice will say, 'they're lying.' Or I can tell if someone is uncomfortable in a situation or conversation.  
  
  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          That it was almost my nana trying to finish a conversation we had a few years prior at Christmas time. But we were interrupted and my nana told me that we will finish the conversation another time. But, we never had the chance before she died.  
  
  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I did wait some time before I told my wife. She thought I should tell my mom about it. I was very uncertain if I should, but I did. Her reaction was very accepting of it and ask me to tell my uncle (her brother).  
  
Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I viewed it as a connection that was able to happen because my body was in a compromised state. It was aAlmost like I had an increased release of something. I was allowed to temporarily make a trip to have a visit, or I was able to be connected  so I could pass information back to here.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     I still feel the same. I just wish I had more time during it.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

  Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         I felt like the connection I had with my nana may have been against the rules. My nana was a bit of a trouble-maker or rule-breaker in her lifetime. I feel like this connection was sneaky. Also, the scenario was generated by her to a place we both knew or she knew well. It was a  place where I would feel comfortable and  wouldn't resist the connection.  
  
  Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         Maybe ask 'if you felt like you were being tapped or linked into for the purpose of a conversation.'   Also, ask if, 'people felt they weren't supposed to be having their conversation.'
