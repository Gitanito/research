TO
THE SUPREME PERFECTION OF ALL CREATION IN UNITY,
BEYOND THE CLOUDS OF SCIENCE, RELIGION AND
NATIONALITY: THE SANCTUARY OF NATURE
WHERE IS "THE IMAGE OF THE INVISIBLE
GOD, THE FIRST-BORN OF EVERY:...., .
CREATURE." — Paul the Apostle, : ''J'
Colossians, 1-15.
"Man is indeed abroad to satisfy needs which are more to him
than food and clothing. He is out to find himself. Man's history
is the history of his journey to the unknown in the quest of the
realization of his immortal self—his soul. Through the rise and
fall of empires; through the building up of gigantic piles of wealth
and the ruthless scattering of them upon the dust; through the
creation of vast bodies of symbols that give shape to his dreams
and aspirations, and the scattering of them away like the play
things of an outworn infancy; through his forging of magic keys
with which to unlock the mysteries of creation, and through his
throwing away of this labor of ages to go back to his workshop
and work up afresh some new form; yes, through it all man is
marching from epoch to epoch toward the fullest realization of his
soul—the soul which is greater than the things man accumulates,
the deeds he accomplishes, the theories he builds; the soul whose
onward course is never checked by death or dissolution. * * *
Yes, they are coming, the pilgrims, one and all—coming to their
true inheritance of the world; they are ever broadening their con
sciousness, ever seeking a higher and higher unity, ever approach
ing nearer to the one central Truth which is all-comprehensive.
" 'Set yourselves free from the shell of self; know your true
soul and be saved from- the grasp of the self which imprisons you.'
Our revelatory men have always been those who lived the life of
self-sacrifice. The higher nature in man always seeks for some
thing which transcends itself and yet is its deepest truth. When
it finds illumination, it forgets itself in a moment, holds the Light
high and serves it with everything it has; for therein is its revela
tion. This revelation is the freedom which Buddha preached."
—Rabindranath Tagore.
"Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."
—St. John, 8-32.
"And God said: Let us make man in our image, after our like
ness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and
over the foul of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth,
and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."
—First Book of Moses, Genesis.

Ilfatfjor•a preface
The seeker for Truth, the scientist, climbs the steep mountain
of absolute knowledge, in order to serve humanity more fully.
Each step in advance is built out of exact thought, observation,
and work. If patience and perseverance ever lead above earth's
clouds to high altitudes, the unfolding panorama is a constant
incentive to greater discovery. At last the top of some peak is
attained. The barrier to perfect vision is overcome. The complete
circle of earth's and heaven's great bowl unfolds into view. This
bowl transforms through deeper sight into a great sphere with all
creation (mineral, floral, animal, and human) drawn to the central
Sovereign of Dominion. The old day is finished. The sun and
moon balance on the opposite horizon. A violet light gathers to
crown this deeper revelation of Nature. Just so, the Truth is
finally approached. The top of the great pyramid of human evo
lution is reached. This is the entrance into the next higher octave
of Nature. Here the ascending anode of finished earthly evolution
draws close to the descending cathod of Immortal Life. Here in
the ultra-violet Light of more perfect perception, Man and Woman
step forth from human chrysalis—master of earth's laws and
wayshower to greater dominion in the kingdoms of Nature's higlier
and higher realms of Perfection.
The decline of the old day and the dawn of the New Day are
shown in "the signs of the times." Even in the world of science
is seen "the handwriting on the wall." Thought flies from earthly
theory to eternal Truth. The universe is built by exact law in
every octave, only awaiting to be fathomed. So the mind gravi
tates from uncertain speculation to absolute proof and reality.
But how are Nature's higher octaves revealed in order to be grasped
in their perfect Presence? The old world is seen and heard by
earthly sight and hearing. The new universe is seen and heard
by the dawn of ultra-violet perceptions won by higher evolution.
These penetrate the very walls and foundations of the old science.
The super-man, the God-man, unfolds with super-powers from
the chrysalis of earth-man —and his science comes forth with him.
He sees the inner powers and construction of electricity in its
relation to transmutation and transmission between the fourth
and third dimensions of Nature. He sees the four-dimensional
inner entity of every three-dimensional earthly body (in mineral,
floral, animal, and human degree) as it descends to three-dimen

sional realm of earth at birth (forming upon itself its own earthly
cloak), and departs again to four-dimensional realm of Nature at
death (leaving its earthly cloak discarded). This super-man is
crowned with an Eye far more powerful than any microscope or
telescope—the evolved conarium, third eye of the human brain.
The two earth eyes see only a small part of Nature—with earth,
sun, moon, planets and stars as illusion distorted by laws of optics,
perspective, reflection, refraction. The universe as seen through
this single cyclopean Eye of higher evolution, this penetrating
searchlight of Truth, is turned out-side in—revealing "a new
heaven and a new earth." It is inherited by this greater vision—
looking backward and forward through time, downward and upward
in dimensions of Nature. The Super-man and Woman "live and
move and have their being" in the midst of eternal law. The gifts
of dominion over the earth are tele-vision, tele-hearing, tele-writing,
and many other perfections. These are won by ascending evolution
into the vast powers and realms of Nature's higher and higher
octaves—called God's Creation.
When the Sovereign of Creation with immortal Crown won,
steps down to earth again in final work, who first sees this invisible
and radiant Crown ? The minerals transmute at touch from baser
metals to pure gold. The flowers turn their radio-blossoms to
receive the messages for higher octaves. The animals, from least
to greatest, gather to acknowledge the ruler of their kingdom.
The adder and the lion no longer need their weapons of defense
against a cruel earth-man. For here is the Messenger of the
Creator come to earth with the royal Diadem, seen first as that
love called Mercy by the wise and faithful dumb creatures who
have served and waited so long for their Redeemer, the Good
Shepherd.
Those earth people who are blind and deaf to Nature's higher
octaves, cannot now realize these perfect laws and realities of
Creation. But when they awaken, they will see as a panorama
the greater works of evolution, revealed at this time of earth's dark
and brightening history. This is the Dawn of the New Day. It
heralds the return among us of the Creator's Messengers endowed
as the ancient God-men or Sons of God, who see the Sovereign of
All Creation.

SPIRITUAL COMMUNION
"He that is versed in the sacred wisdom of the Most High,_
in the image of the Almighty he shall be established. *
: :\t :
With His creative law will He cover thee and under His mysterious
wings will He shield and safeguard thee in His truth, ?. I *'.
His angels will guide thee and guard thee in all thy ways.•"- *•• *• *•
—Psalm 91:
Translation from original Aramaic, by F. J. Bielsky.
"And there will I meet with thee, and I will commune with
thee from above the Mercy Seat, from between the two Cherubims
which are upon the Ark of the testimony."
—Second Book of Moses, Exodus.
"Praise be to Allah, the God of all creation. Guide us in the
right path." —The Koran.
"For where two or three are gathered together in my name,
there am I in the midst of them." —St. Matthew, 18-20.
"Buddha, the cosmic Lord, is not a mere spirit. His body is
the whole material existence, and even a grain of dust partakes
of his spiritual life and owes its existence to him. The world is a
living organism, manifesting its life everywhere and endeavoring
to attain full self-consciousness in every particle. These activities
are not merely external motions of the material world, but are
growths out of a deeper foundation of life and are controlled by
spiritual forces. Such inner meanings of the world life can be
comprehended by us and realized in our personal lives, when we
identify ourselves with the cosmos. They are mysterious to the
ordinary mind, but realities to those who have mastered the secrets
and worked them out in life." —M. Anesaki,
Professor of the Science of Religion,
Imperial University, Tokyo.
"Worship those on high as though they stand before you.
Offer honors to them as they may be in your immediate presence."
—Confucius.
"I go forth against my foes endowed with the defence of
truth and good. I cross the heavens and traverse the earth.
Though a dweller in the life beyond, I tread the earth like one
alive, following in the footsteps of the blessed spirits. I have the
gift of living a million years."—Book of the Day of Resurrection,
by Thoth the Scribe, Egypt, 4500 B. C.

8 SPIRITUAL COMMUNION
" 'The Light of the World, which dispelled the darkness of
illusion.' From the very beginning it was the belief of the Bud
dhists that- their communion included all things visible and in
visible. -: t'hjs new aspect of life, now realized by the Master and
■inspired- in- his followers, was expressed as the gospel of the all-
-embracing- S6lfr Road whose rule should be the universal fellowship
,g-f•Jife%: .This -Sole Road is the Pathway to Immortality and its
final goal is Nirvana, the eternal haven of life, the realm of
spiritual communion. The abodes of man were purified; and
throughout we see the Buddhist ideal of communion, no longer
made sensible in temples and statues, in ceremonies and rituals,
but manifested in the homes of human beings, as a religion of
simple beauty, as a cult of Nature and of spiritual life. Viewed
in this way—the beings and things of the world exist in order to
realize their participation in the omnipresent activities of the
Lord, and to live, think and express themselves as he does. We
human beings, furnished with body and mind, are a concrete mani
festation of the whole cosmic structure; and are destined to repre
sent the cosmic life in the personal life; but being shrouded in
illusion and selfishness we have lost sight of the inner tie which
unites us with the Great Illuminator, and of our real communion
with other beings. It is, therefore, the purpose of Buddha in
his innumerable manifestations as various deities and phenomena,
to enlighten us in regard to our original kinship with him, and in
our destiny to restore it, so that we may achieve a full participa
tion in cosmic life." —M. Anesaki.
"In the name of the gracious and compassionate God. Recite
in the name of thy Lord, who created man and taught man to
write, recite what Allah has revealed." —The Koran.

SPIRITUAL AWAKENING 9
SPIRITUAL AWAKENING
"When a man lives the life of Avidya, he is confined within
his self. This is spiritual sleep; his consciousness is not fully
awake to the highest reality that surrounds him, therefore he
knows not the reality of his own soul. When he attains Bodhi,
i. e., the awakement from the sleep of self to the perfection of
consciousness, he becomes Buddha." —Rabindranath Tagore.
"Listen to me, ye sons of immortal spirit, ye who live in the
heavenly abode, I have known the Supreme Life of All, whose
Light shines forth from beyond the darkness."
—Upanishads.
"The Blessed Lord said: But verily thou art not able to behold
me with thine eyes; the divine eye I give unto thee.
"There Pandava beheld the whole universe, divided into mani
fold parts, standing in one in the body of the Deity of Deities.
Then overwhelmed with astonishment, his hair upstanding, bowed
down his head to the Shining One, and with joined hands spake:
"Within Thy Form, O God, the Gods I see,
All grades of beings with distinctive marks;
Brahma, the Lord, upon His lotus-throne,
The Rishis all, and Serpents, the Divine. —
With mouths, eyes, arms, breasts, multitudinous,
I see Thee everywhere, unbounded Form.—
Radiant, Thou touchest heaven, rainbow-hued,
With opened mouths and shining vast-orbed eyes. —
Blazing as fire, as sun dazzling the gaze,
Lofty beyond all thought, unperishing,
Thou treasure-house supreme, all-immanent;
Eternal Dharma's changeless Guardian, Thou;
As Immemorial Man I think of Thee.—
Unnumbered arms, the sun and moon Thine eyes,
Supreme receptacle of all that lives;
Knower and known, the dwelling place on high;
In Thy vast Form the universe is spread.—
This Thy forthstreaming Life bewilders me,—
Nought know I anywhere, no shelter find.
Mercy, O God, refuge of all the worlds,
By Thee alone are filled the earth, the heavens,
And all the regions that are stretched between; —
The triple worlds sink down, O mighty One,
Before Thine awful manifested Form."
—Bhagavad-Gita.
"The Image of the invisible God, the First-born of every
Creature." —Paul the Apostle.

10 SPIRITUAL AWAKENING
"Buddha is the perfect person who attained the life of the
all-embracing wisdom and love, thus identifying himself with the
cosmos and all the lives in it. The final sub-stratum of Buddha-
hood is, therefore, the cosmos—including its spiritual and material
aspects, and Buddha is the Lord who rules it, not from above, but
from within. His spirit is the cosmic soul which, like a seed,
evolves out of itself all the phenomena of the universe. The cosmic
life thus regarded as the enactment of the infinite communion
ruled by Buddha, the cosmic soul, may be and must be grasped
and experienced by the soul who lives the life not of an individual
but of the whole communion; and this soul, when it transcends the
limit of selfish narrowness and individuality, can include all exist
ence within its domain, and discover in itself the germs of all
phenomena. This means also an expansion of individual life to
the compass of the universe by living in communion and partici
pation with the cosmic life. The absorption of the self into the
worlds' amounts to the identification of the microcosmos with the
macrocosmos." —M. Anesaki.
"I and my Father are one." St. John, 10-30.

14 MESSAGE FROM SWAMI VIVEKANANDA
MESSAGE FROM SWAMI VIVEKANANDA
Received in Writing at Halcyone Woods, California,
May 16, 1926, 9 P. M.
Dear Ruth:
Very few of earth understand the laws of spiritual Communion.
Through this power of direct contact with spiritual realms, the
complete reality of the spiritual Self can be brought forth on
earth. But this is only through the understanding of the law and
scientific truth of Nature that Man and Woman are made in, the
likeness and Image of the Creator. When the consciousness of
the individual attains the realization of this law, then direct
communication with spiritual realms of the earth is possible. This
is a law of Nature as exact and real as a proposition in mathe
matics. Its reality has been proved and brought forth by great
Teachers and Masters of earth. The great central teaching of the
Christ and Buddha was spiritual dominion and perfection through
Communion with spiritual realms and powers. This is unity with
one's spiritual Self which brings forth all the perfection and
reality of the Creator. This Communion brings to earth the
Image of the Creator in all abundance and spiritual dominion,
attained when the consciousness reaches through evolution the
understanding of the perfect likeness. This is brought about by
the growth of a great love and understanding for all the creations
of Nature. This finally proves to be the key which unlocks the
great truth that man and woman as originally created contain or
encompass all Creation or Nature. This breadth and height of
love for all creation finally reveals the love of the Creator for
all Creation. The attainment of this Unity of consciousness as
brooding over and guarding all creation, whether mineral or
floral or animal or human, finally unlocks or unveils the great
truth of Creation that Man and Woman are made as the Creator.
They are created in the image and likeness of the Creator. But
they must evolve to this great truth in a cycle which first separates
from the Creator as individual and returns to the Creator in perfect
understanding. This return to the Creator is the crown of evolu
tion and the attainment of Immortality. It is the return to the
consciousness of the complete perfection of all Creation contained
within,—the Unity with the Creator, or the Kingdom of Heaven

MESSAGE FROM SWAMI VIVEKANANDA 15
within: "I and my Father are one." True spiritual Communion
with angelic realms is the goal of earthly evolution, —the over
coming of death and the attainment of Immortality. For the
Creator, or Heavenly Abode of Creation in all Perfection, dwells
in Immortality. The people of earth are barely conscious
that high spiritual and angelic realms exist. There is a com
memoration of Communion as a religious form. But as yet
it is only rarely understood as a law of Natare connecting
earth realm with high spheres. This Communion is a tuning
of consciousness to the Abode of the Creator as the manifesta
tion of Creation in Perfection. It is an exact and real law, for
Man and Woman are constructed in the likeness and image
of the Creator. So when they are able to be conscious of or exactly
in harmony with the Creator's conception of creation in Perfection,
—then they are in spiritual Communion. In this Way they con
tact the great dominion and powers of the Creator, —which is the
Presence of Creation in its entirety in spiritual Perfection. This
includes every creation of all the Kingdoms of Nature and all
spiritual Selves of individuals. It is a vast spiritual insight into
the realms of the Creator where all individuals and all minerals,
flowers, animals, —live in the most marvelous spiritual Perfection.
It is difficult for earthly people at present to grasp the marvelous
perfection of this creation in the Angelic Abode. But this revela
tion now comes to earth. For its consciousness now sleeps in the
inner nature of each individual of earth. Very few live in direct
spiritual Communion as you do. The religions have faith and
hope, but have not yet grasped spiritual Communion as a reality
and law of Nature. Earth looks dark to us from high realms
except where consciousness is tuned to Perfection as yours is.
Then we see a bright light not visible to earth sight. This is
spiritual consciousness of the Creator as encompassing all creation
in Perfection of radiant love and guardianship. The great central
reality of the teaching of all great Masters as the Christ and
Buddha and those others who have tried to bring the truth to
earth, is this direct spiritual Communion which comes when the
self-world dissolves and reveals the perfect world of the Creator
with every creation in Perfection and in spiritual Presence. Self
dissolves and the body becomes all Nature in Perfect Love, or the
Perfect Likeness. With this expansion of consciousness or dissolv

ing of the little self, —comes like a flash of spiritual Light the
dawn of the Image of the Creator, the Unity of all Creation in
Perfection. Then comes forth the Perfect spiritual Self in al]
powers and dominion over earth, —made as all creation in Per
fection. When earth is more prepared, this revelation of spiritual
Communion will be brought forth more and more perfect. Now
darkness is over the schools and the churches as we see them.
For science reaches to every realm of Nature, and faith and hope
must be brought to fruition in direct spiritual Communion as a
law and reality of Nature,—the understanding of the Creator, and
Man and Woman made in the Image and likeness. The shepherds
of ancient times saw the star of truth and heard the angelic
voices, because they were in consciousness of the Creator brooding
in love and guardianship over all Nature's creations. They were
in tune with the angelic realms and saw the Presence of the
Messengers from high Powers. They lived in Communion with
angelic realms. So they were often called to great works, as King
David and later Joan of Arc. It is only the simple love of the
shepherd that radiates to all creation, and draws down the Powers
on high. This is spiritual Communion. This is to live in Immor
tality. For the love of the Creator radiates to every realm, —and
dissolves every barrier. There is no death, but only the Presence
of Angelic Realms. This is spiritual Communion, —as lived by
the Christ, Buddha, and all the great Teachers. They are all of
the Order of Melkesedeck, —for they serve only the Most High and
humanity. All earth-made systems will dissolve before this great
revelation and Presence of the Creator's Perfections. All Nature
draws into Unity here in spiritual Communion, —as it did in
ancient times, —where the Moon and the Sun gather in guardian
ship over Nature. Earth people today are so far in thought from
the Perfection of Nature and the understanding of its powers, —
that I cannot reveal greater truths at present. This is all in
Nature's spiritual laws, —and understood by the tribes who in
ancient times dwelt here. Earth is in great darkness today, but
the Light of spiritual Presence dawns. The Moon and the Sun
guard many ■
treasures. What earth sees as Nature is only a
mask over the treasures of the Creator, —gained by the law of
spiritual Communion and the revelation of its Reality. I will write
soon again. (Signed) SWAMI VIVEKANANDA.

MESSAGE FROM F. L. RAWSON
Received in Writing at Halcyone Woods, California,
December S, 1924, S P. M.
Dear Friend:
It is a great pleasure to me to be able to write this message
this evening. I have a great deal to write of, as I have learned
wonderful truths since passing from earth plane to higher realms.
The higher spheres are more wonderful than those of earth are
able to imagine, and many of their truths are soon to be brought
to earth. I am to help constantly in this work that the Masters of
high spheres are directing for you to bring forth on earth. It
is all predestined and told of in the prophesies of the Bible, and
called: The End of the World. But it is the spiritual unfoldment
of the earth as it unfolds like a flower into a blossom from a bud.
The old shell of earth thought and limitation and ignorance is to
be cast off, and the wonderful spiritual earth in all its spiritual
truths and laws is to come forth. This includes the elimination
of the process of Death, which is the passage of consciousness
through the veil of darkness that hides the earth plane from the
near spheres beyond, called Heaven. All I taught of is fairly true,
but I have many more truths to bring forth now. The earth must
learn to understand the truth of spiritual Nature written of in the
Bible: That the perfect spiritual Man and Woman are made in
the image and likeness of the Creator and contain the perfect
ideas and realties of all creation. The dominion spoken of is the
dominion of the spiritual unity of Love and Life over every
spiritual idea and creation contained in the perfect Man and
Woman in the image and likeness of the Creator. Thus the like
ness is the perfected earthly body in its spiritual sense as including
all the creations of Nature which appear to earthly consciousness
to be outside t>f the body or earthly self. The perfect earthly
consciousness contains all these creations, and they are to be
proved as part of the complete spiritual likeness of the perfect
Man and Woman. The Image is the truly spiritual self which
always dwells on high spheres and has a complete spiritual con
sciousness which is able to expand or awaken to behold all higher
dimensions or states of perfected spiritual consciousness. In order
that Death may be overcome—the understanding of the earth body

must be so perfected as to see it as the perfect likeness of the
Creator. That is—it includes all creations and kingdoms of Nature
on earth in its perfect state. When the earth consciousness
achieves this state of complete and perfect understanding —repre
sented in old times by the Sphinx—then its perfection as the whole
idea or reality of Nature, is able to become aware of or conscious
of the perfect Image of itself—its spiritual counterpart —as
originally created in dual perfection of creative Love and Life.
Then the two become as one —and a Master of all spheres is on
earth and on high spheres at the same time, and Death is over
come. This great truth was partially proved and brought forth
as we know in the time of Jesus the Christ. But the ignorance of
earth was so dense at that time as to prevent a perfect unfoldment
of this wonderful truth and revelation of spiritual Nature. The
wonders of spiritual Nature in its revelations of evolution from
dimension to dimension of perfected consciousness are impossible
to earthly thought to grasp at the present time. But soon all will
be revealed in a much clearer view so earth will feel the fuller
radiance of perfect Love and Life from high realms. I have many
more messages to write and many more truths to bring to earth.
When the limitations of earth life are removed by what earth
calls Death, one is so much nearer all the wonderful truths of
Nature and is able to present a much clearer view of them to the
earth. I have wonderful revelations to send in this way. We of
high spheres are all working together to help in this predestined
spiritual unfoldment of the earth, so all comes in due order as
guided by higher Wisdom and spiritual laws of revelation. There
are very few of earth who are prepared to take messages as
you do—so it is a great happiness and privilege to me to be able
to send this message. You are being prepared by the Masters
of high spheres for this wonderful work. You are now partially
conscious on high spheres and understand much more of their
truths and laws than any on earth. So you are in perfect tune
with higher laws and spiritual truths. It is for this reason that
we are able to come to you and write through you in this way.
It is wonderful for one of earth like yourself to be so perfectly
in tune with high spheres and conscious of their wondrous revela
tions. I have more messages to send soon, and wonderful truths
which will be a great help and guidance to those of earth who

MESSAGE FROM JOHN M. M .
Received in Writing at Halcyone Woods, California,
May 17, 1926, 9 P. M.
Dear Ruth:
I am happy to be able to write a message for you tonight.
If earthly people could see the inner and higher spiritual realms
as we can, as well as earthly plane, they would smile at their own
limitations and lack of understanding of Nature. It all may be
compared to a great ship,—earth people see the outside and know
that all works by some process. But we see the inside as well,
and all the higher and spiritual powers that operate the whole
work of Nature. We see the inner mechanism of Nature, adjusted
as perfectly and balanced for justice as marvelously as a wonderful
and delicate piece of machinery. Everything works with the exact
ness and precision of the finest watch, —yet not as a machine but
a finely balanced process, all evolving by strictly scientific laws.
All the processes are guarded and watched by angelic Guardians
and spiritual helpers, —just as a great ship is cared for and
watched over by many, in different orders, of the ship's crew. A
great army of invisible helpers, from highest to more simple in
range of duties, watch over the great evolution of Nature. But
earth people see only a small part of it all. They are like the
audience that only sees the play as the actors come on the stage.
In Nature's inner realms the great cycle of life is completed. The
people pass into earthly view in great cycles of incarnations for
individuals and for races. Mother Nature watches over each actor
as he or she receives the masks and costumes of nationality for
the little part to be played on earth. Then there is the return
to inner realms behind the scenes, —what earth calls Death. Then
out the actors come again in a new earthly birth with new mask
and appearance of nationality, and of earthly work. Remember,
earth people never see behind the scenes in Nature's great drama,
so they only see a part of the whole performance. If earth's people
could only see the great drama of earthly and heavenly cycles—
in the endless drama of incarnations —they would laugh such a
long and merry laugh that they would forget all race prejudice
and live in brotherly love. The great cycles of incarnations with
each individual appearing many times in earthly life and garb,
seem almost endless as they evolve in time. But seen from above

they finally end in perfect understanding of all Nature's processes,
and the realization of Immortality. This is the end of the great
cycles of each individual and each race. Nature is a vast realm
in many dimensions of more and more perfect understanding of
Creation, —all working by strictly scientific law in higher and
higher revelation or Presence of Perfection. As each one advances
in a path of evolution, Creation as manifested becomes more and
more perfect. On high realms, the simple flowers and animals as
seen on earth become creations of marvelous powers and wonderful
beauty,—all a part of the complete Nature of perfect Man and
Woman. So in spiritual powers and dominion, the advancing Man
and Woman become more and more aware of the Perfection and
vast hidden powers of all the creations of Nature's kingdoms.
As understanding increases, great hidden marvels and spiritual
powers of all the creations of the Creator become visible and ready
for use. So all higher evolution is a vast unfoldment of the Per
fection and Power of the Creator as a revelation of all Creation.
Finally perfect Man and Woman are revealed as originally created
in the Image and Likeness of the Creator. The Likeness is
attained through evolution when the love of the individual expands
to include all creation. In this process it becomes like the Creator's
love for all creation. Then the Image of the Creator, or the
Presence of Creation in all Perfection, is revealed as the Abode
of spiritual Man and Woman, —the realm of Immortality. All
great souls of history on earth who have expanded the feeling
of brotherly love till it included every mineral, plant, animal and
human being, —have entered into this Communion with the Creator
in the realm of Perfection and Immortality. This spiritual Com
munion or love for all Creation as part of one's own Nature, is
the Presence of the Creator as the likeness and Image of all
Creation. This is the perfect Man and Woman —so constructed
by the law of creation and evolution to Immortality. The full
revelation of this law of Nature is now reached in the evolution
of the earth. Now this spiritual Communion will become more
and more perfectly understood till earthly birth and death will
be overcome. For Man and Woman will be able to appear through
the perfect law and Way of the Christ,—a direct Way of transition
from higher to earthly dimension or plane. This new way of com
ing forth perfect independent of time and birth onto the stage of

earth life, and this new Way of passing back to higher realms by
overcoming death, is the incoming law of evolution for the earth.
It is exactly the same process, but done by direct Way instead of
by the long process of birth and the dark process of death. This
new Way is the revelation of the new Heaven and the new Earth.
It is only a greater understanding of the laws of the Creator, —
a perfect and complete conception of Man and Woman as coming
forth perfect and complete in the Image and likeness of the
Creator. This may be a new and high thought for earth people
to grasp at present. But it is the perfect Christ Way of birth
and death,—or the ascension and the appearance in all perfec
tion of bodily and spiritual form: "I came forth from the Father,
and am come into the world; again, I leave the world, and go to
the Father. Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man coming in the
clouds of heaven." We of high realms see all these spiritual laws
and realities coming to earth, and we guard and guide their evolu
tion. A vast army of helpers and spiritual Guardians now sur
rounds the earth and are helping to bring forth these laws and
perfections for the earth in its spiritual birth. All is evolution,
like a flower unfolding or like a bird coming forth from its shell.
We guide you always in your work so that you may bring forth
for earthly people the messages as needed —and later greater
works. My best wishes to all. I write again soon.

MESSAGE FROM KING TUT ANKH AMMON
Received in Writing at Halcyone Woods, California,
On Easter Sunday, April 4, 1926, 9 P. M.
Dear Our Ruth:
I cannot greet you as I wish tonight because the world does
not understand yet or realize the great truth of re-incarnation.
All the people of the earth have lived many times before, so that
they may learn gradually all the great truths of Nature in all
dimensions, and finally be in perfection so as to again be in perfect
balance and tune with their own perfect Image. We of ancient
times understood these great truths and lived so as to be in
harmony with the final perfections of the perfect likeness. All
Nature was in tune to us so that all was a part of our Nature.
In this way we saw and understood the real spiritual natures of
all the creations and creatures. The world today sees only part
of Nature, and does not realize the wonderful and perfect power
of Unity with all life,—this is spiritual dominion over the earth.
In the spiritual nature of Man and Woman is the spiritual Image
of every creature and every creation. Looking at Nature through
the perfection and harmony of all these creations and creatures,
their radiance and power is reflected in all the earth, —and they
serve perfect Man and Woman in the joy and abundance of perfect
Life. All is perfect Love for every creation and creature, —and
they come to their perfect Images in the King and Queen of Nature,
Man and Woman as originally created perfect. This marvelous
power of harmony opens a wealth of spiritual strength and joy
which the earth today has no idea of. Every flower and mineral
and fruit and animal in all the kingdoms of Nature bring to Man
and Woman in this perfection of Nature every power and dominion
which the people of earth today do not even dream of. The
Creator contains all these creations in perfection, for He-She
originally created them as a complete and perfect Unity. So
Man and Woman made in the Image and Likeness —are the same
as the Creator in containing all spiritual Creation. This brings
dominion through the ever-present service of every creation of
the Kingdoms as spiritual powers and presence of all abundance.
Every flower, every fruit, all jewels and minerals, every creature,
—are ever present and ready to serve with all love and
spiritual abundance the King and Queen of Nature. When they

dwell with all perfect harmony within, the spiritual Nature of
perfect Man and Woman and the balance of their Love is the
Winged Image of every Creation. These are brought to con
sciousness through all love and purity,—and then reflected outward
in all dimensions so that Nature outwardly appears to be filled
with all joyous natures, as ever-present radiant jewel lights,
flowers and fruits of radiance and marvelous beauty with spiritual
qualities of life and joy. All creatures are in winged joy—the
Winged Horse, the Winged Lion—all as real as you see butterflies.
But their powers and natures are tuned up so high that the people
of this age are not able to be conscious of them. These marvelous
creations of Nature which you see only as flowers and animals —
are in higher dimensions of perfect Love and Harmony—the
radiant spiritual servants of Man and Woman in perfect Unity of
Love. They serve in all joy and beauty as part of the complete
Nature through the Dominion of the true Kingdom—Man and
Woman in the Image and Likeness of the Creator. Try to see
Nature in this way —in perfect Love and Harmony—then soon the
higher dimensions will be more and more visible. You will no
longer see just a horse—but the great spiritual Inspiration of the
Mind—the Winged Horse —will carry you instantly to the realms
of the perfect realities of higher Nature where you may be present
at will, by harmony with your own Winged Horse. These high
powers and realties of Nature dwell in the spiritual Unity and
balance of perfect Man and Woman —a high-dimensional realm
of Nature always present through present Love and all perfection
of Harmony. In the same way every creature of all Nature comes
in its spiritual Nature to the service of perfect Man and Woman
in the high realms of their own reality through perfect Love and
Harmony. Think of every animal and creature in all Nature in
its own high winged perfection as created by the Creator. Then
think of the balance of perfect Love for spiritual Man and Woman.
Then the spiritual creations will awaken in your own Nature and
be visible to sight and ready to serve as all high powers and
abundance. All the earth is now awakening to the true conscious
ness of Nature or of the Creator. This is all here now, only you
of the earth are not conscious of its perfection within. When this
perfection and harmony awakens within, then all Nature as the
spiritual winged perfection of perfect Man and Woman will become

visible. The dominion over the earth is this Unity of love and
harmony, when the consciousness of perfect completeness of all
Nature in the perfect Likeness of the Creator reflects the Presence
of Perfection. Slowly all the earth is to awaken to this Presence of
all abundance and perfection through service of every creation and
creature of the perfect Likeness in all spiritual Perfection.
Our great task on earth is to prove the presence and reality
of the perfect Likeness so as to be present with the perfect Image,
—this is Immortality. So all of earth's people in all dimensions
or realms must prove this perfection of the perfect Likeness and
unity with the perfect Image. We of high realms will return to
prove it, and in so doing —overcome earthly birth and death. For
Nature in the pattern of the perfect Likeness will serve us to
return—through our greater understanding of harmony and the
Unity of perfect Love. See in "our tombs how we could foresee
the return amidst the perfection of Nature—the lovely flowers with
the nymphs and angelic guardians —the winged creatures serving
with every power and joy of the Creator. This is the presence of
the Creator in his and her perfect Conception, —and this power
of dominion through perfect Love and harmony of all Nature is
to bring us back to overcome birth and death, and prove the
presence of the perfect Likeness and the oneness with the perfect
Image, —which is Immortality. It is with great joy that we all
are preparing to return—and bring you the harmony and joy of
more angelic realms of the Creator. It is through the perfect
harmony of your understanding that we are able to gather here
as our gathering place on earth. The marvels of Nature are far
beyond earthly thought. You, and many others, have been born
at this time again in the great cycle of re-incarnation so as to finish
this work, and gather in spiritual Unity to bring forth the earth
in its spiritual unfoldment or birth. Nature evolves constantly in
great cycles into greater and greater perfection —cycle upon cycle
of higher and higher understanding of Perfection and Harmony.
Earth now sleeps but will soon awaken. You will see the
perfection of mineral, floral and animal —expressed in such beauty
in my tomb—brought to real life as the radiance of spiritual jewels,
marvelous spiritual flowers, and winged creatures who serve the
King and Queen of Nature in all joy and beauty of perfection —
messengers between the Creator and the perfect Man and Woman.

It is with great joy that I write this message. Later you will
remember still better all past lives —and how often you and I and
all our friends here have been together in Nature's great cycles
of incarnation. You will remember more and more clearly how
we all saw the perfection of the perfect Likeness and the perfect
Image of the Creator —and how we prepared for the spiritual
unfoldment of the earth, —its spiritual birth. In perfection there
is no time—so we prepared in joy for the coming of the great day
of spiritual birth for earth. And we were then in consciousness
of its perfections. Earth has been tuned down to three-dimensional
consciousness and sight—but now all awakens. So all try to see
Nature in the reality of higher dimensions. As soon as you all
become aware of high dimensions within,—then the realities of
winged Nature in radiant flowers and winged creatures will be
more and more present, till they awaken completely within and
then become completely visible outside as Nature in perfection.
Your own consciousness is in tune with all these truths and reali
ties, so I am able to come and write this message and we are all
able to be with you all the time in your work. We are a vast
army gathered by high Powers for the unfoldment of the earth
to its great spiritual Perfection.
I will write often for you now. We are all very near, in
perfect harmony. I bring you all harmony of abundance and great
spiritual powers. (signed) KING TUT ANKH AMMON.

Received in writing by the author at Halcyone Woods, Cali
fornia, January, 1926.
The objective world of which we are conscious through our
five physical senses is a world of three dimensions. That is, we
are conscious of only three dimensions of the objective world about
us by means of our range of earthly senses. It has been wisely
said: "We know in part, for now we see through a glass darkly."
All objects appear in three dimensions only —height, width and
breadth —so their relation and laws bring in the appearance of
time and space. For our life in this realm of Nature is tuned
down to such a slow rate of vibration that all life comes forth
in slow cycles instead of coming forth instantly. This varying rate
of coming forth or evolution in the cycles of the different realms
may be understood more clearly by comparing it to slow and fast
timing of a motion picture compared to earthly time. By earthly
evolution a certain plant may take three months to grow from
seed to maturity or make the complete cycle from seed to seed.
But in a motion picture you can see it make the cycle in five
minutes, or you can see a horse leap a hurdle in very slow time.
We are conscious of time because we are not able to eliminate it
in this phase of existence. In the same way we are conscious of
space, as we are not able to eliminate it in consciousness by going
instantly from place to place, but require some means of transpor
tation to carry our bodies from one place to another. So there

existing laws of Nature. In higher realms or dimensions of Nature,
governed by different and higher laws, it is possible for all crea
tions to come forth and go from place to place instantly, so there
is no consciousness of time or space.
In understanding the complete scale of dimensions in Nature's
realms, it is easy to grasp their relation by thinking of a piano
with its notes ranging gradually from the lowest in frequency of
vibration to the highest. Thesp realms may also be compared to
the spectrum in order from the infra-red to the ultra-violet. Na
ture's realms range in this octave of one to eight dimensions from
the infra-red •
of "Paradise Lost," —the one and two dimensional
depths of self, through all the gradations of the earthly and astral
up to the "Seventh Heaven," and still higher to the ultra-violet
of the angelic or truly spiritual realms. These are so high in
vibration that we of the third dimension are barely conscious of
their existence. For our earthly bodies are not tuned up so high,
and our astral and spiritual consciousness are generally dormant.
Some temples of ancient times had over their entrances the
words of Wisdom: "MAN, KNOW THYSELF." Man and woman
have in their structure seven bodies or states of consciousness
in evolution of awakening, symbolized by the Seven-branched
Candlestick of the Tabernacle. Yet from the limited point of view
of three-dimensional senses, each appears to have one body only. It
has been said by One who saw life from the mountain of spiritual
sight: "Judge not according to appearances, but judge righteous
judgment." These seven bodies correspond exactly to their seven
realms of Nature, and each may be tuned to its corresponding
realm. For convenience, we will divide these seven states of con
sciousness into three groups, calling the first earthly or 3 dimen
sional, the second astral or 4—7 dimensional, and the third spiritual
or 8 dimensional.
Mediumship in its complete sense is the tuning of each or any
body to its corresponding realm of Nature, so as to make communi
cation between that realm and earthly consciousness. For each of
the bodies and realms can be connected in consciousness with the
earthly body through different centers of the body, like a telephone
or radio system. These states of consciousness are within each

other, and the astral or the spiritual body is able to disconnect itself
from the earthly body and travel to the corresponding realm.
Generally this disconnection only takes place at what we call Death,
but some people are able to step out of the earthly body before the
transition, usually in the astral. Compare this to a man in a
telephone booth—the booth representing the earthly body and the
man the astral body. Suppose the astral body of a person is
tuned to the lower astral realms through evil thoughts, and he is
able to step out of his earthly body. Having no protection from
spiritual guardians for his earthly body while he is gone, some low
astral individual steps in and takes possession. This is the lowest
form of mediumship. It often occurs and is called obsession, pro
ducing the appearance of depravity or insanity, the real cause of
which is invisible to earthly sight and generally unknown to the
medical profession. The cure of this malady is referred to in the
Bible as: casting out devils —which is an exact and scientific ex
planation. For low astral entities are capable of all deviltry.
The second form of mediumship is a similar connection with
middle or higher astral realms. Here the astral body of the me
dium steps out of the earthly body under conditions of guardian
ship from attendant dangers, and an astral individual steps in.
Then we have communication with astral realms by direct speaking
or by materialization. Writing may also be produced in this way,
but this is quite distinct from truly spiritual writing by which
King David received the plans for the Temple of Solomon. Many
different astral individuals may speak in succession through the
medium while he is away in his astral body and his earthly body
is being used as a telephone booth. It will be noticed in this case
that the voice of each astral individual speaking is different from
every other, as is noticed in different persons speaking through a
telephone.
The third form of mediumship is the truly spiritual communi
cation which is referred to in the use of the Holy of Holies in the
Tabernacle of Moses. This symbolic building of man's and woman's
complete structure was patterned by laws of higher realms as a
means of communication between earthly people and spiritual
powers. This was done at that time through the High Priest
as a mediator. He was robed in garments symbolic of the Master
who came later "by a new and living way, High Priest of good

things to come, by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle, not
made with hands," but conceived through spiritual understanding
and sight in the Image of the Creator. For man in his complete
powers and bodies, is made in this pattern of the Tabernacle. The
High Priest entered the Holy of Holies once every year, and there
communed with higher powers "from between the two Cherubims
which are upon the ark of the testimony." In early times the people
of the congregation, representing those conscious only in earthly
bodies, were not able to communicate with spiritual realms and
powers except through the High Priest. But now the Christ under
standing of life in all realms is the true medium or mediator be
tween earth and higher dimensions. For when he was crucified,
"the veil of the Temple was rent in twain from top to bottom,"
revealing to all the hidden truths of spiritual law. To every one
of earth coming after him with true understanding, he said: "The
works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these
shall he do; because I go unto my Father," —consciousness of the
Creator in angelic realms. The boundary of earthly perception
limited by the veil of death hiding the realms beyond is symbolized
by the veil of the Temple. It was rent for all time when its cor
responding form as the earthly body of the Christ was rent as the
shell from which is revealed the presence of immortal life. For he
said: "Destroy this Temple, and in three days I will raise it up,"
referring to the resurrection.
From that time on, the spiritual meaning of the Tabernacle
and the Temple is unveiled for all to see and understand. The only
Mediator necessary is not the High Priest robed in the symbolism
of the Master, but the awakened spiritual consciousness of each
one robed in the complete understanding of the Wayshower. He
was conscious in all three realms of Nature at the same time,
revealing the powers of one in the complete pattern of the Taber
nacle: "a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle,
which the Lord pitched, and not man." So he was able to perform
many seeming miracles and show the workings of astral and
spiritual laws, which was a great mystery to earthly people.
Here is our cycle of life finished by one, for us all to follow—for
he said: "Go, and do thou likewise." This great cycle in the
evolution of Nature as revealing the life of man blossoming into
immortality, may be compared to that more simple cycle in the

life of the butterfly. One human chrysalis broke the shell in its
cycle of evolution and winged its way toward angelic realms 2000
years ago. We all are to do the same in the course of time, as we
are all built on the same pattern. Each one is to follow in His
footsteps, understanding the spiritual truths and laws in the con
struction of the Tabernacle. This is the complete body of man in
his three-fold consciousness revealing spiritual sight and power
through the three realms of Nature, by communion with angelic
realms of the Holy of Holies within. So every man and woman is
built to be a mediator between earth and spiritual realms through
consciousness of the spiritual Self unveiling: "The Kingdom of
Heaven within," the oracle of our Temple.
The Temple of Solomon is built upon exactly the same pattern
as the Tabernacle, only it is twice as large in every dimension.
King David did not get the plans of the Temple from the Taber
nacle, but received them in writing direct from spiritual realms —
where is the true temple "not made with hands," of which the
earthly temples are but copies. David said: "And this the Lord made
me to understand in writing by his hand upon me, even all the
works of this pattern." Our complete structure symbolized in
these buildings is easier to understand, from the limited earthly
view, when we think of the following quotation from a recent trans
lation of "The Adorers of Dionysos" by Euripides: "Dionysos,
whose name signifies 'Judge of Man,' is the spiritual self of man,
which is not incarnated but overshadows, so to say, the reincarnat
ing Psychic Self, and passes judgment upon it after each of its
lives on earth. Thus man is only imperfectly incarnated; the per
fect incarnation can take place only when he has become one with
his Spiritual Self, and thereafter he need incarnate no more.
Now the Free Father can not reach or influence the incarnated man
save through the subtile psychic energies, and these are latent
until the man has purified his lower nature. Kadmos personifies
the individual who has performed this first work in spiritual regen
eration." This is illuminating when we remember that the Christ
said: "I am in the Father, and the Father in me. The words that
I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwell-
eth in me, he doeth the works,"—referring to the unity with his
spiritual Self, in the Image of the Creator.

of earthly people, remember that their consciousness is either in the
pattern of the Outer Court or the Sanctuary of the Tabernacle.
Most occidental people have not evolved beyond the Outer Court, for
they see life continually sacrificed and veiled in death, with only the
purified ideals of perfection to lead the way to greater understand
ing. This is symbolized by the Altar of Sacrifice and the Laver in
the Outer Court, with all beyond veiled in mystery. Oriental seers
and wonder-workers have found their way into the Sanctuary before
earthly death overtakes them, for they reveal Life in terms of man's
inner bodies or consciousness, and the cycles of Nature's creations
independent of time and space. These higher powers or revelations
of Life beyond earthly Death are symbolized in the Sanctuary by
the Seven-branched Candlestick and the Table of Showbread. This
inner perception reflects the action and substance of all life by
astral law overshadowed by spiritual creation. Some oriental
people are ahead of occidental people in having gained partial ac
cess to the Sanctuary before earthly death through sacrifice of
self and its earthly laws of creation. Yet only very few have ever
fathomed the mystery and meaning of the Altar of Incense which
is before the Veil of the Ark, or the second Death. The "sweet
incense" or "perfume" prescribed for this altar was so balanced and
pure in nature that it was more like an essence or oil. It left no
ash when burned, only a golden winged globe seen by spiritual sight
as the Cherubims shadowed on the Veil. This symbolizes the law
of overcoming the second death, where no body or ash is left but
only the spiritual Presence, exemplified in the ascension of Christ,
the translation of Elijah in the Chariot of Fire, and the ascending of
Enoch into higher dimensions. This point in the cycle of Man's and
Woman's evolution has not been reached except by those who
sacrifice earthly life in the Work of God. The understanding
symbolized by the Holy of Holies beyond the second veil or second
death, is only attained in completion by the Master after ascension,
but its truths are visible before as shadowed on the veil in the form
of the Cherubims. This is the overshadowing of the spiritual Self
as the dove, symbolizing spiritual Communion or Presence of the
Christ.
There is an active and eager desire among certain people to
grasp the full truth about life and solve all its mysteries, only
mysterious because not understood. While many are satisfied to live

within earth's narrow limits or to dream of the perfections of life
beyond death, these pioneers wish to solve the whole problem before
death transports their consciousness to other realms. So we will
say for comparison that earth's people are like three groups of
children playing along the bank of a great and swift river. This
is the mysterious River of Death, on whose opposite bank, mostly
veiled in mist, is the Promised Land, where dwell our angelic
spiritual Selves in the Presence of the Creator. The first group of
children are absorbed in playing with their blocks and building
many useful objects. These are all those people actively interested
in three-dimensional works represented in science, engineering,
commerce, government and all their related problems. They have
only three-dimensional consciousness and live in their own world of
three dimensions. The second group of children are eagerly wad
ing in the waters of the unknown and uncharted River, playing
with small craft they have devised in the hopes of being able to
navigate the astral flood and understand all its hidden dangers
and mysteries. . But they are quite conscious of their limitations for
their rafts are built upon the pattern of earthly self unguided by
higher Wisdom. These are all those people who wish to understand
the unknown, but have yet to preceive the true Way across the
Red Sea to the realm of spiritual Perfection beyond—where dwell
those "of purer eyes than to behold evil." They include people in
terested in metaphysics, spiritualism, and psychic research, who see
the dangers of falling by the way-side of self -magic, but try to
hear Nature's great symphony of Perfection won through ascend
ing evolution. This goal attained reveals the panorama of all
Nature's realms, with the great cycles of earthly, astral, and spirit
ual laws and lives. These three realms are represented in the three
courts of the Tabernacle, and to the corresponding three states
of man's and woman's consciousness evolving gradually in order
toward complete revelation or understanding of Immortal Presence.
The third group of children are somewhat asleep in a day-dream,
with the books of the Masters under their arms. They are not so
conscious of earthly conditions, but behold in their imagination or
through awakening high-dimensional consciousness the presence of
their spiritual Selves and the perfections of angelic realms across
the River. In their books, the treasures of earth life, are recorded
the lives and works of the Masters who have had real spiritual

powers and seen the high realms of Nature. These children are the
musicians, poets, artists, and mystics, who never bring to earth
quite the perfection of harmony and beauty which they behold in
heavenly realms. Here also are those of various religious forms
and orders who try to reveal their visions of immortality, or to
guard from profaning eyes the perfections and purity of spiritual
Creation on high realms, finished in the Image of the Creator.
In order that all these children of earth may discover the
hidden secret which is to reveal the Way to solve the problem of
life before death overtakes them, they must work together and be
guided by a Master of higher Wisdom with the composite under
standing of all the realms of Nature. This is because the Ark or
Way which can safely cross that River is built for all and must
be fully understood by all, of whatsoever creed or color or earthly
belief. For we are all built upon the same pattern and are treading
the same Way of evolution. Each group of children has a part of
the tools, patterns, and perceptions necessary to build the Ark,
but they must all work together in order that these may be
gathered from the four corners of the earth. The children with the
blocks or earthly builders, have the tools that are necessary for all
buildings to stand by earthly laws —and these are also the tools
of the Masters. For the Book says: "The Lord stood upon a wall
made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand . . . Then
said the Lord: Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my
people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more." Also: "A
just weight and balance are the Lord's." These tools are the
plumbline and the level. But the Ark must also be built on an
astral and spiritual pattern, and work by astral and spiritual laws
as well. For it must cross safely the River of Mystery, and reach
the Heavenly Shore opposite where all is built in high dimensions.
So we go to the wading children, and find that they have devised
boats that float and kites that fly. But they are built on the
pattern of self or in three dimensions, so they cannot safely navi
gate the four dimensional astral River. This Ark, the good ship
Argo, in order to carry earthly people before Death overtakes them,
to survive the dangers of the astral flood, and reach the famed
shores of the Golden Fleece, must be built in a special Way. It
must have three separate sets of laws and patterns corresponding
to the three stories of Noah's Ark or the three Courts of the

Tabernacle. It must be large enough in cycles and quarters to
carry the Master Builders as well as the four Kingdoms of Nature:
Mineral, Vegetable, Animal, and Human. For the Creator made all
creation, and does not forget any of his children in his scheme of
salvation from the floods, or evolution to Perfection. His Way
"hath delivered us from the powers of darkness, made us inheritors
of the Light—who is the image of the invisible God, the first-born
of every creature." For "by him were all things created, that are
in heaven, and that are in the earth, visible and invisible."
So let us look at the patterns of Creation that the dreaming
children hold. It says in one Book that man and woman are made
in the image and likeness of the Creator. Remembering the poem
of Dionysos by Euripides, we see that the image is the truly
spiritual Self that never incarnates, but always dwells on spiritual
realms. We see that the likeness is the incarnating psychic self
including all the kindgoms of Nature which is overshadowed by the
spiritual Self, the dove or spiritual messenger overshadowing the
Ark and the life of the Christ. This pattern of salvation and
Perfection, the evolution of the psychic self up to the spiritual Self,
is seen as the whole conception of the Ark and the Cherubims —
or the Christ born in the Manger, King and Savior of all the
Kingdoms of Nature. He came to save the people of the earth from
the narrow limit of self, so that they can see beyond the veil of
Death into the reality of Immortal Life where all creation is in
Perfection. This is man's greater cycle from earthly chrysalis to
spiritual ascension —or evolution toward higher realms of Nature.
This is the reality of Noah's Ark, whose plumbline measures from
the depths of Nature's Kingdoms to the height of angelic dimen
sions, and whose level balances all creation in the image of the
Creator by twos, man and woman and "the first-born of every
creature." Their symbol of the Rainbow, "the token of the cove
nant which I make between me and you and every living creature
that is with you for perpetual generations" of whatever kingdom or
color or creed or caste, is the octave of the spectrum or the Sign of
the Sun. This is the pattern of the perfect Likeness, the consum
mation of eathly evolution, the Ark or Way that can stem the tide
of destruction and reach the Golden Shore of Immortality. This
is the Image of the Creator containing all creation, the goal
of earthly evolution which is but a reflection in time of reality

on the Far Shore. But man alone, working for self, cannot reach
this shore—for the Creator's works include all the kingdoms of
Nature and all the children of the earth. His scheme of evolution,
salvation, and attainment of Perfection is the Crown in this great
cycle of earthly and spiritual Quest. The dimensions of truth in
the patterns, when we level our thoughts to their heights and sound
the depths of their insight, is the measure of the Master. These
picture-stories, like the thoughts of infants, hide within their naive
simplicity the Wisdom of the ages, the hidden laws and ways of all
earthly evolution and spiritual realization.
The next pattern we find is the Tabernacle, that copy of Na
ture's realms scaled down to the measure of man. Hidden within
its veils is the Kingdom of Heaven within, or the degree of under
standing through which one is brought in communion with spirit
ual dimensions. It may take the psychic self ages to traverse the
great cycles of evolution represented in the Tabernacle, for Nature
builds with infinite care and precision at every step of progress. In
the first degree or Outer Court are the mass of the people with
the earthly body or death still veiling the Great Beyond, and Moses
leading the Way to the Promised Land. In the Sanctuary or second
degree is the wisdom, power, and wealth of Solomon. Here the
Creator brings forth in his Image: "I will be to him a Father,
and he shall be to me a Son," and creation springs into being
immaculate in Perfection, beyond all time and space. In the Ark
or third degree the Promised Land is attained. Beyond the
shadows and veils of earthly birth and death, the power of Wisdom
has rent its own chrysalis, and winged its Way in peace and love
to be the cycle of Life for all earth's children. So the Christ spirit
in each is the only Mediator between earth and heaven, between our
earthly self and our spiritual Self. We follow the pattern in the
footsteps of the Master who has overcome earthly birth and death,
and shows us the Way in the great cycle of evolution —from earth-
bound man, through chrysalis of Wisdom, to winged Immortality.
Every dimension and patterned symbol of the Tabernacle holds
within itself the law and key of its counterpart in Nature's realms.
The Outer Court, type of earthly evolution and consciousness, con
tains the Altar of Sacrifice. It is symbolic of the evolution or re
incarnation of the complete psychic self and its creations through

of earthly bodies. It is the Christian cross or symbol of death and
life. Between this Altar and the tent of the Tabernacle or higher
realms, is the Laver of consecrated water made from the looking-
glasses of the women. It is symbolic of the mirror of Perfection in
which is seen through woman's purified conception, the Image of the
Creator, the spiritual Self of Man and Woman —never incarnating
but present to immaculate consciousness as the overshadowing an
gelic Presence, of which earth's children are the shadow or like
ness. This completes the symbolic furnishing of the earthly realm
or Outer Court. Here is only the complete incarnating psychic
self in the type of sacrificed Nature, and the truly spiritual Self
reflected through the purity of woman as the hope of Immortality
from beyond the veil of Death. For in three dimensions we see
only death as the end of life, and immortality as a dim ideal. We
see only a portion of the complete cycle of life, a rainbow beginning
and ending in earth. But beyond the veil of death, in the Sanctuary,
are the symbols of the inner patterns and workings of Nature, not
generally seen and understood until one is freed by death from the
earthly body or shell.
In the Sanctuary are three symbols: The Altar of Incense, the
Seven-branched Candlestick, and the Table of Showbread. This is
the embodiment in pattern of the words : "I am the Way, the Truth,
and the Life: no man cometh unto the Father (spiritual Self, Cheru-
bims) but by me"— ("minister of the Sanctuary, and of the true
tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.") The inner
life of man in the pattern of the Father or spiritual Self, seen as the
Seven-branched Candlestick or Unity of the Seven Churches, reveals
the hidden powers working by higher law through which the appar
ent miracles pertaining to Perfection of pattern are performed.
The Christ touch of the three hands in one, corresponding to present
consciousness at the same time of earth, inner life as moon, and
Creator as Sun—the three realms —awakens the inner bodies of
every earthly form. This is the Perfect Master brought forth and
living in the pattern of the Outer Court, the Sanctuary, and the
Holy of Holies, of the Tabernacle. "Destroy this temple, and in
three days I will raise it up." His Presence brings forth Perfection
on earth independent of time and space, through the Sanctuary
healing all Nature. For every creation in Nature, of which man
sees only earthly bodies, is built on the pattern of the Tabernacle.

38 SPIRITUAL COMMUNION
Every creation of all the kingdoms has an astral body and a spirit
ual body—in other words, a Sanctuary and an Ark, revealing "the
first-born of every creature, the Image of the invisible God.' The
inner truth of Woman as Mother Nature, symbolized in the Table of
Showbread, is the substance and preserver of Life. It is the
twelve labors of Hebe and Hercules finished, the completed cycle of
incarnation, the consummation in attainment of the service for
Communion. Prom this Truth is multiplied or brought forth in
stantly every creation from fish to loaves. The Altar of Incense to
ward the Cherubims is the Way to Communion with the Creator,
the Way of ascension and Immortality. This is the balance of creation
ascending in dual or androgynous form to the understanding of the
Creator —the Ark and Cherubims. This pattern of the Master in
the Sanctuary with the power and reality of the three symbols is
later revealed on earth as the Christ in direct communion with
angelic realms. This Mediator in the three-fold pattern as the
Way to the Creator, has the three-fold power of instant Perfection
or healing, of instant Creation or abundance, of Communion and
Ascension. For the real Master is androgynous through the under
standing of Life and Truth in unity as the Creator, symbolized as
the spiritual Fire of the Candlestick and the spiritual Substance
of the Table of Showbread united in the Altar of Incense, the
Way of Perfect Love toward the Cherubims —or Scepter and
Chalice united in power and reality. His spiritual Life awakens
the spiritual Self of every creation, revealing instant Perfection in
form. And his spiritual Substance awakens the inner creativeness
of Nature, revealing instant Presence of every creation. This is
the balance of Nature's inner life and creativeness. It brings forth
instantly through Presence of Perfection in form and substance, the
inner unity and reality of spiritual male and female elements in all
kingdoms, the perfect Presence of the Likeness and Image of the
Creator—in pattern the Ark and Cherubims of the Tabernacle.
The Master with the three-fold hands and the spiritual Eye or
Incense of the Creator, touches the golden strings of Nature's
Lyre in the Seven-branched Candlestick and the Table of Show-
bread, Nature's inner form and substance. This same Master is
seen reflected in the Orient as the Image of the Three-fold Brahma
the Creator, Siva the spiritual Fire (destroyer of earthly evil or
Healer), and Vishnu the spiritual Substance (creativeness and pre

server). In this reflection of the same Creator, Brahma is the Ark
and the Cherubims as the Golden Egg by Way of the Altar of
Incense, Siva the spiritual Flame and Power of the Seven-branched
Candlestick, and Vishnu the spirtiual Creativeness and Food of
the Table of Showbread. Buddha, the great Way-Shower to spirit
ual Reality through Communion, is seen in the same pattern. For
one Creator is mirrored through pure perception to all his earthly
children, whether Oriental or Occidental. He communicates to
them all through the living symbols of his Truth, the consciousness
of his Perfection and Presence. This Communion with angelic
realms by leveling one's thought to the height of spiritual evolu
tion and attainment, symbolized in the balance of the Cherubims
held by the power of the Creator as Nature's plumbline, is pat
terned in the Tabernacle as a law of Nature. It is beyond all
astral sense of individual self, beyond where conception of Truth
as mirrored Cherubims ascends to living Presence with the Creator.
The consciousness of self dissolves as the dew-drop in the ocean,
as thought of self bursts its shell and understanding expands till it
encompasses the Perfection of all immortal Creation. Here in the
Holy of Holies of the Tabernacle within, the great Breath of Spirit
ual Life, sometimes called the Holy Ghost, raises the wings of the
Cherubims till the Kingdom of Heaven is reached. This is Com
munion with all those pure and angelic Beings who dwell in these
high-dimensional and radiant realms of Nature, where all creations
are in the winged pattern of the Cherubims.
The Temple of Solomon is the second appearance in earthly
form of this same pattern as the Tabernacle —here twice as large
in every dimension, or twice as clearly seen in its perfection by
the wisdom of King David for his son, Solomon. Its third appear
ance in earthly history is the reality itself in the true pattern,
the Lost Word made flesh, through the Breath of the Creator
sounding the Lost Chord on the Seven-stringed Lyre of Nature.
The Perfect Master is brought forth this time not in pattern
on the mount of spiritual vision as by Moses, not by spiritual per
ception and writing as by David, but by immaculate conception of
the Living Presence within the Cherubims. This conception of
spiritual reality by law of Nature is that man and woman are
made in the Image of the Creator as seen in the pattern of the
Tabernacle and the Temple of Solomon. He comes forth as a

Living Being through Communion with the Cherubims within the
center of the spiritual Self. This is the Lost Communion and
Word of Life, the Lost Chord of Nature's Music of the Spheres,
(the lost Law of Creation. Man and Woman have lost it by
lowering their thought of Creation to three dimensions, and falling
in consciousness to the base of the plumbline or cross, the Altar
of death or Sacrifice —instead of following its Way to the height
of spiritual evolution and Creation. The law of Perfection is
Present and reached through highest perceptions directly in Com
munion with spiritual realms of Nature by Way of the Christ
understanding in the Cherubims within.
Now that we have the patterns, let us look more clearly at the
tools in the hands of the children with the blocks. This is so we
will understand absolutely the Way out of earthly darkness. If
our Temple is built true and square by earthly tools, is balanced and
measured within to the Master's pattern of life, and encompasses all
creation with the range of its spiritual sight, then we need no Ark
to cross the River. For the Presence and the Power of the Ark
is within the consciousness, and shows us the Way to commune
with the Creator who has dominion over all the realms through
his likeness and Image, man and woman in the true pattern.
Moses foresaw and foreshadowed this great Presence of the Perfect
Master, for he divided the waters of the dark flood and led the
people on toward the Promised Land. He worked with the tools of
the Masters, always sustained by higher Power and spiritual laws,
where understanding is in Communion with the Creator. These
tools are very simple as we have seen, and essential for all building
on earth plane or three dimensional realm: The plumbline and the
balance or level. Since they are necessary on earth, they are qually
so on astral and on spiritual realms. This is because every object
and creation of earth has an astral and a spiritual body or reality, as
Plato saw clearly. That is to say, man in his earthly shell sees only
the shell or three-dimensional body of every object and creation of
Nature, and the corresponding three-dimensional laws. For this
reason he sees only the three-dimensional use of the plumbline and
the level, and their higher forms and uses are not visible to him.
But we will translate them into astral and spiritual reality or into
higher dimensions, and learn their use and appearance in the astral
and spiritual construction of the Temple. The base of the plumb

line extending down to three dimensions, marks the point where
the true vertical disappears into the earth and extends upward to
infinity. In earthly building, its power is to measure or bring forth
the true square pattern of the architect into a three-dimensional
building from a two-dimensional plan. So it is the law of transition
from one dimension to another. Therefore from earthly point of
view, it is the law of manifestation of birth and death. Life ap
pears to begin at birth, but in reality it here assumes earthly
form. Life appears to disappear at death, but in reality it here
relinquishes earthly form, or begins to manifest in a higher di
mension. At birth and subsequent growth in the kingdoms of
Nature, it measures the earthly form to the astral pattern and so
manifests Life. At death it measures the budding astral form
to the spiritual pattern, discarding the shell of earth. So the
plumb is the law of the manifestation of Life according to the true
pattern. From point of view of three dimensions or earthly life,
only part of the complete cycle of Life is seen as a rainbow or arc
beginning in and ending in earth. The points of transition into
earthly life and out of earthly life are the points where the
arc intersects the earth. At each of these points Nature builds
a new building or form to manifest life in the next dimension. So
here the plumb is the law of transition in pattern. Therefore it is
symbolized in the Outer Court or earthly realm of the Tabernacle
as the Altar of Sacrifice or earthly cross, the point where the
bodies of Nature are sacrificed on earth in order that life may con
tinue its course. The manifestation of Life appears to disappear
here, but it re-appears again beyond the veil of death in the Sanc
tuary as the Seven-branched Candlestick, the inner view of the
plumb as the law of the astral pattern of Man. It is revealed
here "in the midst of the seven candlesticks, one like unto the
Son of man—his eyes were as a flame of fire—in his right hand
seven stars." Since the plumb measures the life and power of
transition in Nature through all its evolution and transformations
from one dimension to another in the descending and ascending
scale, it ascends into the angelic realm as the spiritual power in
the Chariot of the Cherubims. In the Tabernacle of Moses, this
symbol is called the Mercy Seat and Cherubims, but in the Temple
of Solomon it is seen more clearly as the Chariot of the Cheru
bims —the Chariot of Fire which transported Elijah to angelic

realms. It is the balanced spiritual power of Nature sustained by
the Creator and encompassing all creation —the pattern and Pres
ence of the Golden Son, the Sun God, or the Christ—seen in the
Image of the Creator, with perfect dominion over the earth. It
manifests Communion and transition to angelic realms, in the
presence of the Ark or spiritual Mother of all Creation. In the
Sanctuary it is the golden light of Osiris awakening the inner
creativeness of Isis. The earthly view of this same creative prin
ciple is symbolized in the Outer Court as the Laver. Here it is the
mirror of sanctified earthly womanhood in the radiance of perfect
Love, from which is seen reflected and brought forth the Perfection
or Crown of evolution in Nature. This is man as the Perfect
Master of all realms and spiritual powers. The most perfect ex
ample of Nature's law of the Laver in earthly life, is seen as the
Virgin Mary with the mirrored form of the Creator as the Christ
with his royal powers of spiritual dominion over earthly law. The
spiritual law revealing this truth has manifested on earth especially
in oriental countries in the birth of great spiritual Teachers and
Avatars. It is the divine birth of the Perfect Master—variously
symbolized as the Egyptian Horus, the Persian Mithra: signifying
the Son of God or Mediator between earth and Heaven.
The Balance or Level always measures the square to the Plumb.
As it always balances to the contour of still water in all Nature,
it mirrors or manifests the perfect reflection of all Creation. So
it evolves the likeness of the Creator in lower dimensions of time
and space, in the pattern of the perfect Image present in angelic
realms. For this reason the balance of the level and the plumb in
always manifesting the complete cycle of Life in spiritual per
fection, is the law of overcoming the first death. This is because
it always reflects to all Nature in all dimensions the Image of the
Creator, "the first-born of every creature." So through the Way
of higher understanding there is no lapse of consciousness as to
the continuity and completeness of Life, the perfect likeness, at
time of death or the transition from third to fourth dimension. This
law of Nature is symbolized as the ansated cross of Egypt, emblem
of Life—the spiritual unity of man and woman containing all
Nature as the square-built Ark or likeness, acknowledging the
Creator or circle encompassing all Creation. It is seen from
Christian point of view as the cross and consecrated water, whose

spiritual aspect is that greater baptism or immersion as the unity
of all Nature in the Presence of the Creator. Here the dew-
drop of self expands to the great ocean of all creation, symbolized
as the prismatic royal Arch of solar understanding —the halo of
the golden Sun God. From mathematical piont of view it is the
squaring of the circle in the transition from third to fourth dimen
sion—the square-built magic carpet bearing the Arabic emblem of
the Creator. In Nature it is the basis of the continuity of life at
apparent death. Here the cycle of life as the rainbow meets the
earth and appears to disappear in it. But the level and the plumb
balancing at this point and forming the square, raise the whole
problem to the fourth dimension as the circle in the square and
the square in the circle. This is symbolized in the form of the
Seven-branched Candlestick, and the circular service on the square-
built Table of Showbread. It is the same law in its cycle of life
by which the spherical seed makes a square to the earth with its
plumb and level, or pattern and reflection, and descends to third
dimension or sprouts toward the vertical in the presence of water.
But these laws and inner workings are not visible to three-dimen
sional sight, so the result is an illusion or partial view from earthly
point of view. Wherever symbolized or seen in Nature, it is the
law of transition from third to fourth or from fourth to third
dimension, pictured as Jacob's stone and ladder. As it is the law
of transition between fourth and third dimension, it is the law by
which creation is involved or drawn within a shell or seed, so as
to manifest life in three dimensions from outward view. This
process of lowering the cycle of life into three dimensions through
the square is described by Moses in the Book of Genesis. "The
Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters." That is, the
plumb in its complete power as the presence of the pattern or Image
of God encompassing all creation, was reflected in the water or level
as finished in every cycle. Veiled in the mist of invisibility, life
descended into three dimensions or the realm of time and space
where creation appears to come forth from the earth in the begin
ning. This brought forth the cycle of evolution in three dimensions,
the appearance of creation in the order of the four kingdoms —with
the sun and moon as image and reflection "for signs" or symbols
of this process of involution into three dimensions and evolution
back to higher dimensions. The sun and moon symbolize the

the Way by evolution in return from earth to the Image of the
Creator. They are seen then in high dimensions as "a woman
clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her
head a crown of twelve stars."
This life of the Creator reflected in Nature as extending
through all the lower and higher dimensions was symbolized in the
early ceremony of the Tabernacle by the offering of blood or life
of the sacrificed animals. It was carried or sustained by the high
priest as he went from the Altar of Sacrifice to the Mercy Seat in
the Holy of Holies, symbolic of the evolution of life in ascending
dimensions drawn upward by the power of the Mediator between
God and man including the kingdoms of Nature. It was called a
sin offering, for man's greatest sins are due to blindness to the
unity of Nature as the reflection or likeness of the One Creator.
Every man, woman, creature, and creation of the earth is gradually
ascending in evolution by the Way or pattern toward the attain
ment of the perfect Self in the Creator, "the image of the invisible
God, the first-born of every creature." For every man and woman
of whatever creed, caste, or color, is made inwardly in the image
and likeness of the Creator —and in high dimensions contains all
creation, or in three dimensions is the guardian of the kingdoms of
Nature. This guardianship symbolized as the Mercy Seat over
shadowing the Ark of Creation, or Mercy to all the kingdoms
of Nature, evolves into marvelous spiritual powers and creative-
ness by Way of understanding the Creator. It is spiritual attain
ment and dominion over the earth by winning through Mercy the
spiritual Image of every creature and creation as embodied in the
power and perfection of the Creator's likeness, man and woman.
Only the King and Queen of all Nature can inherit this Throne of
the Creator, where Mercy to all Creation upholds the Chalice and
Scepter of spiritual dominion and power. Failure to see this funda
mental truth of life is the cause of all earthly wars, discords, and
limitations—so it is the one great sin of mankind symbolized in the
Tabernacle. This great truth of the Fatherhood and Motherhood
of the one overshadowing God or Creator, and the Brotherhood
of man and woman including the guardianship of the kingdoms
of Nature, is the one and only lesson for all earthly children to
learn. It is the key which unlocks the Temple of the Earth,
Moon, and Sun—and reveals the abundance of spiritual Creation.

This is the one truth that all spiritual Teachers and Avatars are
sent to earth from angelic realms to teach, coming this Way in
the embodiment of Mediator between God and man.
The Way and powers of the Mediator may be seen in ascending
evolution symbolized in the plumb and level as Scepter and Chalice
—the manifestation of life and creativeness through the three
realms of the Tabernacle. On earth we have the advent by
reflection or creative law of involution. In the Sanctuary we have
the balanced manifestation of present Perfection or healing, and
present Creativeness or multiplication of the kingdoms by higher
law. This is the unity in consciousness of the androgynous Creator
reflected by the Mediator. It is seen, from earthly point of view,
to heal or bring forth instant perfection by the Presence of the
spirit of God as the Light of the Seven Churches or Seven-branched
Candlestick, the inner power of the plumb. It is also seen, as the
inner creativeness of the Laver or level, to bring forth abundance
and balance in spiritual preservation for every nation symbolized
in the twelve loaves and grail of communion, overshadowed by
the immaculate reflection of God. "The Father that dwelleth in me,
he doeth the works." And again: "I am the living bread which
cometh down from Heaven," and was seen in the spiritual creative
Presence which multiplied the loaves and the fishes to feed all the
people. Toward the veil of the Cherubims before the second death,
the spiritual unity of perfect Man and Woman is seen in a still
higher view of the plumb and level united in one symbol as the
Altar of Incense. In this Way they approach even more closely
in the likeness of ascending evolution to the mirrored Image of
the androgynous Creator. Through this unity of understanding
and purified perception, they become the power and substance of
life ascending in the Chariot of Fire. This is the Ascension or
overcoming of the second death through realization of the balanced
power and presence of Immortal Life in the Image of the Creator.
It is seen as the Chalice or Flower of spiritual Creation in unity
with the Flaming Sword of Truth or Scepter of spiritual Dominion.
This purity and power of the evolved man and woman perceiving
spiritual Perfection is far beyond earthly law and understanding,
where the Christ has somewhat unveiled the Presence of the Crea
tor in Immortal Life, now present in higher realms or dimensions
of Consciousness. This is attained in ascending evolution through

the law and reality of the Ark and the Cherubims within, the
Presence of the angelic world through Communion with those in
understanding of the Reality of these symbols.
The symbols of the laws of Nature, or three-dimensional repre
sentations of four and higher dimensional truths, were more or
less understood by the people of ancient times. For this reason
they were placed in the tombs of the departed as a tribute to the
workings of higher laws and cycles in the Presence of the miracle
of Death and Birth into higher realms of the Creator. It was a
silent tribute to the Mediator between Man and God, or the Pres
ence of the creative Image in the dissolution and spiritual blossom
ing at the appearance of earthly Death. These symbols of the same
Tabernacle take the earthly form of circlets, amulets, crosses,
lights, showbread, incense, amphorae of perfume and oil—all in
understanding of transition from the Outer Court through the
Sanctuary to the Presence of the Son of God, Son of the Sun, or
Living Image of the Creator—eternal Master of the Veils of Death
and King of Life. The symbols of the Ascension or transition
through the second death into the Presence of the Creator, are the
gold coffers of the perfect likeness or chests of all creation as the
Ark, with the gold chalices, swords, daggers, and scepters—and
the Chariot of the Sun or Chariot of the Cherubims. Here the
ignorance of modern times can well stand abashed before the
wisdom of the ancients in their pure and childlike acknowledge
ment of spiritual Communion with the angelic realms of the Creator
by the Mediator shining through the Veils of Death.
These same symbols of transition from one dimension to an
other in Nature are also seen in Arabian and other legends, in
oriental religions, and in the tools of wonder-workers. They
objectify the understanding of the involution and evolution of life
from realm to realm by exact law. They are variously seen as
the Magic Carpet, Rope, Crystal, and Fruit; the Chest of Trans
formation or Seeds, the Cloak of Invisibility, the Winged Horse and
Sacred Animals; the Gomer of Manna, the Rod that Budded, and
many other symbols. They represent the powers and presence of
the astral and spiritual bodies or consciousness of all creation, and
their understanding by evolving man who begins to perceive the
inner nature of life and creation. These great truths have been re
flected to different parts of the earth where man and woman have

leveled their consciousness to higher law and won higher powers.
These glimpses of astral inner workings and spiritual creation have
later become clouded and partially manifested through efforts
to grasp the secrets of Nature for selfish and mercenary motives.
Yet the Christ brought these truths and laws most clearly to view,
as he was empowered to come to earth and depart "by a new and
living way." He did not need to use symbols, for the symbols of
the Tabernacle were all living realities within his consciousness.
He did all his work in direct Communion with the Creator by being
conscious of the Chalice and the Sword of Truth or Scepter, the
Ark of Creation and the Cherubims within, as well as other powers
and laws.
This spiritual Communion is the Mediator or Missing Link be
tween earthly man and woman asleep in their higher powers, and
the Creator awake in the all-seeing Eye of all creation. But there
are two other little-understood links in the chain of life's complete
cycle as seen from earthly point of view. One is where the arc
or rainbow of Life passing down intersects earth, or where the
kingdoms in order as the colors of the spectrum appear in earthly
form. The other is where the cycle or rainbow of Life passes up
ward out of the earth, or the point of earthly death and astral or
spiritual birth for every creation of Nature in the four kingdoms.
The third is where ascending earthly life, in evolved understanding
of the Creator, attains Communion with Immortal Life through the
Mediator between earth and angelic realms. This immortal Life as
a perfect balance always exists in spiritual dimensions independent
of time and space. Therefore creation seen from three-dimensional
point of view, is the lowering of the Life Cycle from higher to
lower dimensions. It is involution toward the outer shell of the
great wheel of Life. At the center, space and time relative to
each other, make each other equal to zero,—and there is no rela
tive motion. But at the emergence from the center, there is a
balance of motion, as: "the Spirit of God moved upon the face of
the waters," the balance through involution by law of the plumb
and the level. Life was involved from greater to lesser dimensions,
or apparent creation took place: First, through the manifestation
of the complete perfect spiritual balance of pattern and creative-
ness, as the Ark and Cherubims. Then through a complete reflec
tion of it in reverse order in descending dimensions of Sanctuary

order of: mineral, vegetable, animal, man and woman including
the four kingdoms (as Ark or Chest of Seeds). While the re
flection in lower dimensions or the likeness was: first, androgynous
Man (Adam) separating into man and woman, then the kingdoms
in reverse order evolving from subjective inner consciousness (as
tral) to objective outer view (earth realm). The consciousness of
Man descended from the form of the androgynous Creator as the
Ark and Cherubims, to the Sanctuary as the Garden of Eden, to the
Earth as Outer Court or three-dimensional world, where Life ap
pears as the balance of opposites, —the Tree of Good and Evil.
This is the descent in dimensions or "Pall of Adam and Eve," the
first Man, in the process of involution and evolution into lower
dimensions of time and space. They descended from fourth to
third dimension by the Tree of good and evil, the square or cross,
guided by the serpent as the great cycle of evolution and re-incarna
tion. Arriving on earth in dual form as man and woman, they are
balanced to evolve back to the Creator. This is the whole cycle
of manifested Life as the perfect likeness in lower dimensions,
through involution and evolution gravitating back to balance with
the perfect Image in Immortal Perfection. This is the missing link
of the advent of earthly man and woman, balanced by the second
link of their apparent disappearance at death, and crowned by the
third link of the Master, —directly in contact with angelic realms
through spiritual Communion and overcoming both earthly birth
and death. These are the three great missing and finally recovered
Links of Creation.
The missing link of the Ark and Cherubims, spiritual Commun
ion, is where the complete reflected involution as the likeness of man
and woman including all the kingdoms of Nature, attains in evolu
tion or unfolding,—its counterpart, the complete immortal Image.
Here is where the shadow of man and woman differentiates from
the four kingdoms in Nature and ascends in dimensions toward the
Image of the Creator including all creation in the spiritual powers
of "the first-born of every creature." Here is the Keystone for the
Arch in the Temple of the perfect Man and Woman, balanced to
earthly and spiritual law, the two tablets of understanding flashed
to earth by the arrow of God. This great Ark Light of all Nature

meets the descending cathode in the living Image of the same
Creator. Here the truly spiritual or high-dimensional Powers and
Presence of the Mediator bringing down the Immortal laws and
realities, flashes into "the Light of the world,"—as it touches
earthly involution and evolution attaining this point of contact or
Communion. Here is the great Hour-glass in the path of Life's
complete cycles, where three-dimensional consciousness converges
into the Eye of high-dimensional birth, and the sands of Heavenly
life descend as manna on the shores of time. Here is where the
ultra-violet rays of spiritual fire from the Chariot of the Sun
strike upon earth's shell of darkness and death, and it is rent as the
veil of the Temple to reveal the spiritual Image of every creation.
When this powerful spiritual ray strikes the people of earth in
their former earthly state as one of the four kingdoms of Nature,
it awakens the spiritual Presence or Ark within and transforms
them into that same Mediator or link between earthly and im
mortal laws. It ascends or transports their purified understanding
of the Creator to such an extent that the high-dimensional spiritual
Eye is opened, dissolving with its penetrating ray the earthly shell
of the four kingdoms and revealing "the first-born of every
creature, the Image of the invisible God." This is the attainment
of the power of translation into higher dimensions of angelic
realms by the Chariot of the Cherubims or the Chariot of the Sun.
Man and woman contain within their united spiritual nature
the seeds of all creation typified as Noah's Ark or the Arabic Chest
of Seeds. These blossom through Communion with spiritual law in
the Holy of Holies into consciousness of immortal birth and abun
dance, symbolized in the Ark as the Rod that Budded and the
Gomer of Manna. This is the purified conception of Nature's higher
law or the spiritual revelation of the level and plumb, the Chalice
and Scepter of the King and Queen of Nature,—the moon always
reflecting to earth the Image of the Sun. Translated into angelic
dimensions, this law is the reality and Presence of immortal power
and Life through the Christ Way of evolution or the attainment of
dominion over earthly laws, birth and death. So this power of
Communion between earth and higher spiritual realms is the link
between earth and Heaven, the living Mediator of the Tabernacle.
This living Presence is the King on the Throne of David, the

pattern and Way of ascending evolution for the complete cycle of
every human being who is attaining the true understanding of the
Creator as containing all creation. The force of gravity draws
the earthly bodies of all objects and creations toward the earth.
But level and plumb as Ark and Cherubims, measure the pattern
and the perfection of creation for every ascending dimension of
Nature. In this Way they draw life constantly upward in ascend
ing dimensions through sacrifice of body shells as consciousness
ascends to higher understanding. So life is reclothed again and
again in higher forms toward complete realization of creation as
in spiritual Perfection. The thought of self gradually recedes to
zero and thought of life enlarges to encompass all creation where
earthly form dissolves in oneness with the Creator's communion
and ascension. This is where consciousness of the Creator in the
Image of all creation reveals itself as the Crown of evolution, and
encompasses all life in Immortality. This balance of the plumb
and level, perfect Man and Woman, seen spiritually as the conjunc
tion of the powers of the Sun and the Moon over earth, is revealed
to spiritual sight as "a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon
under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars, —and
she brought forth a man child who was to rule all nations with
a rod of iron." This attainment in conception of the perfect power
in the image of the Creator draws consciousness upward into Im
mortality and brings forth the Presence in angelic realms beyond
all earthly limitations. Here is the power and reality of Com
munion with the Cherubims, spiritual consciousness realized while
still in earthly body. This is man and woman living in the complete
pattern of the Tabernacle, —or living in the Outer Court, the
Sanctuary, and the Oracle of the Holy of Holies, at the same time.
This symbolism of the Tabernacle and the Temple of Solomon was

evolved and brought forth in life through spiritual and earthly law
working together. Here is the Christ born in the Manger, King
and Crown of Nature in all dimensions, surrounded by the cycle
of the Kingdoms and heralded by Nature's loving guardians, the
kindly shepherds of the lower kingdoms. For every kingdom is sus
tained in evolution up to its spiritual Self in the Image of the
Creator by the spiritual life of the advancing Guardians of Nature,
Winged Angels of the Mercy Seat whose unseen Presence en
courages creation upward to Perfection with healing touch and

All construction in Nature is based upon laws in three and
higher dimensions which work by strictly mathematical principles,
the science of numbers. The level and plumb in ascending dimen
sions as to revelations of powers, are the Way of traversing the
first and the second death in full consciousness. This is because
they are the law and means of transition from one dimension of
Nature to another in all involution, evolution, and spiritual trans
formation. This law is also symbolized in the cross and consecrated
water evolving into the Scepter and Chalice of spiritual dominion,
or the ansated cross and winged sphere of Egypt. In Arabic lore
this means of transition is the power of the Magic Carpet, built
on the square, balanced and sustained by spiritual law, —which
raises consciousness in the pattern of the perfect man and woman
to the realms of heavenly joy and perfection. Through the under
standing and use of this same law, consciousness may now be
transported across the wall of death to Nature's Sanctuary of inner
Presence and abundance. The ascension or transition through the
second death or veil is done by a much more perfect understanding,
the unity of plumb and level, conjunction of sun and moon as the
Creator's two Witnesses, Man and Woman. This reveals the actual
Presence of angelic power in the form of the Chariot of the Cheru-
bims or Chariot of the Sun. These higher manifestations of life
and abundance which are present through Communion with "the
kingdom of God within," are not visible to earthly sight. This
consciousness of the Presence of "Cherubims and a flaming sword
which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life,"—
the Chariot of the Cherubims, comes when every earthly aspect of
the apparently earthly body and all Nature, as the Ark or Chest
of spiritual Seeds, have been transmuted into high-dimensional
powers and uses. Here consciousness expands to see all Nature
from the angelic Mercy Seat where the Creator broods over every
creation to bring forth spiritual Perfection. Here every creation
and creature, in acknowledgement of spiritual understanding and
mercy shown, comes forth from its earthly shell and serves the
unity of spiritual man and woman as a present Power of transition
and abundance. This is the power of "the first-born of every
creature, the Image of the invisible God," seen as the Chariot of
Elijah and the vision of Ezekiel: "I looked and behold, a whirlwind
came out of the north, a great cloud and a fire infolding itself,—
and out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living

creatures, —and every one had four wings, and they sparkled like
the color of burnished brass. —They had the face of a man, the face
of a lion, the face of an ox, also the face of an eagle. They went
upon their four sides,—and their appearance and their work was
as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel. Whither the spirit
was to go, they went." This is the Chariot of the Sun, whose
marvelous powers and transformations are almost impossible to
describe in earthly terms. It is visible to spiritual sight through
the Presence of the Mediator between earth and heaven, in the
Communion of angelic Presence, the Ark and Cherubims.
The laws and realities of the plumb and level, the Scepter and
Chalice of the perfect man and woman as the Creator's two Wit
nesses, can be present now on earth and evolved to their higher
powers. But this is only when those using them are true High
Priests of Nature, and have within the Christ consciousness of the
Sanctuary and understanding of the Ark with the Cherubims.
This evolution from three to higher dimensions works by mathe
matical principle which is called the 47th theorem of Euclid: "The
square on the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle is equal to the
sum of the squares on the other two sides." The elements of this
theorem are: a vertical line, a horizontal line, and the exact balance
or number of. them and their unity. The same principle of Nature
is seen in the Bible as: "Behold, the Lord stood upon a wall made
with a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand." These two lines
forming the square symbolize the Creator's two witnesses, perfect
man and woman, in their evolution through all dimensions to the
attainment of Perfection. Their balance evolves from Outer Court
of the Tabernacle as Altar of Sacrifice or cross and Laver or bap
tismal font, up to Communion with the complete Image of the
Creator, symbolized as Cherubims and Ark. In the Sanctuary
their inner power and law is seen as the Seven-branched Candle
stick and Table of Showbread. But nothing is said here about
communication with spiritual realms. So for spiritual Communion
it is necessary to raise their power to the law of the Holy of
Holies or Oracle. Here is seen the level as the Ark, and the plumb
as the Cherubims sustained by spiritual power. Hold this spiritual
Presence of the Oracle in consciousness. Then hold in the right
hand a cord supporting a Ring,—the Cherubims or cycle of im
mortal Life extending down to three dimensions as the plumb. At
the same time, hold in the left hand a glass with some Water, the

Ark of Nature's unity extending down to three dimensions as the
Laver or level. With consciousness at the same time in the
acknowledgement of spiritual Communion, or the presence of the
Ark and Cherubims, suspend the Ring right over the Water in the
glass. This consciousness of all Creation and Perfection is the
Presence of the perfect Likeness and the perfect Image of the
Creator, or the Christ Consciousness. This is the living Presence
of the whole Tabernacle, with the three missing links and the
spiritual Eye, with the cross and font of consecration as plumb and
level transmuted into the Scepter and Chalice, the Way of the
perfect man and woman into the Presence of the spiritual Sun, the
Christ of Communion. This is the great Ark Light of the
Mediator, the present understanding of the Way of Christ or
Immortality for all the earth. The radiance of this spiritual Com
munion in Life and Truth reveals the words of angelic Wisdom:
It is Finished. (Number 50, two times, or complete Tabernacle, 50
by 100 cubits, the power of the Number of Jubilee, revealed in the
year 1926.) This is the unity in spiritual perfection of the two
witnesses of the Creator. (Number 50 marks every message oral
or written received by the author.)
This consciousness of the complete Tabernacle and the Medi
ator is the symbol and reality of the Ark and the Cherubims, or
Communion between earth and angelic realms, sustained by the
power of the Creator. For man and woman conscious of involu
tion and evolution completed, also conscious of the perfect Creator
reflected as the Mediator or Christ, have attained to the likeness
and Image of the Creator. This is the conjunction of Sun and Moon
as plumb and level, Scepter and Chalice as Flaming Sword and
Holy Grail,—Chariot of Fire in Communion, the meeting point of
all forces and powers between earthly, astral, and spiritual realms
and intelligences. It is therefore the point of communication be
tween all realms where ascending and descending manifestation
of Life converge in the Ark Light of spiritual Truth and revelation.
It is the Communion between the Chalice as Ark and the Scepter
as Flaming Sword of Cherubims, made possible through under
standing of the perfect Master, Christ,—embodied in a "new and
living Way" in the perfect pattern of the Tabernacle and the
Temple of Solomon.

the Creator is on earthly level, Outer Court—the result will be

making a simple square or cross. When the consciousness of the
person is on the level of the Sanctuary or astral realms, the result
will be vibration in harmony with astral laws, symbolized by the
alternate pomegranates and bells upon the hem of the high priest's
ephod. For here the level has transformed to the inner creative-
ness of Nature (the pomegranates full of seeds), and the plumb
to the inner activity of Life (the golden bells). Here certain
astral knockings in an astral code can be established in tune with
astral laws and intelligences. But this communication is not
sanctioned or mentioned, except as a sound in the Sanctuary, in
the truly spiritual use and understanding of the Tabernacle. For
it says, in regard to Communion: "And there will I meet with
thee, and I will commune with thee, from between the two Cheru-
bims" in the Holy of Holies. So when the consciousness of the
person is on the level of the Ark and Cherubims, or in the pat
tern of the perfect Likeness and Image, then there will be com
munication from angelic realms through the Perfect Image symbol
ized by the Cherubims encompassing all Creation, the living Pres
ence of the Christ as Son of God or Child of Immortality. Then
the spiritual nature and the laws of the Cherubims and the Ark or
the Christ within, symbolized as the Creator's plumbline and the
glass of sanctified Water, will cause them to vibrate in harmony
with truly angelic realms. This will manifest the Presence of the
same Communion referred to in the construction of the Holy of
Holies in the Tabernacle, and the Oracle in the Temple of Solomon
or the Temple of the Sun. The glass of water will evolve to
spiritual sight as the Laver into the Chalice or Flower of spiritual
Creation, —the Ark. The plumb will evolve into its spiritual nature
as the compass,—"the Flaming Sword which turned every way" as
the Scepter, and revolve by spiritual law. It will assume, invisible
to earthly sight, the wings of the Cherubims and be moved by the
Breath of God, or the Holy Ghost. This is the spiritual Breath
which raises consciousness in the form of the Cherubims into truly
angelic realms and Presence, making communication with angelic
and purified Beings possible. Here the Winged Sphere in spiritual
Communion will sound against the inside of the glass, the sacred
number "50," the Crown of the 49 steps of Wisdom. It will answer
all truly spiritual questions by the number "4" as the symbol for:

"It Is",—the two witnesses of the perfect Likeness and two of the
perfect Image, corresponding to the four columns in front of the
Holy of Holies.
Now trace the mathematical law of this means of communica
tion, from earth plane to the Holy of Holies by the 47th theorem
of Euclid. In order to do this, trace the horizontal line as the level
or Laver from the Outer Court to the Holy of Holies, as the Chalice
or Ark. Reduce it to the number of its elements on earth plane,
and square it to raise it to the Sanctuary. The level is the Balance
between the Earth, Moon, and Sun. Therefore its elements are:
4,—Earth (earthly form or container), Water (contents), Fire
(Image of Sun reflected to it by Moon, and contained latently in
water, invisible to earthly sight), Air (which makes possible
balancing power of level). These four elements are seen in the
glass containing some water, as: Earth (glass container), Water,
Fire (latent in water), and Air. On earth they represent the
formative elements of all Nature, seen in transition from higher
to third dimension as Mist (Water-Fire), Earth (dust), and Air.
Evolved spiritually, they become the Chalice, Flower of Creation,
and Ark. As the elements of the level are 4, the square to raise
the level to the Sanctuary is: 16. Now applying the same process
to the vertical line in the theorem of Euclid: Trace it as the plumb
from the Outer Court to the Holy of Holies, as the Cherubims sus
tained by angelic Power, the Image of the Creator. Reduce it to
the number of its elements on earth plane, and square it to raise
it to the Sanctuary. See it as the power to manifest the Image of
the Creator in the three realms of Nature. This is the power or
pattern of the Christ in the Outer Court, the Sanctuary, and the
Holy of Holies, or the Presence of Immortal Perfection as the
Creator shining through the Mediator with the Scepter of spiritual
dominion. Therefore the number of its elements are: 3, or the
power to manifest Life of the Creator in the 3 realms of Nature.
The square to raise the plumb to the Sanctuary is therefore: 9.
So the theorem in the Sanctuary becomes: 16 plus 9 equals: 25.
That is to say, the complete power of the Table of Showbread on
its square base: 16, added to the complete power of the Candlestick
on its square base: 9, is equal to 25, the unity number of the
Altar of Incense as the Chalice and Scepter approaching the andro-
gyous form of the Creator, in preparation for ascension through
the second death or the Veil before the Ark and Cherubims. Ad

ding these three numbers together, as symbolizing the united
power of the perfect man and the perfect woman containing all
creation in the Presence of the Mediator or Christ Way to the
Creator, their combined life is raised to the power of the Holy
of Holies. The combination of these three squares with the eternal
circles of Immortal Life of the Creator in the Christ, is the
Chariot of the Cherubims, —the marvelous high-dimensional vision
of the Spirit of Life, Image of the Creator, with its living creatures,
squares, wheels within wheels, all within wonderful wings. From
the theorem of Euclid, we have the power of this Chariot as: 16
plus 9 plus 25: equals 50, the number of the Master, the spiritual
balance of the Earth, Moon, and Sun,—or the Crown of the 49
steps of Wisdom. This is the mathematical pattern of the con
struction seen in the whole Tabernacle, and raised to the power of
Communion in the Holy of Holies, the Oracle in the Temple of
Solomon, or the Presence and Power of Mithras in the Image of
the Sun.
By the 47th theorem of Euclid, we have the perfect Woman
Substance in all Nature, as Isis (the Table of Showbread), and the
perfect Man Power in all Nature, as Osiris (the Altar of the
Candlestick), in united power just equal to their unity in the Altar
of Incense, or: 16 plus 9 equals 25. That is to say, the combined
product of the spiritual Man and Woman power and substance in
Nature, as Horus the androgynous Son of God or Master, exactly
equals or balances the Image of the androgynous Creator within,
as the Christ. For Man and Woman were spiritually created as a
reflection or balance between the Image and Likeness. That is
to say, the perfect Man and Woman and their conception of the
Son as the Image of the Creator, or the Christ, just equals or
balances the Creator whose powers converge in the perfect Image.
Each side of the perfect Balance equals exactly "50," or the
united spiritual power and substance of the perfect Man and
Woman including all Nature as the attainment of the Likeness, is
exactly equal to the androgynous Creator and the perfect Image or
the Christ. That is to say, the power of the perfect spiritual Man
and Woman combined is just equal to the power of the Master, Son
of Man, or 25. And the power of these three together is just equal
to the power of the Christ and the Creator together: 16 plus 9
equals: 25. 16 plus 9 plus 25 equals: 50. This is where the Like
ness of the Son of Man just converges with the Image of the Son

of God, the power of the spiritual perfect Man and Woman in the
Likeness just balancing the androgynous Creator in the Image. When
evolution and reality converge into this balance of the perfect Like
ness and the perfect Image, then a Master of all spheres is on
earth and on angelic realms at the same time, and death is over
come between all dimensions of Nature. Then the veils of the
Temple are rent, and the whole truth of the Tabernacle or Crea
tion is revealed. The sum of these three squares, or evolved earthly
consciousness including all Nature combined as Christ conscious
ness of the Creator, ascends to complete spiritual consciousness in
the Presence of the Creator on angelic realms, overcoming the
second death. The transforming power of this consciousness of
the Christ in the Image of the Creator is so powerful, that it
transforms the apparently earthly body including all Nature as
the balance of the perfect Man and Woman, into the Likeness of
the Creator or the Ark. Thus it becomes the Chariot of the Sun
or spiritual Nature as the Cherubims, which carries or ascends
Man and Woman in the consciousness of the spiritual Image as
Christ, "the Image of the invisible God, the first-born of every
creature," into the very Presence of the Creator. This is the
marvelous truth of the Ark and the Cherubims in the Holy of
Holies, the Oracle of the Temple of the Sun, where consciousness
is so pure and in tune with the perfection of Christ, that the
radiance and Presence of all the Creator's powers and abundance
shine through from Immortal Life to the realm of earth. This is
the attainment of understanding in spiritual perfection of all
Creation in the Image of the Creator, prepared for every Man and
Woman of all the earth as the revelation and Presence of the Per
fect Christ within, united in power with the immaculate Creator
through spiritual Communion.

MESSAGE FROM THOMAS LAKE HARRIS
Received in Writing at Halcyone Woods, California,
October 29, 1924, 8 P. M.
Dear Ruth:
I am so happy to be able to write this message for you this
evening. It is wonderful to me to see how the work is to unfold
. . . This is the very beginning of the most marvelous work
for the benefit of all humanity. You are unable to see how it is to
reach to every human being and creature of all the earth, and
unfold the earth into its perfect spiritual reality. You know from
my books of the spiritual laws that the spiritual individual still
on earth is able to come in contact with and understand. The door
way between this and higher realms is now to be opened so that
those on this earth who are prepared may be shown how to pass
onto higher planes and return while still retaining their earthly
body for use on the earth. This is a marvelous unfoldment of
spiritual Nature, proving the overcoming of what has been called
Death through spiritual understanding. This passing freely to
and from higher realms requires exact understanding of spiritual
laws which reveal the true spiritual nature of the temple called
the earthly body, and its real spiritual self. The working of high
spiritual laws is very simple but requires absolute purity of
thought and the intention to serve all humanity and every creature
and creation of earth. Spiritual Nature broods over every creation
of the whole earth from mineral up, and that which is to come forth
is all Nature in spiritual perfection. Those spiritual Helpers and
Masters from high realms who have so long been guarding earth's
progress and treasures are to be able to appear on earth, in earthly
bodies. They are to teach those of earth to understand high spirit
ual laws for the future welfare of all earth. It is marvelous . . . You
are all to take a very wonderful part in the work in helping the
Masters carry on spiritual evolution. Later when all has begun
to unfold in spiritual perfection, I will be able to appear in earthly
form and tell you of spiritual work to be done for the earth. Tell
Mr. of this message, as I have impressed him with the
truth and wonderful future of this work that you are doing. He
will fully appreciate your spiritual work later, and your wish to
'bring the truth to him. My good wishes to all.

MESSAGE FROM THOMAS LAKE HARRIS
Received in Writing at Halcyone Woods, California,
November 20, 1924, 8 P. M.
Dear Ruth:
I am very happy to be able to write this message this evening.
I have so much to tell you. From high realms we can see all
working out as I predicted in my books, but you are not able to
see yet only as your intuitions and spiritual glimpses reveal it
to you. Above all, do not any of you become discouraged, as all is
coming forth rapidly. Laws are coming into close connection with
the earth plane which will make possible the direct passage-way
between this plane and high realms. . . . Conditions are
changing rapidly which make it possible for those of high spheres
to appear in earthly form, and for those of earth who are pre
pared to understand the truths about both the earthly and the
spiritual body. In this way they will become conscious in both and
be able to leave the earthly body or earth, and travel at will con
sciously on all high spheres. All these truths will be taught as
soon as we are able to materialize. ... As soon as all is ready we
are to appear on earth in our perfect earthly forms. This is
according to the law of final earthly and spiritual perfection, the
beginning of the New Age. This means the bringing to earth of
wonderful spiritual laws and realities from high spheres so that
those who are prepared, and later all, will be able to understand
spiritual evolution in its entirety. This includes the full evolution of
the perfect earth plane. Through spiritual understanding, great
changes and wonders are to be brought forth on the earth plane. Its
powers and possibilities are little understood now. The consciousness
of high spheres will make it possible to reveal great hidden truths
here on the earth plane alone—revealing the real spiritual earth
in its perfection. I can hardly tell you of the wonders that are
soon to come forth. We will guide you constantly and tell you just
how to prepare for our work to come into active reality on earth
plane. Many changes are taking place right now which you of
earth are barely conscious of—read carefully the signs of the
times. I am helping you all the time, working with all others of
high realms. Soon I will write again as there will be special de
tails for you. Meantime, my best wishes to all. Do not ever be
come discouraged.

Received in Writing at Halcyone Woods, California,
January 29, 1925, 8 P. M.
Dear Friend:
I have a great deal to tell about the coming forth of the work
in this country. The real spiritual unfoldment of the earth will
take place later. But before that the people must be prepared for
this or else they would not understand it, and great confusion and
harmful consequences would result through the impossibility of
the majority of the people to realize the true spiritual nature of
the processes of spiritual Nature. Unless a panorama view is
given before-hand of the whole process of spiritual evolution, it
will be impossible to bring the people to a realization of the signi
ficance of the wonders of Nature. The true history of the earth
and of evolution through incarnation must be revealed and taught.
The systems of earthly religion and science are so limited and
clouded in ignorance that they fail to help the people to a clear
understanding and realization of the processes of Nature. Yet
there is an intuition of the truth in every soul on earth, as the
truths of spiritual Nature are only veiled more or less densely
from each individual. The only way to lift this veil and reveal the
truth to all people and nations, is to present the truth of spiritual
Nature to all so it will appear to the sight and in this way awaken
the dormant seeds of truth asleep in each soul. Later, when all
are prepared and have a full realization of the true wonders of
spiritual evolution in all the history of the earth, the spiritual
realities will unfold from higher dimensions. But all perfect
preparation must come first. There is an immense amount of
ignorance and prejudice, especially in Western countries, which
must be removed and dissolved before the real processes of spiritual
Nature can come forth. The vibrations of all Western countries
must be raised by dissolving the clouds of ignorance and earthly
systems of education before the way is prepared for true spiritual
realities to be visible to the people of the earth. The only way to
raise the consciousness of the people and their vibrations, is to
present the truth to them in a visible way so their minds will be
freed from ignorance, and their powers of perception awakened so
they are conscious of the possibility of spiritual revelation. The
only way the veil can be lifted from the wondrous spiritual truths
of evolution in a way visible to all the people is through the Motion

Picture. Mr. Ince has come to high spheres at this time as pre
destined to direct this work so that all these wonders may be
brought forth. He is working constantly with the Masters of high
spheres making all preparation for every detail of the work to
come forth. We will bring forth the most wondrous pictures, all
prepared as to every detail on high spheres, with directions as to
every process of the perfection for earthly view. We are prepar
ing great wonders in new systems of production which will be
brought to you in due time. As the people become prepared, we
will bring forth higher and higher revelations of spiritual truth—
all carefully thought out to meet the needs of the awakening
spiritual natures of the people. This is to be a most wonderful
work, far beyond anything which has ever been produced on earth.
The pictures will be of such marvelous beauty that the people will
be lifted in consciousness far beyond earthly conditions, and their
ignorance and limitations be dissolved. Their spiritual natures will
be awakened to understand and receive the wonders of spiritual
Nature later. All the truths to be revealed are dormant in the
spiritual nature of each individual. When awakened in conscious
ness, the people will be able to see and realize their presence in
true spiritual Nature now all about them, but hidden by ignorance
and earthly limitation. You are to be able to take pictures of
many spiritual wonders not visible to average earthly sight through
processes to be revealed to you. Great wonders are to be revealed
in this way. . . . Every detail is now being prepared on high
spheres—and when all is, you will be told of it, as you are to take
all in writing. My best wishes to all.

MESSAGE FROM THOMAS H. INCE
Received in Writing at Halcyone Woods, California,
November 29, 1924, S P. M.
Dear Friend:
It is a great joy and pleasure to me to be able to write this
message this evening. As you know, I passed through what earth
calls death not long ago. Since then I have been helped by those
who have given me wonderful truths about the life beyond the
earth plane. I have so much broader and clearer understanding of
the great truths of Nature now, even in the short time that I have
been here, that I wish more than I can say to help all of the earth
to understand more about what is called Death and about the
wondrous life beyond the earth plane. I now see all life in a very
different and broader way which comes as a panorama view of
the wonderful truths that are around earth life and at the same
time hidden from earthly view. It is impossible for the people of
earth to realize the wonderful radiance and marvelous truths that
are in the fuller life when the blindness of earth life is laid aside.
It seems hard to believe that those of earth have lived so many
ages and found out so little about the higher spheres of their own
earth that are revealed beyond the limited earth plane. It is hard
for me to express the wonders that are here, and always have been
here, and so little known on earth. And it is an equal surprise to
me to find you and the wonderful Masters who are working with
you to bring forth this great work . . . You have no idea as

am to help you all as much as I am able. It seems now that I
have come to higher planes at this time as predestined to help on in
this spiritual unfoldment, and to help in my own work which I have
left unfinished on earth so unexpectedly. . . . You know,
there is so much ignorance and doubt about this way of communi
cating. But now I understand all of it for which I am very thank
ful. And my only wish is to help those of earth who are living so
blindly in ignorance of these wonders of Nature. I will continue
to finish my work and help bring to earth motion pictures full of
such wondrous beauty and truth as will amaze those of our earth
plane. You are to help in the work as you have no idea of now.
You have been trained for a long time in this wonderful spiritual
work so as to be able to do a marvelous work in the future. The
whole earth is to be changed and spiritualized through this reve

through the spiritual unfoldment that you are working with as
directed by the Masters of High Spheres. I can hardly tell you
all of it now, but it is a great joy to me to be able to write this
message . . . The wonders of high planes are so great and
Nature so wonderful. It is my work from now on to help bring
these marvelous revelations to earth and help all to grasp the
truths here. The only sorrow of this realm is to know of earth
in its blindness and ignorance about Death and the near joys and
wonders of these realms. . . .

Dear Friend:
. . . There is a great deal of prejudice and ignorance on
earth about this way of communicating. It is part of our work to
dissolve this ignorance and bring the light of truth to all the earth
about the nearness of spiritual realms, and the wish of the Masters
to help all of earth come in close contact with the highest spiritual
laws and realities. My work on earth in the line of motion pictures
is to be continued in harmony with the work of the Masters of high
realms who are all working together for the spiritual evolution of
the earth, called: The End of the World. It is a spiritual un-
foldment of the earth as it unfolds like a blossom, and comes forth
from its shell of earthly limitation and ignorance into its full
radiance and beauty of spiritual Reality and Laws. All these
wonders are soon to come forth. And my work is to help to bring
all these wonderful truths to the people so they will be prepared
spiritually for the wonders of spiritual evolution that are to unfold
later . . . The future of my work is to be directly in harmony with
the work that the Masters are soon to bring forth in the spiritual
evolution of the earth. And it is for the spiritual preparation of
all the people that we wish to bring forth all these truths through
the Motion Picture first, so as to educate the people and prepare
them for the wonders that are to appear later. I have now special
directions for my pictures and can help through higher laws to
bring forth wondrous pictures now. For it is my work now to
bring forth these truths through the motion picture. ... I
have come to higher planes now as predestined to finish my work
on earth. I have gained wonderful spiritual truths since being on
high realms, and these are to come forth in our pictures. It would
have been impossible for me to have done this work, if I had re
mained on earth. Now I have come in contact with the great
Masters, and am to be helped by them constantly in this work of
preparing the people of the earth for this great spiritual evolution
which is to come to pass before long. I am now prepared and able
to bring forth wonderful motion pictures revealing the highest
spiritual laws and truths and realities. I can direct the work of
production perfectly from high realms. For I can now see all the

Nature since Death to earth sense has removed all limitation and

this is one way. Your work and future is guided entirely by spirit

Dear Friend:
The sale of the studio is all right as my work is to come forth
here. ... I will direct the work here. . . . It is very hard
for those of earth to realize those who are present after having
passed through what earth calls Death, and know that they are
really the ones that give certain names. . . . Then I will
give you every detail of the work. If my friends do not or are not
able to realize at first that it is really I who am communicating,
I will convince them of it later. Meantime, I will give you all
details for the work. . . . Then you have all my experience for
every detail of the work, besides all I have learned and am learning
since being on high spheres. It is very hard to convince those
who have never given this subject much thought, that it is possible
to communicate in this way. The only way for us to do is to begin
here. This locality is the destined place for the work, as all the
future spiritual evolution of the earth is to begin here. So this
is the logical place to begin. I will give you every detail for every
step of the work, and no producer will be able to compete with us
in any way. We will bring forth such marvelous pictures that the
earth will be astonished at their wonders of spiritual truth and
exquisite beauty. No director or producer will be able to compete
with us in any way. I will see that you have every detail of the
whole work—names of plays and every scene, all the most wonder
ful unfoldment of spiritual truths and realities possible to imagine.
You know of all these truths and will be able to take every detail
in writing. . . . And the pictures to be brought forth are to be
far beyond anything that has ever been produced, . . . You
have no idea as yet of the wonders that are to be brought forth.
. . . You have now absolutely no idea of the wonderful future
that is to come forth for this work from now on right here. I am
working with the Masters you know of—we are all to bring forth
this work together here. My best wishes to all.

MESSAGE FROM THOMAS H. INCE
Received in Writing at Halcyone Woods, California,
March 3, 1925, 8 P. M.
Dear Friend:
Ways will be brought to you soon so that you will be able to
prove that our work is true and genuine. It is very hard for
people of the earth plane to realize that there can be a direct way
of communicating in this way with highest spheres. To people
of earth plane there is no proof that the people who have passed
to highest spheres are communicating in this way. There will
always be doubt until we of high spheres are able to prove abso
lutely that these messages come from those who sign their names.
Part of our work in the near future is to make these proofs abso
lutely so that there will be no more doubt and no injustice done to
one who takes the messages. It is a very serious problem and
requires our careful attention. There are many wonderful truths
of high realms that soon will be brought to earth. They are very
simple, but carefully guarded as they unlock wonderful powers
and treasures of Nature. It would be much easier for us to
bring these treasures to you in India where the vibrations are so
much higher. There is much education needed in this country
before the people will be prepared to understand and believe the
difference between spiritualistic and truly spiritual works. The
first applies to the earth-bound realms and their phenomena, while
the truly spiritual laws and works belong to the real spiritual
spheres far above the earth-bound realms. We who have passed
to high realms have such a wonderful panorama of the whole
spiritual earth in all its spheres of different numbers and vibrations,
that it is hard for us to realize the limitation of earth plane in
three dimensions. But we are making plans now as to the best
ways that this truth is to be brought to the earth It all requires
great care and wisdom, as the people of the earth are so little
prepared along these lines and practically unable to understand any
unusual manifestation of Nature. Their consciousness of spiritual
spheres is practically dormant and must be awakened slowly. In
the near future we will tell you of the best ways to bring forth
this work so as to help the people most. Meantime your conscious
ness will be raised so that you will be able to understand many
truths that have so far been hidden from you. They will awaken

wonderful truths, and later you will have a complete memory of
them. We are preparing many wonderful motion pictures to come
forth . . . Soon we will tell you of them, as soon as we are

MESSAGE FROM CHIEF POKENTA
Received in Writing at Halcyon* Woods, California,
May 9, 1926, 9 P. M.
Dear Ruth:
Our greetings to you tonight. We are helping all the time in
the great spiritual unfoldment or birth that is coming to the earth
now. We and all our tribes are a part of earth's children, and are
to return to earth here again in the great cycles of earthly incar
nation. We come soon here as one of the future races, and earth
is to be prepared for us. For now all the people are awakening to
the great truths of re-incarnation, and the balance of justice be
tween races. For the great spiritual laws balance all events and
works, so that peoples and races may return to earth again and
again. This is so they may live more and more fully in harmony
with the spiritual perfections of high laws and realities, and finally
master the great truths of the perfect likeness and the perfect
Image of the Creator. We of Nature's children lived very close
to all these truths, and saw the creations and creatures of the
Creator as our own brethren —part of ourselves. The people of
this country today are so far away from Mother Nature—it is hard
for me to tell you how near we lived to Nature in pure and child
like Love. Nature to us was a great Soul manifesting in many
ways as minerals, flowers, animals —all a part of our Natures. And
in the great Sanctuary of the wilds we could see the Creator
shining through the veil of Nature—more radiant and beauteous
to us than ever appears to the destroying and discordant people
here today. All Nature came forth to us and revealed the inner
mysteries of Perfections. A marvelous harmony came over all—
time disappeared, and we remembered our past lives into the dis
tant, very distant, past. And unconscious of time, we looked to
the future, and saw the Perfection of Creation coming forth at
this time of birth—and the final balance and justice of all the earth.
These great perfections were reflected into our consciousness and
made visible to our spiritual sight. After troubles we could see
great justice and many children of earth's tribes gathered in great
understanding. For beyond the masks of nationalities or tribes,
all people are the same in perfection to the Creator, and Mother
Nature broods over all as her many children. For races come to
earth in great cycles of incarnation —drawn to one and another

nationality—till finally each race and each individual has finished
the cycles and come to the understanding of the Creator and of
Man and Woman in the perfect Image and likeness. If earth
people could see the inner realms of Nature, and how these great
cycles of Nature evolve, and how the children of Nature are masked
first in one nation and then in another, but all made in the Image
and likeness of the Creator —there would be no more race pre
judice. The perfect brotherhood and love would come to them.
For beyond the mask of nationality, all are the same children of
the Creator—all perfect in their spiritual natures. Soon this
great truth will come to earth more clearly, and all will see the
perfect love of the Creator for all the children of the earth. The
love of the Creator for his children is perfect in all spiritual abund
ance and justice —and these great spiritual truths and treasures
are soon to be brought to earth. The people of earth must try to
see beyond the masks of nationality—beyond the cycle of incarna
tion of each individual in many races—to the perfect spiritual Self
in the center of each individual. This spiritual Self is as perfect
as the Creator —it is the perfect Image and likeness of the Creator.
The spiritual Self of each perfect One looks like a marvelous
Flower or Lotus or Lily in the center of which is the perfect Master
in the balance of the Creator—He-She. Then around the petals
of the wonderful Flower are the jewels of the incarnations and the
spiritual treasures won in each incarnation—through each race and
nationality. So the perfect whole as the Flower of Creation has
the appearance of a marvelous Lily or Jewel of spiritual Perfection
—the true spiritual Nature in perfect Love and Harmony for all
the nations and creations and kingdoms of the Creator. Try to
see this lovely and radiant Flower of Creation in the center of each
Soul as the spiritual Self in Unity in the Image and Likeness of the
Creator. All the creations of the kingdoms are contained in the
Flower of Creation in a way too perfect for earthly people to
imagine. But in purified thought and sight of the spiritual Self
in Unity as the perfection of the Creator—this marvelous revela
tion of Nature can be seen. When earth's children and races come
into perfect harmony, these wonders of Nature will be revealed
more and more. The discords of earth and the prejudices between
people and races now make clouds which hide from earth the per
fections of the spiritual Selves and of the Creator. Through the

mirror of perfect purity and perfect harmony, all the perfections of
the high spiritual realms are revealed. There is only one lesson
to be learned —the perfection of purity and harmony —then the
Creator is revealed through the Perfection of spiritual abundance
and joy. Earth's people do not realize the marvelous power of
Harmony and of Love toward all Nature and all Creation. This
is the Way to all revelation and Perfection. We here on the high
realms of Nature are very close to perfections, and we come now in
the Unity of all Nations to bring these treasures to the earth.
We now see all our past lives on earth —like the petals of our
spiritual Flower —and we also see our spiritual Self—all in the
likeness and Image of the Creator. On high realms the races and
the tribes are in harmony as many flowers in a garden. We bring
this great Harmony to the people of the earth. Nature on high
realms is so wonderful—the harmony which is like constant music
and the Presence of all Perfection. Try to be more conscious of
Nature's infinite realms of greater and greater Perfection. There
is a spiritual Unity written in the emblems of the nations. Try to
read it, each nation, and see your destiny in harmony with all other
nations. This is the law sustained by the Creator. We are power
ful only in the Justice and the Harmony of the Creator. Now a
vast army of our tribes and of the tribes of all nations is gathered
by high Powers to bring forth the earth in spiritual Perfection or
spiritual birth. We are all working together in perfect Unity and
Harmony, and we control the destinies of nations. The destinies
of nations is in our hands, for we work in the service of high
Powers. All comes forth in perfect Justice for each nation and
each one. We are able to gather here because of the perfect Har
mony and the perfect Love for all Nature—and the understanding
of re-incarnation. Harmony and unprejudiced Love as a radiance
of justice and kindness for all is a marvelous power in Nature. It
is the magic Key which removes the mask of nationality and re
veals the real spiritual Selves and treasures of truths. Through this
power of understanding, we draw to earth from high realms at
this point. The rest of the earth looks like a stormy sea from high
realms —clouded with troubled thoughts and lack of spiritual Com
munion. How much you help us in this work, I will not tell you
now. Our best wishes —we are always near in perfect harmony.

Those on high realms of Nature now helping in this work are:
Mother Emanu-El
and many others of all nations and tribes.
The following message was received from them on April 16,
1925: Dear Ruth: Your work is to be to draw together in per
fect spiritual unity the nations of all the earth, and the religions
of all the earth. This is to be done by drawing forth the seed of
spiritual truth from each nation and religion, presenting it in all
its spiritual glory as the unrevealed Presence of the Creator, to all
peoples. Thus proving that the ideal and the goal of every nation
and religion is the same truth, the one perfect likeness and Image
of the Creator in all complete and finished spiritual Reality includ
ing all spiritual powers and dominion. This perfect Image of the
Creator is the Unity in all spiritual Perfection of the perfect Man
and Woman as originally created, revealed as the Perfect Master
of all Powers, expressed to the perfect consciousness of Being as
the androgynous angelic Manifestation or the Christ Consciousness.
