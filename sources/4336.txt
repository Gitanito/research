    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Quarterly Celestial Philosopher, The.
 Or, the Complete Arcana of Astro-Philosophy: Commencing with Genethliology Simplified, or the Philosophy of the Doctrine of Nativities.  Also The Astro-Meteorologist.
 1844--1849  Quarterly
 London, England.  Publisher: Simpkin, Marshall and Co..  Editor: W.J. (William Joseph) Simmonite, A.M., M.B.A., Ph. Mat. / M.M.S., M.U.S..

 1/1, 1844-1849.  21 numbers.  1 s. an issue, 16 postage stamps a year.  Simmonite (1809-1863) was a polymath, probably impecunious, trying to get by in a harsh world.  In the late 1830s he ran a Classical, Mathematical, and Commercial Academy in Coalpit Lane in Sheffield, offering an "English Education" to youth of both sexes, and followed this up in 1841 with a Practical Self-Teaching Grammar of the English Language (1841), and Medical Botany (1848).  His real interest, which he was largely prohibited from practicing by the laws of the time, was astrology, especially horary astrology and "astro-meteorology."  He published ephemeris from 1838 on, and a complex series of journals and series on astrology, principally designed to simplify and explain astrology.   BL
