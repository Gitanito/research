 The volumes for September 5, 1925-January 1, 1927 are titled Spiritual Era.    This is one of the few purely spiritualist journals of the period and is a good example of the sad decay of the movement in the twentieth century.  It provided platitudinous commentary on the spirits, a "Mediums' Directory," and "Reports of Societies," but the result lacks energy and is padded out with recipes and other general material.
