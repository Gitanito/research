that is, of th fundamentals of the Kindergarten System.
Of cour h re are a great many featm s of the Kind r-
garten ystem which are not Phr nogarten, whi h ar not
truly kindergarten ; that is, a great deal of teaching is im-
part d; but a true Kindergarten yst m would be the ap-
pli ation of t a •hiug only in an indire mann r.
The valu, of any syst m consists in its infl.u nee upon the
evolution of the fa ulti s of the mind, and does not depend
upon th impartation o£ tmy assumed facts. In other words,
popular ducation, which is the teaching of b m mory, is
altogether wrong. We require a ystem of education which
will aim d.ir ctly and primarily at the evolution of the
faculti and employ teaching only a a m ans to that nd.
If the pupil comes out of school with a well d v loped mind,
it do s not make any differen e whether he knows anything
or not. He does not n d to know anything if he ha a mind
that will nabl him to :find out things, and with a properly
d v loped mind he will 1 arn anything that he ·wants to.
Th refore, in our ystem we aim not at tea hin(J' th pupil
things but at d v loping hi mind o that h will be able
to learn whatever h wants to after bjs period of education
i ov r. The conventional syst m aims at the sup1 lying the
pupil with au elaborate fund of knowl dgc while be i going
to school, and its m to be based upon the idea that · soon
as h g ts out from under th school mast r' rod h is not
goiug to study he will not r ad anything, he i not oing
to tudy aJ1ything, therefore, all that he ev r ]mows must
be beat into him while be i going to school · that if you do
not make him know all tho e thin s, h will u v r know
them, and o you mu t give bim as gr at a fund of knowledge
as po sible while he is in s hool.
ow, the school hould not b inteJJded to t ach him any-
thing. It bould not be d sigu d that the pupil should learn
anything whil · he is iu school. H hould go there :for the
pul'pos of developin(J' his brain aud, through that, hi m ntal
faculties and wh n be is turn d out o chool h hould b a

tion of botanical process , of th process s of growth. The
term m ans lit raUy "Mind Garden. ' It is tb garden in
which mind· ar cul livated anu the ordinary prin iples of
gard ning just as we woul apply them in the cultivation
of plants, are appli cl in the Pb1· uo..,.arten m thod.
Wbat are the pri ciples embodied in the cultivation of
plants in the garden 1 V\T U, we plant the seed, or, in oth r
words employ involution. Then we supply thi seed with
soil, wat r an nnshln and other lements and tb cllem-
ical n sary to d v lop that eed to the high st degr e of
p rfection. By cultivation, we keep the groun in the b t
pos ible shape for be r alization of that result. Likewi. e,
by ultivation we remove from it verything that will inter-
fere with the highe t perfection of that plant, surrounding
th plant, in other 1vord , with th most p rfect environment
possible and when w hav accompli bed his, we wait for it
to unfold and it always do s so. Luther urbank. in his
system of plant work has mploy d tb se principles. He
ha realized what he wanted to accompli h. 'rhen he has
taken plants, planting them in the proper way so as to give
the best possible results; then smrounded them with the
most favorable envil·onm nt po ible to bring out all of those
attribute which he desir d. In the arne way w hould
sunound the child with th environment suitable for bring-
ing out the highest perfection in bis fa ulties. We . hould
r alize that the entire o j ct of our training is to call out
the faculti s so that they will be unfolded will be dev loped
to the high t degree of perfection. To do this we should
b ar in mind the Lamar k an doctri_u o..E evolution by u .
We ·bouJd realize hat all g1·owth clep nds upon exercise;
that the d velopment of the faculties are dependent upon
the amount of exercise which they get. In order to d velop
a faculty, tb ·refore give it exercise. That is the only thing
that is necessary, and the only value there is in the regular
school of education is in its utility as a m ans of giving exer-
cise o the mind; in other words, it is of value only as a
syst m of mental gymnastics, and in no oth r way.
When you t ach a pupil, yom· teaching benefits him in
act proportion as he bas to think in order to understand.

If you make things so plain tbat it doe not requir any
thought on his part to compreb nd them it i of ab olutely
no value. It is fo this rea on that many progr s ive
t acher do not work problems for th ir pupils at all, will
not work them, but make the pupils continue to work on
until tb y find th olution th mselves and thu they are
developing their faculty of calculation. Of cour , the
teachers do not realize till , nev rthele , they ar doing it,
and ar cons quently, d riving a great d al of b n fit from
it, which they would not d rive if the ordinary method were
employ d. The exerci es that are employed in education
are us d as a mean of calling out this activity of the facul-
ti s which leads unto their dev lopment.
row, it should be borne in mind hat ach faculty of the
mind functions through a defini e organ of the brain.
Phr nology give the key to all m ntal activities and oper-
ations. t i only as we study Phrenology that we ru:e able
to understand the operation of the mind. Each faculty o£
the mind ha a c rtain vibratory rate. .All the thoughts
whi h are operativ in that dir ction that i , which go to
m.a.ke up tha faculty, vibra e on a c rtain g neral scale or
vibratory chord o to sp ak ow, tbe result i , in order for
tho thought to com into manife tation that is for th e
mental impulses to xpress thcmselv s through thought vi-

must be me ph •sical m d.ium tb.ronah whi h tb y may
op raf · that i. to say th r mu t be a. part f th brain
uffi ienUy s nsitive and al o sufficiently k en to this rate of
vibration hat it will respond to such vibration and to no

d v lop d organs in tb brain, suitable to their manifesta-

and thus will allow tho e faculties to manif st. Tlris is
really th genesis of the functional area of the brain.

the power of thought. Likewise, the fu1ene of thought,

of h brain fibre, and th brain cell , and b th refining of
the thinking we refine the brain cell and fibre.
In the third pia e it should be borne in mind that we
can manifest our mental impulse in the fotm of thought
only by havincr brain cell keyed to that specific vibratory
rate appertaining to that thought, cons quently, a thought
can n cr manife t it lf until we have d v lope a brain
cellular combination and a fibre adapt d o th mani£ ta-

to xpre. s more thought we d v lop a gr ater numb r of

.All th s fa tor ar to b taken into con id ration.
The Pbr nogart n ystem is in brief, the application of
what v 'r method will most surely result in be evolution of
the .fa ulti s. We rnn t impart our instruction, not for the
pw·pos of tea bing anything, but for the purpose of giving
xcr ise to the faculty that \Ve want to dev lop, and give the
exercise at the prop r time and in the prop r mann r.
We should also bear in mind the importance of the law
o£ p ri dicity in the mental d v lopment, as well as in
v rything l e. W should realize that it is xercis of the
.faculty which counts and that i really the redemption of
our entir system of ducation. If it were not for the
mental gymnn. tic , th pupil g ts in school hjs whole life
would be a failure be au , it sho :tld be borne in mind that
nine out of cv ry ten of our fa ts are absolutely untrue and

only r 'dcmption is in the excrci e which ibe mind g ts so

B ar in miud, ih n, that while the conventional system will

t ft h tb pu il what l1 ought to know, the Phrenogarten
y t m will cJ velop in him the capacity for thought. It i
no a syst m f teaching, but a y ·tern of du ation; that is,
a system of uniolding tb latent powers of mind, and there
is no limit to th capacity for such unfoldm nt, neither is
th re any limit to the e ' tent to which tbe pupil may unfold.
n this method we, tb refore, give ex rcise to the faculty.
That is the um and substance of the hrenogarten System
- ive exercis to the faculty, and give it in the proper
manner and to the faculty that you want to dev lop.
'l'his yst m could never be systematically appli d until
Phrenology had become a science, but through Phrenology
it is now po sible to d v lop th mind in any way we want
to, to any d gree we wish.
Mental evolution i made pos ibl by the application of
these rational methods to the thinking ru1d also to the physi-
cal organ itself. Ev ry f ature of the Phrenogarten ystem,
is therefore, a means of applying the law of growth and evolu-
tion to the Phrene organs of tb brain in their development,
o that they will be fitt d as fit v bicles ru1d in trumonts for
the ex.-pre ·ion and activity of tb ir eorr ~:;ponding mental
faculti s and likemse for the d velopment of th mental
faculties by their excrci e in ord r bat bey may be properly
developed and may xpr s themselves brough their cor-
responding Phr n rgans in the orr ·ponding tal nt,
g nius, prodigy, mental power, etc., which must nece sarily
follow their particular degree of unfoldment.

By Tal ut we m an tho special mental pow rs which are

them, in a en e above the g n rality of the human family.
Th sp ial capacity for fitn due to pecial mental
developm nt we t rm a Talent.
The Talents ar ab olutely neces ary to fit one for the
higher walk of life, to fit on for exerci ing he more im-
portant fun tion that may be pre ented in human d v lop-

that on ha a mind adapted to the performanc of certain
fun tion whil anoth r lack that sp cial functional adapta-

he may hav a numb r of tal nt . It doe not follow that

Talents may b itb r inh rited or acquired by tudy.
Many p r ons ar born with them; oth r acquir them in
the ours of tim ; in fa t, it is th purpo of a true educa-
tion to impart to th pupil a many talent as po ible, or
as ar conv nient. But the bing w want to under tand at
thi tim i the e n e of tal nt; what i i that imparts to
diff r nt talents. It hould b borne in mind that
force in the world which pacifically adapt them-

of th nivei L divid d into a number of the e cla
having a g n rnl vibratory tone and as it vibrat in this
way it mu t proclu in the individual mind the same p

ion of th inC!ividual mind to mbody and manife t he
univ rsal mind. It can do his only to the degree that it is
adapted to r pond to that univer al mind.
Now the cliff rent talent in the individual mind represent
the orr .ponding qualities and attributes of the universal
mind; that. is to say, tho e a pect of th univer ·al mind
which bave a common rat of vibration hrough the cbarac-
ri tics, or ratb r activities of he individual minds having
the same general vibratory hord. Thu , the talents that
arc mani.fe ed in be univer al mind are m r ly the in-
dividualization of the orresponding Grac s and 1\iu es of
tl1 unhersal mind.
A more simple statem nt of the problem would perhaps
be that the Iaculti s of the indhridual mind ar al o pre ent
in tb universal mind and a the faculty in th individual
mind becom sufficiently developed to enabl the ttniver al
mind to manifest it. elf through i with ea and con nience,

faculty becomes a talent. Th difference then, betwe n the
tal nt faculties and the ordinary fa ulti i mer ly a dif-
fer n of d-gree; the talent is be pecial fitnes for a thing
which a p cial development of the fa ulty give . In the
ordinary faculty w may go ahead and perform thi ftmc-
tion tbe same as we can any other function but when thi
faculty ha become ufficiently developed to impar a talent
for this thing, it becomes ea y and natural for us to perform
it. It do s not require any p cial effort of the will to ex r-
i e it; w do not plod any longer, but go ab ad and act
e sily and natm·ally. The .force which i a o oncentrated

That faculty, mind you, is a propensity toward a rtain

It should b borne in mind howev r, that there i a dif-
fer nc b twe n Tal nt and Propen ity. Th y are both the
product of fa ulty d velopment, but the propen ity is the
inclination the thiTst after this particular line of activi y;
it i the d ire for it, th appetit which grow out of th
habitual whirl, or habitual direction of the wbil'l and ha i ual
tone. Tal nt, on th other hand, is the capacity, the power
which is d v lop d by rea. on of the following o · the propen-
sity. Propensity is what timulates one to do; Tal nt i
the abili y to perform wh n thus stimulated. Prop nsity i
desire; Talent is capacity for action.
The educational ystem in common us , quite oft n d velops
a considerabl degr e of Talent, but it does it by r a on of
the stimulation of tho whirls the noel ization of that par-
ticular tone in the vibration of the Mana and con quently
in the d v lopment, thl'ough xer i e, of the faculty. Ex-
erci e of a faculty must always tend to its development and
consequently to the production of its talent. We see, con-
sequently, that as a result of the conventional sy tem of
19
THE PHRENOGARTEN SY TEM F EDU ATION
education, talents have been acquir d on a numb r of oc-
casions, but th ir acquisition has been accidental. No effort
has be n mad to acqwr thos tal nt , they have b en the
r ul of th xerci which was ecured ju t a a man by
manual labor acqui.r s certain kill in doing rtain things,
though b has not tried to acquire it. In the same way,
people inherit the tal nt of th ir parent , or by procrea-
tive infiu nc , etc. We ee this operating all th ' ay through
in the entire law of natural 1 ction, but what they have
n v r attempted has b en to sy t matically d velop those
talent . ow, the Phrenogart n ystem of Education pro-
poses to go about it to d velop the Talents in a y t rna ic
manner. This i wherein our ystem differs so much from
the conventional system. The Phr norrarten ystem o Edu-
cation does not aim at t achin<Y thing , but at supplying
talent and thu it ha the same relation to the other sy tern
that pbysi al culture bas to work or that an appr nticeship
bas to ordinary labor. We cxercis a faculty for U1 specific
purpo of dev loping it corr ponding tal nt.
By the Phr nogart n method, therefore, the pupil will
make u e of any m thod which will tend to timulate the
activity of a c rtain faculty; that is, which will cau e the
production of tho e whirls in the Mana along a certain tone
and thu will d v lop the faculty and it corre ponding
or an, so that the talent growing out of th high develop-
ment of that faculty and organ, will be prodn ed; and the
natur and aim of the Phrenogarten method is the sy tematic
development of talent. That i what we aim. at, and the
entire cou1 e of education i a cours of Tal nt Training and
th r is no limit to the extent to which the talents may be
dev lop d. The law b ing fundamental mployinrr the
fundamental principl s of nature, it therefore follows that we
are able to develop the talents to any degr e that we may
wi h. ot only this, but we can develop all th faculti s of
the brain if we so desire, o that they will furnish their cor-
responding talents. We may have th universal talent in-
stead o£ merely certain individual kind , on or two or a
few at most. In fact, the brain may become the vehicle for
th manif tation of th entir rfahat to the point of the
high t po ibl talents. However, it should be borne in
20

mind that it is not pos ible for man to d v lop all his talent

Genius is fonnd on1y where a faculty is develop d o that it
acts by rea on of its own momentum, irrespective of any

in the univ r . i no longer takin"' the initiativ ; be is
no lon<r r doin"' thing but is rather, the channel hrough
which 1he Kosmic forces operate. It is in thi way th·Lt it
act intu.itivel , :!'or i i intuition in r ality; w p ak of
it a b ing immediate igbt or imm dinte cognition of truth

it ou ; we do not follow any rea oning processe in order
to r ach truth; it come to u instantaneou ly, illuminating
our on ption.
Now, what do we mean by thi statement? Well, in the
first place we mu t understand what r ally take· plac , in
our p rc ption of fac . Wh n we see an obje t, the eth ric
vibration from that object have, in r ality, pen rated om
Aura, awak niug corr sponding vibrations there which have
pa ed to the c nt r of consciou nes , and by rea on of a
duplication of tho e vibrations, we become con cions of the
object. It is in this way that we perceive objects, that we hea1·
sounds and ev rything of that kind. ow, wb n w in-
tnitiv ly perc iv truth that principl , that truth which is
operative in natur , t up in om· Buddhic body or ·oul, a
wave, a whirl corre pond.ing to it· 1£, ·which, a ting upon the
faculty, can e · th r cognition o£ that. We do not reach it
inJuctivcly Ly a proc s. of ynth si , neither do we reach
it deduc iv ly by a proce s of analysis. It is no r ached by
rea oning from data, n ithcr by rea oning from fund, m ntal
principles, but the principl it l.f is unpres eel upon our
con ciousn and it is b canse our faculty r sponds to that
principl , to that law wbi h i operative in nature. We can
nev r know anything intuitively when the force is not at
that ti.J.ne in a stat of operation.
A static force can n v r come to ns intuitiv ly; only a
dynamic force. As thi force, however, i operative in natme,
following a certain law wh n it acts upon our faculty, it
will cause the r cognition, of this principle.
ow, a fa ulty mus be very highly d v loped to enable
it to respond to all the activitie of the world without. Re-
member how v r, that this faculty can r spond only to
those a tiviti s in tl1e univer e, those fore which op rate
through it and .lor the operation of which it ha b en volv d.
The intuitiv cognition of anything i po sjbl only when
it COlT pondin(J" fa ulty bas b en develop d to the point of
the prodigious, but when this development bas b en reach J,
it will naturally respond and thus w becom negatively
polarized to that natural fore and become th hannel

and as a person develops in this way, that 'orce act so that
35

it sp aks through him without any de ire whatever on his
part. It doe not r quire any effort of the will ; in fa t, it
would require a d finit ffort to k p from ielding to it,
becau it b com a man' nature, and he is pas ive under
its influence. Tb mathematical prodigy, th refor , can
work any problem in the world, yet he cannot t 11 how be
works it; the olution i b yond hi r ach, although he
rea he truth without any difficulty in the world; he can solve
any probl m no matter how difficult, be cannot tell how he
do it. Obviou ly he do not do it. '!'he truth i , the
mathematical proce s which are going on in the universe,
the great Ko mi harmonic laws which are the ource of,
which are back of the outer activities, work through his
intuitive faculty an tlm communi ate the olution. e
imply s the re ult, not the pro s , because he is not
rea oning the matt r out; he is not really making any calcm-
lation therefore, he is not con cious of any proc e of
mental operation.
It should be borne in mind that mathematics is Ko mical;
it i not imply a human proce , but all nature is re"'ulated
along mathemati al line and on equently tho e Ko mic
fore s may impre s th m elves upon the faculties, so that the
result will be intuitively realized.
Other prodigies, such a the mu ical, lik wise re pond to
music. ne who play by ear, as Blind Tom, simply catches
intuitively the music that has been sent forth by someone
el e, while a great mu ical genius like Beethov n or some of
those characters, will respond to the music of tl1e pheres
and r produc that.
We may take up other lines of prodigiou d v lopment,
language or beauty, or whatever we may and we can Wlder-
stand them quite plainly if we will bear in mind that every-
thin"' manif ting its lf in human faculty is also mani.f ting
in the Ko mo . uman faculties are imply the Micro osm
of th Ko rnic faculties and thu we develop in our facul ie
th op ration which are going on in the Macroco rn. In the
ordinary p r on thi i accompli hed dynamically that is to
say, he operates his facultie with a definite purpose before
him, con utratiug his attention upon c rtain end , and
riv s hi faculty along in that way, but in the Prodigy
36
THE PRODIGY
these faculties act statically. In other words, he is passive
in the bands of the Ko mic forces. The ordinary man is a
searcher for truth, he i looking into things or lle is doing
things, but the Prodigy is an in trument in the hand of the
Kosmo , b ing acted upon by the Kosmic forces; he i the
channel tlu:ough which hey op rate.
It may then be a ked, is it de irablc to be a Prodigy¥ From
the individuali tic point of view, no; from the Kosmic point
of vi w, ye . Individuality disappear in the Prodigy, for
he is no longer a man; he is the embodiment of a certain
principle; he is the tool which a certain principle uses, the
chann 1tlu:ough whi h his principle operates. He ha ceased
to be a dynamic unit; he has become a static machine; he
has b come a cog in the world machine; and so, from the
standpoint of th individual, it is not at all desirable, but
from the standpoint of the univer al it is very desirable that
all men houl i be prodigies becau e they will thus be able
to render far mor effectiv ervice to the world and to the
Ko mos than they could render under ordinary circum-
tances. 'Ihe per on who is acted upon by the niversal is
capable of accomplishing far more effective work than the
per on who is directing his O\VD a tiviti s and o if man can
get the consent of his mind to be the s rvant of the univer e
it is far b tter that h hould strive to b come the prodigy
b cau e be can then pecialize in a high degree this word
which com to him from th reat univer al harmony. The
highe t development is really found only in tho e who are
co:mm.unicating a word from nniver al harmony rather than
tho e who are trying to be everything.
The Prodigy is d p nd nt upon :
irst : a tremendou development of a definite faculty,
and he can be prodigious in on faculty, just a well as in any
other;
Second : upon a high development of the intuitional side
of nature, which means a d v lopment of the Buddhic prin-
ciple; he must also, in the
Third place, be n gative; that is, he must repr sent intui-

of thi faculty, d velop d, o that it ab orb. his n ir b iocr,
for it hould be und r tood also that Intuition may cov r a
much wid r fi ld than it bas covered in times pa t. While
it i true that prodigie hav in th pa t r pr s nt d but one
faculty, yet it is po ibl to d v lop a numb r of facu lties
to a very high degree; of course, nothing like as high as one
faculty can be dev loped but yet they can b d v lop d o
that tb y will act intuitively, but th ir ffi i n y will, of
cours , be d cr a d according as more of them ar d v lop d
to that point.

It mus aim at negativ rather than positive activity. It

tion. on s p rception is o will his con eption be. The
horizon of our knowledge i , therefore, limited to a great
d gree by the horizon of our p rception. e can n ver
xpect to form correct opinions of the world of form with-
out co1-r ct id as of form and we do not have those corr ct
id a of form unless we have corre t perception of form.
It is highly important that mankind hould realize that
in xact proportion it s e form, will it view of form be.
We may have the best proce of reasoning imaginable, but
w can never by an intellectual proc solve a orr ct con-
ception of form unl s we have een form correctly. Until
we hav attain d unto the idea of form through p rception,
we can have no conception of that form. Thi is xemplified
in the p culiar figur that ha e b en made by artists from
time to time when trying to paint som thing that no on had
ever s en-an imaginary being monster , gods, d il etc.,
what v r they may be. The most grote que is found to b
but a ombination of a numb r of tho e forms which the
arti t ha en and is familiar with. Tie can n ver by hi
imagination build up a n w form ; it is simply a combination
of other forms with which b i familiar. It, therefore,
follows bat one can never arrive at a conception of form,
whi h i not the re ult of a perception. All forms, th refor ,
that are imagined, exist. Man does not form any imagina-
tion of them until he has perceived the already existing form.
n 's education must, therefore, b gin by correct per-
ception of form, and the Organ of Form, lying b tween th
yes and back of the root of the no e, manife ting it elf,
th r fore, in the prominence of the no e immediat ly between
th y , ha for its fun tion the perception of form, and a
it b com s dev loped, it gives the capacity for a more de-
1ail d ob ervan e of form.
'rhe differ nee b v en a person with a well-developed
facuJty of form and one who faculty is but sEghtly de-
v lop d is a diff renee in detail of ob ervation. '!'here are

v lop d tbe faculty of form i , th more pow r.fnl will b
our capacity f r taking notic of tho form . Not only
do tb faculty giv apacity fo1· ob rving form, but like·
wise a propensity for noticing form. 'rhe prop 1l ity au e
us to be interested in :form, to take plea ure in ob erving
all the angl s, the lin s, everything that manif t it I.E
affu·matively, and th capacity which i found to accompany
the d velopm nt of the prop n ity giv to u th ability to
satisfy tha prop nsity. Tbe ability to b erv form and
the propen ity to xcrcise thi , are thus foun ~ to xactly
coincide with the d •gr e of d velopm nt in this fa ulty.
Inasmuch a our conception of Corm mu t be th result of
our perc ption of form and inasmuch as otu· p r p1ion of
form must be proportion d to th dcv lopm nt and activity
of our faculty and this upon tl1 iz and fitn s of our
organ of form, it follows that the d gr of dev lopment
presented in this faculty will exactly r ulatc the d gree of
accuracy and compl tene of onr conception of form.
Our education mn t begin, th r for , with th cultivation,
the prop r raining of our organ of Form. It mw t be
taught to obs rve ~ orm. It mu t ha.ve thi capacity and
al o his prop nsity. A par of th ducation of every pupil
should, therefor , be the dev lopment of his Faculty of
Form. It iJ far more important than grammar or arith-
metic, or quilting or· dre smaking, or anything of thaL kind
for th pupil in public school that they should 1J taught
to observe Form. The pupil sl10uld be given instruction
in a ural Hi tory-that is, he should not be giv n any
instruction at all but should b r quir d to give in truction
to the teacher. He should be required to tak in ect , bugs,

L ALITY
In order to acquire in ormation it is n c sary that one
should ob crv localiti s; that h bould find ou matters
which in tb ' ordinary com of thing will b rather obscme.
For this purpo there has been d v lop d tb Faculty of
Locality, having two functions fit· t, to locat and se ond
to xplore.
In tb fir t ftmction there is a propensity to carch out
localiti to la ify matt rs in relation to th plac wb re
lh y o cur; lik wis , to a sociat v r thing in r lation to
ome pot, to om lo ality, to gi a geographical cla ifica-
tion of all ma t r . Thi propcn ity can e a man to search
out and a ociate definit localities wi h all happ ning .
Wer i not for uch a propensity he would never think of
anything with refercn to locality; it would always b in
bi. consciou n s g n rally, not locally cla ificd. 'I his pro-
pensity, of cour e, prompts him to ob. erv matters locally
on quently, r ulting in the exerci e of the facul y for
locn1jug. As h s arch s out localiti s, he d velops the
fa ulty .for ob · rvi.ng th m taking notic of h m. IT has,
tb r fore, growing in him the powel' to ob erv lo ali i , to
as.o int all v uts, all object , t , with ome definit piRc .
'fbus w ltav th localizing fa ulty ro' ing in onjunc-
tion with th lo aliziug propensity. s tbi prop nsity
prompts man t look f r localiti , to try to localize e ery-
tllin , h ac umulat data in reference t location.
Jo p r on an have a devcl pcd mind, cau b du at d who
bas n t develop cl thi pt·in iple, b cau e he may hav all
lh fa ts imuginabl a hi i i posal, h may be in po sion

tion to localir. u h Lm wled" to plac . it wh r it b l ugs
to classify it in relation to place, h will be quite d fective
in hl arrang m nt of fact . .A:ny adequate information must,
ther fore, be largely d p nd nt upon the dcv lopment of
this propensity and faculty.
As all happenings ar rela d to time and place, it i very
neces ary that we should know th tim an 1 place of v ry
occurrence, in ord r to have i prop rly relat d o th Ko -
roo , tl1at i , our own Ko roo and without u •h r •lation hip
our min s will b but chaos.
Th only way to prop rly acquire such knowledg i by
dev loping th faculty and its prop •n:ity and a the pro-
pen ity grow , th incentive for taking note of th 1 ation of
everything will grow. It i the work of any prop n. ity to
indue us to u th fa ulty and a volution i by u , thi
dev lops th faculty. Th only sound way of du atiug one
in r lation to locality is, th r .for to indu e him to locate
things and to look for them, to search for thing in c rtain
pla e , to try to ucce d in localizing, to find v rythi11g aud
to know its plac . It i advisable that the pupil should b
taught to put v rything in ad finit lac to alway lmow
just wher it i . In this way he '''ill be trained to alwa sa -
so iat verythiog with a d fi.nit locality <md if h alwa s
finds that particular object in its proper place so that he
will know exactly whcr to find it, it will h lp greatly in
developing his localizing faculty, and the con ponding pro-
pensity.
In d cribing any object its locality hould always be
giv n. On hould nev r try to relieve the mind of the lo-
calizing of an object b marking its place, or anything of
that kind. A bookmark should never be mploy d. On
should fix in his mind the r lation of each plac and each
object to oth r things, for location is alway r lation. Ke p-
ing thi relation fixed in mind, he should d p nd upon it,
ab olutely. One should try to locat various buildings, in a
block, th cliff r nt room in a building, diff rent blocks in a
city. e should have the relation o:f the different streets
as ociated in his mind, should, in a word, as ociate all the
information he may ecur , with locality. Nothing bould
be chaotic; it should all b mapped out. In this way, as we
6
T t PHRENOGARTEN S TEM OF EDU ATION
map out tlw information we secme, as we put everything in i
place and associat it in thi way, we will volve our infor-
maLioll i tlo a Kosn:to instead of a hao . At th same tirue
we will b d veJoping a prop n ity for tha kind of m ntal
activity, likewi a fa ulty capable of almo t infinite la -
iii ation along th lin s.
Auything that gi' e xerci to thi part of th brain
develops it, but the more ubtile it xerci e i , the more sub-
tile will be its pow r of activity; that is to ay, locating
larg object·, immen builliug , tc., exercising our l ality
only in ref renee to thing on a large cale will uev lop the
propensity and the faculty o that w will be able to locate
ev rythino- that 'vay wiLh ea e, but the tiny object will not
be so associated. In order to acquir the power to classify
small obj ct in relation to tb ir locality, 've mu t ex rcise
our localit upon such minute obj cts for as is the ·erci e
so will b the d vel pment both of the fa ulty and the pro-
p nsity. s we d velop our lo ality w r a h th point
wher it becomes p r:fectly natural for us to associate every-
thing we see or hear with some place and to fix its place
d finitely in om memor , ther will b no dif'fi ulty .for
us to :find it again. e will have no trouble discovering
the locality where we have a ociated verything. But with
thi faculty alone, th · i no tendency to search out thing·

di cov ri s l ating objects.
Locality is thus driven by tb ·ploring prop n ity1 and
thi exploring propensity, a it grow develops h capacity
or finding thing:, for ear hing out and making di coveries.
Thus we ar ontinually adiling to our tor of information.
Our Ob ervation and ur g n ral perceptive faculties are

locating them.
Thn it may b aid tha our fa t 1 a we accumulat them

hat makes us look for things. Without this, w imply ob-

By tbu m morizing action which are p rform d in your

whether you saw it yoru· l£ or not. You tlms provide the

which have tran pir d. You thu obtain a collection of

The capacity to memorize fa ts grows naturally with de-
velopment. It may be extended to an almo t unlimit d de-
gree by practice. It is true that practice makes perfec in
ev rything, and thi i pr minently true in tb memory of
action. We develop his by exercising it, therefor , the
pupil should be taugh to rememb r what he has se n or
heard · what he ba read, v rything partaking of the natur
o£ the action; but, remember, bility to remember other
things does not in any s n e assi the memory of action
and this is what i nece ary for the hi torical work.
It i advisable to teach pupil to read torie and tb n tell
them-perhaps give a prize to the on who can tell th most
about what he ha r ad about c rtain actions. It mak no
difference wheth r th y ar r ally tru or simply a story,
just so it involves the m morizing of all g d action. This
practice will be found o be very beneficial in tbe d velop-
m nt of this faculty. It may be develop d to the point of
g nius or ev n to where one becomes a prodigy for memoriz-
ing statements.
Th re is a man in Arkansa who knows from two to three

Aft r having d v lop d the apacity form morizing action
it b comes n ce ary that tho m morie bould b as ociated
properly. It i not sufficient that we know what bas tran-
spired, that we are able to tell a number of tale . W must
also know how to a ·sociate the e activiti s in our min .
They must, in other word , be a Ko roo rath r than a hao .
W must have a c rtain hi torical continuity in our con-
s iou n . Mod m history is a science, not merely a syst m
of tale telling. We now want to know not so much what
transpired at a certain time, but wba relation it had to the
making of history; what influen e it xerci d upon the g n-
eral hi torical process; the cause which 1 d up to he v nts
and th effe ts of those ev nt . Th r fore, history is a y -

futur ; in otb r word , th hi torian mu t s the Divine
nature in all things, the working ou of the Divine purpose.
e mu.t e hi tory as an volutionary proce , and to do
this he must do more than imply r memb r ev nt . He must
pig on-hole them. e mu t know wh re to pla th m,
and the faculty of Mental sociation, which is immediately
above the M mory of Action, o upying th upper half of
the ] aculty of Eventuality, is devoted to tbi pig on-holing
of facts, mental association.
We trace out the r lation which on v nt b ars to anotb r,
and which a h b aJ. to th gen ral hi toric proc . , the

THE PHRENOGARTEN SY TEM i EDUC TIO
No person who has not developed thi capacity will ev r be
an historian. He may be able to write down those thing
which tran pire, and thus dispense with the n ce · ity for
rememb ring action ; in fact, there i little requirem nt for
this memory now, so far as hi torical work i concetn d, be-
cause we hav access to book ; but at the time when every-
thi11g was preserved by tradition, when th re w re no his-
torical works, when the Bard was the only hi torian and the
one who li tened to him ing of tb activitie of the pa and
and th n, in turn, sang of them him lf, this being the only
channel through which the historical continuity wa pre-
served, the memory of action was absolutely nece ary, but
now written records have taken the place, largely, of the
memory.
Th duty of the historian is now not o much th chroni-
ling of event a the analy is of tb m. Th hi torian do not
have to tell us what took place o mu h a why it took place
and what its consequences were. For thi rea on, th Faculty
of Mental As ociation must be develop d in a high degr e, to
enable him to recognize this r lationship for this faculty
gives him not only the ability to conn ct, but it gives the
capacity to recognize the natural relation hip exi ting between
div rse events and al o the ev nts and the cau ba k of
them and th ir logical ff cts. To trace out this r lation hip,
on must have that faculty wlti h will nable him t it.
This is developed in exact proportion to he cJ>..'ten of de-
velopment in the faculty. When thi faculty has be n de-
v lop d to th point of g nius it will naturally b come th
leading ·haracteristic of the mind. One will be a g niu for
tracing out the r lation bip existing b tw en the diff rent
events and the cause and effects. Thi will b the keynote
of his being. If he become an hi torical prodigy he will
have an intuitive capacity for associating vents. He will
see at one lightning glance, as by perc ption, the relation
which they bear on to another and th forces operative in
h hi torical evolution and to .futm activiti . It will not
r quire any rea oning, but will act lik a fl.a h as all other
intuition acts, revealing the relation which each ev nt bears
to the making of history. Thus intuition, historic perception,
is the natural consequence of the development of eventuality,

particcuarly, and Mental A sociation, at th prodigiou point.
Th hi torian i on quently, not one who ba l am d a
trad , but on who has d velop d tl1i faculty. All th
euucation in th wo ·ld will nev r teach on to b an histor-
ian. The qualities nece sary for the historian ar , to a er-
tain extent,
irst : Memory of Actions; and
econd: In a large and higher degree, the propensity
and apa ity forM ntal A ociation.
It i therefore, a natural faculty, not a trick to bel arn d.
Tiow v r, this faculty may b d v>lop d by ex r i ing, but
t d v lop th p w r of Mental A ociation on mu t men-
tally as ociate thing . It i , ther fore, right and prop r in
giving un historical le on not to be satisfi d with th pupil's
statinrr what events were involved a they ar giv u in th
book, but to make him philo ophize upon the ubj ct · make
him tell you why th se events happened ; make him trace out
the caus which l d up to th c happenings, the laws und r-
lying them and how h re the relation of cau and ffect.
l o mak him trace out the relation which each event bore
lo ev ry other at that time and also it influ nee upon th
making of hi tory-what transpired lat r, a a re ult of
U10 v nts. In oth l' word , mak him analyze th le on
in tead of imply reciting it, make him a.ct a an hi torical
·ritic and not imply recite what h read in the book· have
him riticiz it, analyz it, d al with it in a philo ophic man-
ner· make him, instead of reciting a. le on, prepare a phil-
o ophicnl e ay upon the ubject of that lesson. By training
th pupil in thi '" ay, the capacity for hi torical riti i m,
m ntal a ociation, will b developed.
It doe not make so much difference about our knowing
what ha taken plac in th pa. t unle we know h r a on
why it took pla and if w kuow tbi tltt.:n we will know
the effect it is likely to have. In oU1cr words, the pupil must
learn the evolution which is going on in h.i tory and thus
learn to judcr th future by th pa t; mu t learn the law
governing all hi toric v ntuation and when be has learned
this, h will d velop the capacity to alway as ociate things

We may accumulate data with th ar atest ease, and put

The inner po · ion, that i tb portion lying next to olor,

'I'ITE PllREN ARTE Y TEM F EDU TI
giv s neatness, while the outer portion gives Sy tem. The
faculty of Neatness is both a faculty and a propensity; that
.is, the degree of its development gives a corresponding pro-
pensity for neatness, together with the apacity for gratify-
ing that propensity. One can never be tau ht to be neat.
You may teach a pupil for y ars, b lt be can n v r learn to
be neat; but .if this faculty b com s rlevel p db will a quir
a propen ity for neatness, which will cause him to continually
take pains in that direction. He will al o acquire the ca-
pa ity for doing things neatly. The habit of "slatting"
through verything is simply du to weakness of this faculty.
In oth r words, without the faculty of rd r it wonld b
perfectly natural for ev rybody to ' slat" through whatever
h undertook. It i only by r a on of the pr · ence of the
Faculty of Qrder that one acts diff rently. As one d v lops
neatnc he mu t e:Kprc s thi quality in all hi activities.
In time the propensity will gt·ow so great that any lack
of neatne s will become absolutely painful to him. lie will
be hmt by se ing things in a di ordered tate. Thi propen-
sity for neatne s, thus growing into a tal nt, will make .it
perfectly natural for him to ben at. It will not r quire any
ffort; ev rything will come perfectly na m·al. It will b
easier for him to be neat than to be otb rwi c, and as the
propensity is continually gratifi d, the faculty will grow
nntil, in some instanc , it will develop to the point of genin .
The person will have a perfect genius for n atn othing
that is out of proper bape, that i slov nly or .in any way
antagonize this principle of neatne s, can be tol rai d.
There are people who have this propen ity o trong that
they are ready to sacrifice all other con iderations m r ly
for the sak of neatness. We ee this prop n ity very tl·ong
in the ntch and German women, in the w d and in th
women of V rmont, whil we notic it ab en e among a
gr at many oth r peopl . enerally peaking, th Am ri-
can ar la king in neatn , owing to the fact that they
ar alway· in a burr · that th y never hav tim to do
thing in a n at manner, which w:ill thus exercis thi

Evolution by Use. W mu t r cogniz that only by exerci e
can any faculty be dev loped and in exact proportion a th
faculty i xcr is d will it be d v lop d, and o will b

his or h r activities, the stronger will grow thi prop n ity
and faculty. It i utt rly use) ss to try to teach a person
neatness xcepting a you tea h him to b neat, that i x-
c pting a on teach him to actually live a life of n atne
put into practice in all his actions, becorue a ' ti kl r '
for this.
The greatc t cause of the absence of neatn s i the fac that
ne does not tal<e notic of its nb ence. He is uot awar of
th fact, for in tance, that his hat bas not been bru bed in a

that time when the habit of neatness will be permanently

Not only is neatness 11 e ary but in a till highet· d gl"

at once to relate it to tb s stem willch we have alr ady in

thought and the only way to acquire it is by y tematic
thinking.
To develop this systematic thinking it will be found advis-
able to induce the pupils to always a ociate everytillng in
their minds. Whenever r citing a l on or de ribing any-
thing which they have s en it will be advisabl to bav
them a ociate it with th sum of their knowledg or with

LESSON XI
RE SON
The int llectual faculty deal with the phenomenal world
purely, its function being to proceed inductively from phe-
nomena to the principles back of phenomena. If we would
reach the noumena, the thing in itself, would deal with it
in any manner, we must employ a faculty which transcends
the intellect. uch a faculty is the Reason located on either
side of Comparison, the faculty known to phrenologists as
aru ality.
Thi faculty is really double, that portion lying imme-
diat ly out ide of omparison b ing devoted to analysis,
and the part outside of that, to synthesis, the portion known
a the Planning Faculty.
'rhe function of the reason is to go from cause to eff ct.
W mu t be in po ssion of th caus s, therefore, in order to
know the ffects. Thus it will b s en that before the r ason
•an be mployed, one must be in possession of the cause
from which to reason.
Indu tion is the characteri tic activity of the intell ct,
whil deduction i the activity of the Reason. We b gin
with the ultimate principle as the cause; from this we d -
du th ff t which \vill logically ome from it. The
anal tic faculty must, however, d al with een ffects; its
t ud n ·y i to follow a cause logically to som sp cilic ef-
f ·t- ihat ff ct which i mo t likely to flow from that cnus .
n in poss ssion of univer al may thus deduc the par-
ti ulnrs whi h will flow from tl os univer als. '!his proce s

second ynthe i corre ponding to und 1 tanding, on 1 ts
o£ the association of these particular so a to form a logical
tructur , the logi al expre sion of the universals in a par-
ticular form. Logic i not something which we can l arn a
a trick is 1 arn d, not something consi ting of rules. All
the in truction in the world will never make a logician. The
only way by which th logician can b develop d is by
exerci ing hi Logical Fa ulty. Tbe analytic faculty, when
dev loped, give one ability to trace out the logical con-
sequ nces of th univer al . In oth r words he can take a
universal and follow it to th particular which logically
come n·om it. When tb Rea on is applied to th olution
of a problem, it does not err but, beginning with the uni-
ver al, deduces th particular effect of that cause, th logical
ffect, h only po ible effect of the cau e, c ing with the
clear vi ion of th soul, just what will logically follow from
that cau e. A a consequence, the tru analytic faculty, il
ufficiently acute will n ver mak a mi tak in tracing the
relationship of cause and ffect. iven a cau e it will a cer-
tain the effect of that cause. It does not rr in what it
accompli he . The amount of its accomplisbm nt, the d gree
of its efficiency, will d p nd upon the d gre of development.
In other words, the wi dom faculty, the analytic reason,
giv s the capacity for c rrectly recognizing the r lation of
can e and eff ct. As is its development, so will its ffici ncy
be, th refore, the only way for one to acquire the capacity
forb coming a logician is to exercise his logical faculty, that
i , r a on from cause to effect-analyze. The capacity for
analy i will incr ase in direct ratio to its exercise. At the
ame time, this faculty gives a propensity for analy i , th re-
fore, as it is exerci ed, it d velop the prop nsity, o that in
time, one will acquire a perfect mania for tracing out the
relation of cause and ffect. Given a certain cause, a univer al,
it will naturally and systematically trace out th pa1·ticular
which logically follows fi·om that univ rsal. The only way
to t ach logic is to x rei e the logical fa ulty. Do not t ach
logic from books; do not wa te any of the pupil' tim giving
him l ons. Mak him rea on.

that they are all the manifestations of one principle, being
monistic and this cau al Ko mos is continually expressing
its lf in the effectual Kosmo . All effects ar thus seeu to be
one harmonious whole, diver ely manife t d. en the
pupil realize this a a theor tical principle, be will be.gin to
trace out those relations, to connect, to ystematize all ef-
fects. 'rhus analysis will express itself in synth sis. He will
thus trace the universals to their most minute particular
manifestations the lowest form, the simplest manifestation
as well as the higher ; and by synthesis, all these forms and
manif tations the e ff ct of the Ko mic cause will be
conn cted o that the pupil will realize the one-ness of all.
This x:ercise, which is not so much or the purpo e of
learning a truth (although what is learned i absolute truth)
as it is for the purpo e of developing the rational faculty by
means ()f a sy tern of rational gymna tics, will exerci e that
faculty or rather those two faculties so as to develop their
capacity and its companion, propensity. ou will not be
developing merely the analytic, but also the synthetic
faculty.
The exercises in systematically connecting these effects
will confer upon the pupil the capacity for instantly rec-
ognizing their 1 gitimate connection. He will not merely
attempt to onn ct them, but will get o that he can see in-
ductively, the logical relation of the various effects. He
will, therefore, be not only a Genius of Analysis, but one of
Synthesis as well. This connection will be logical as well as
the connection between the effect and its cause.
As this capacity for synthesis is developed, the synthetic
propensity will be dev loped likewi e, so that the pupil will
have a perfect mania for uniting and synthesizing the va-
rious effects. In this way it will be po sible for one, begin-
ning with absolute truth, which he must ascertain from his
acuity o.f e rship, to trace out the effects of these causes
with equal exactness, and to synthesize the various effects
into one system, quite as complete as the Kosmos of causes
from which it has been deduced. It is thus that we realize
the true relation of the Rea on to absolute Truth.

R ason deal deductively with the cau s which are
recogniz d through the power of eer hip, resident in Bud-
dhi. It therefore, is a system of deduction from noum na,
just as intellect acts deductiv ly from ph nomena, and in
exact proportion as the logical .faculty is ex rei ed and in
th way that it is exerci ed, so will its strength be. There-
fore, do not for on moment hink that you can teach your
pupil to reason. You may train him unto the d v lopment
of the Rea on and the rational pow rs by inducing him to
reason, but in no other way. It is a system of rational
gymna tic , and in this field as in all others, we evolve by
EXERCISE.

LESSON XII
INTELLECT
The Intellect a contradistingui bed from the Reason, is
centered in the Faculty of Compari on, lying above Even-
tuality and below uman I ature, imrn diately in th center
of th foreh ad. Tl1is Faculty is correctly term d om-
parison, b cause its function is the comparativ study of
facts. We do not deal in ab tract reason tl!rougb this organ,
but compare data. The so-call d r a oning from data, al-
though it is not rea oning at all, is the function of this
faculty. It is the organ of ynthetic philosophy.
The popular th ory that we can know nothing in the
ultimate, cannot form any conception of the ab clute, but
must study only the relative, is due to the fact that the
human family in the main bas developed its intellect and not
its r ason. It must, a a natural con equence, tudy fact ,
but cannot rea on from principles. The inductive method
naturally follows from thi d velopment and in fact, in-
ductive thinking is purely the function of compari on. iven
correct data ecured through a proper d v lopment of th
perc ptive faculti s, and properly clas i£ed by th Faculty
of Eventuality, we will be able to reach prop r r sult in
exact proportion as our Faculty of inductive thinking-that
is, our omparison-is developed. It is not the function of
this Organ to follow any on principle or facts to the ulti-
mate. That is we do not separate a certain fact from all
other a crtions, and study it a a thing in itself. e can
only compare it with som thing else ; we can only tudy
facts as they are related to o her fact , and a a matt r of
fact, it i this method of thought, of in e ti ation that ha
been r cogniz d by all he modern chool of philosophy. It
5
THE PHRENOG.ARTEN SYSTEM: OF EDUC TION
is the ba ic principl of the pencerian chool, this chool
b ing ba d upon the compara ive tudy of phenomena. It is
pm·ely obje tiv , dep nclillg a it do , upon the tudy of
bje tive ph nom na, through tb fa ulty of ompal'ison.
In order to r ach on-ect principles through tb study of
facts, we must fil' t have our facts in th prop r form. This
facul ty Ca.J;I only deal with facts comparativ ly; it cannot
verify or di prove them. It a urn s very statement made
to it by th oth r faculti , to be true, tak everything for
granted and mak a comparative tudy of tho as umed
fact , comparing them, tl·acing out their mutual relations
and thus discovering th cause of such ph nom nal manifes-
tation.
'l'he function of ompari on i thus to discover by a om-
parative study of fa t , tb law back of and giving
pr ion to tho facts. 'l'hi is pre minently the function
of synthetic philosophy.
Inasmuch a omparison a ume all facts to be tru , th
facts must fir t be supplied in th prop r form, because
omparison will not make any n w arrangement of facts,
does not cla ii-y them, bccau e that work should have be
done by oth r faculties. i irst of all, w mu t have the per-
c ptiv s d v lop d and ex rcised with gr at accuracy so
that we will orne into po e ion of fa t relating to form,
color, w ight, ize and the o her a tributes of the subj ctive
world. 'lh n we must have d v loped tu• Mental Ob rva-
tion so as to upply our ompari on with fact discov red,
not by th physical sight or per ption i.n general, but by
th mind. We mu t b able in going over a ubject, to see
with our mind' e, tb mental fact , so to speak. When
this has be n done, we are then ready to dev lop our Mem-
ory of Action. Thi must absolutely be brought to a high
ta e of ll':iciency, o that we will not only pre ent our om-
pari on with what we see at a given mom nt but will have
tor l up in our m mory, a line of A-periences that may be
suppli d. Likewise, we must have acquired a fund of hap-
p nings and occurrences a w ll a mere objects of sight.

nev r go b yond the facts; it can only di cover the prin iple
un.d rlying those facts. It mu t, therefore, depend upon
the ph nomenal.
How v r, the Int llectual Faculty is not confined exclu-
sively to ompari on. The upp r portion of thi j acuity,
lying nee rest to uman ature, is in r ality, a <li in t Fac-
uJt , though b longing to the Intcll ct. This is the •acuity
of ritic' m. ow, riticism make a mu h lo. r xamina-
tion of the facts than ompari on doe ; in fact ompari on
does not, in any sense criticize it do s not argue; it imply
puts tog th r and studi comparativ ly. It a ume all the
facts to be true. The function of rit.i ism i ju t the re-
verse. It i to examine th facts and find out whether or
not they have been accurately tated.
7
THE PHRENOGART N Y TEM OF EDUCATION
The po ition of this Faculty of Criticism is rather ug-
gestive. It is located between omparison and Human Na-
ture or Intuition. rom thi w should r alize that the lower
part of the organ of uman ature, th p ychical center, the
center from which many of our higher p ychical power are
derived, con equently, tran mits to our riticism, facts as-
certained by the exercise of the psychical sen e, e r hip.
These are, of course, of a transcendental character and mu t
not be too readily accepted. It is the £unction of our Crit-
icism to analyze th e, to criticize them and try to find fault
with them, if po sible and thus to r 1 gate to oblivion all
tho e things which are not really sound. But the difficulty
is that we will exerci e this critical power according to our
education; that is, one who ba been educated along material-
istic line will have a trong tendency to be rather s v e in
his criticism of all facts of a transcendent character, whil he
will be lenient with everything of a materialistic charact r.
This is the great cliffi.culty. Critici m a it is developed, does
not give an accurate judgment of the value of such ma ters;
that is, it does not free one from bias, but simply give the
power to look into matt~rs and to see the flaw in a state-
ment. Thus our experiences will largely determine the re-
ult of our criticism, but the critical power, the power to
see the flaw is given by a dev lopment of this faculty of
Critici m. Not only is our fore ight, but our intuition
everything of the kind, criticiz d, thus bringing all tho e
facts through tb si. ve of critici m b fore they ar admitted
into our mental tor hou e. Likewise, all facts pr ented
through the r gular perceptive faculties mu t be criticized
before they go on to the Rea on, but th re i tb.i di:ff renee ;
all intutionally a certained fact ar criticized before they
go to ompari on, whereas the other facts are riticized
afterwards. t is not the facts, but the conclu ion or the
laws a s01ned from those facts, that are ubjected to the
power of Criticism. They are th re examined and, if they
win approval, pa on to the Reason.
It should be born in mind that Comparison is not con-
£ned to those facts discover d by the phy ical senses, but the
psy hical ens , all below tb Buddhic Plane, ar likewise
included in th perc ptives and they supply their data as
INTELLECT
well a tb phy ical senses. Therefore, Comparison may be
depended upon when the psychical faculties are active for
an inductive study of p ychi al a well as physical facts, up
o the Buddhic. However this Faculty can not bring us
into the recognition of ab olute Truth. As its very nature
adapts it to the study of phenomena, it can do nothing with
noumena. It can never bring us to cognition of the nou-
menal, being pur ly an inductive phenomenal facul y.
How are we to develop the Intellect1 By exercising it.
o one ver did or ever will learn to think except by think-
ing. ll schools intended to teach correct thinking or to
teach a person how to classify facts and place them in their
prop r relation are absolutely worthl s. Th re is no school
in ex.i tence, the purpo e of which is to teach people bow to
study, that is worth powder and shot. The only way by
which a person will ever learn the comparative study of
phenomena is by studying in this way-by exercising the
Faculty.
Thus, if one would acquire a high development of om-
pari on, he must compare things, study various facts in a
comparative manner; study the relationsbjp which exi t
between different facts and after putting in month and
mon hs of this kind of study, tracing out the relation hip,
the pupil will develop this Faculty and with its d velop-
ment will come, fu· t a propensity for tracing out those
relation rup , and econd, a capacity for r cognizing such
r lationships. At fh·st, it may be slightly laboriou , but in
time, it will become quite delightful to trace out these re-
semblances and to see tb relation existing between diff rent
facts. As this propensity grows, it will thu prompt the
pupil to such study, and in this way, by exercising the Fac-
ulty, the power will also grow, the ability to trace out the
relation.
Again to develop Criticism, you must criticize. You must
ee the :flaws that are in statements of facts, th flaws that are
in argum nts, even, the :flaw that are in your fri nds--any-
thing of the kind. Criticism is pr eminently the .fault-find-
ing faculty and it can b develop d only by findin .fault. y
seeing wh re fallacy lie ; in this way on i abl t analyz
and by a.nalyz:jug by differentiating between tb fal and
THE PHRE ARTEN Y TEM OF E U TIO
the true he will develop a propensity for such criticism,
thus prompting him to more and mor exerc· e of the fac-
ulty and at the ame tim h v.rill d lop th apa ity for
uch criticism, for s eing the fault in any statement of
facts.
We may, therefor , say that synthesis is the function of
Comparison ;-anaJysi of ritici m, and compari on, tne
synthetic faculty, is dev loped only by ynth izing fa ts;
Criticism, the analyzing fa ulty, is to be developed only by
analyzing tat ment of fact and thi v oul al o apply to a
theory, to a doctrine, anything of the kind. It i by analyz-
ing that the capacity for analy is i d v lop d and by
synthe izing that the capacity for yntbe is i developed.
Therefor , we 1 arn to do things by doin them. t i not
that we learn anything. No one ever learned a thing in the
world; but we ev lop the faculty for doing certain things
and with it a propensity for doing those things. Thu we
have an incentive for fm·ther action.
The only way to educate the pupil's intellect is, therefore,
to give exercise to his acuities of Analy is and Synthesis.
