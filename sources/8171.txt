It was holiday season; so many people were there to enjoy the holidays. My sister, I and my childhood friend were together, playing in knee-deep water. 

What happened was like a scene from the movie. Things happened at a flick of a finger. The next moment was terrifying, as we found us, me, my sister and my friend, drowning and we couldn't reach the bottom of the sea floor. I was with my sister.  At first, we were both trying to grab each other's shoulders to catch our breath. Then after a while, I just felt that my sister and I were spinning around.

Suddenly, I felt different. It was surreal. It was as if I'm at peace. I can see the water bubbling and I saw many white lights around us. I felt that I could breathe inside the water. I didn't feel terrified anymore.

The next thing I knew, we were at the shore and safe. My mother said the fishermen saved the three of us. When I asked my friend what happened to her, she said that she was drowning upside down. Her hands were being pulled down underneath the sea floor.
