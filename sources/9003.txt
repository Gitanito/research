  		              		Experience Description   

    When I was a teenager, I was put to sleep to have all 4 wisdom teeth surgically removed. I slowly levitated out from my body, seeing the dentist, an assistant, and other people sitting around me. I slowly kept floating up, until I got to the ceiling. Then I went through the ceiling and into  the attic. About half way to that ceiling, I started slowing down my ascent and was move forward until I was  in a sleeping on my tummy position. But I was still in mid-air and could see other people floating in mid-air. I knew then that they were other patients who had  been put to sleep and were out of their body just like me. We didn't try to speak to each other but were all aware of each other. When the whole experience was done, I continued my motion up to the attic ceiling and then rotated, so I was facing downwards.  Then I  continued in slow motion back through the dentist's ceiling, seeing my body lying there. They were done operating and were just finishing up. I kept floating down to my body, and  remember in extra slow motion. But once I reached my body, I just floated right back into it. 

  Next thing I knew, the nurse was trying to wake me up.  I was so groggy and couldn't  understand her.  Once I woke up enough to think straight, I realized I was in a different room than the operating room. I had no idea the out of body experience could happen when being put to sleep by the doctor. The experience seemed to last like 2 minutes. I remember when waking up, thinking there was no way they could have done the whole 4 extractions in only those few short minutes.   
  
Background Information:     

Gender: 	Female  

NDE Elements:     

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?       No.  Surgery-related            

How do you consider the content of your experience?      Stay about the same  

  Did you feel separated from your body?    Yes  Same as when they put me to sleep except not in same exact spot. I remember seeing my shoes were on my body. I could see but while looking down towards my  feet in my  new body, I could see that my shoes were also on those feet as well  
  
At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?       The highest and most aware I have ever experienced before or since.    

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?       Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning    

  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.    No, completely quit hearing  
  
  Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?       Yes     In the attic, I could see other people who were under anesthesia who were out of their bodies and  floating above their exam room. They were fully aware  like me. There was no need for communication because we were already aware that we all were aware what was happening with our real bodies. We were all collectively  aware and full of calmness.  
  
Did you see an unearthly light?       No     

  What emotions did you feel during the experience?       Confusion that I was awake when  they had just put me to sleep.  I was entirely more awake then I ever had been. Also a bit scared when floating into the top of room that I was gonna crash into it. It was neat to feel floating.  I was impressed of myself that I somehow knew the other people I was seeing were other people whom had been put under a anesthesia. I also knew that the doctor and the  nurse were not under anesthesia as we were.  I knew that they were actually awake and working on my sleeping body that I was no longer in.  
  
Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?     I felt united or one with the world  

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?       Everything about the universe       

Did you come to a border or point of no return?       I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will  

God, Spiritual and Religion:     

  Have your religious practices changed since your experience?       Not to sound suicidal or anything because I'm not. Life's not too bad, but I want to be in that place instead of here.  I know when I die I'll be closer to that place than I am here alive 
  
Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?       Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience       

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:     

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?       I just have accepted it
  
After the NDE:     

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      No     

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       Uncertain     

  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?        I now know there is this place where all people can be out of their bodies and it can be the same place for everybody who are out of there bodies  
  
Have you ever shared this experience with others?         Yes  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?     Uncertain     

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?        No
