 There seems to have been a hiatus between August 1922 and May 1923.  The vast number of pages in later issues reflects the journal's practice of reprinting without comment books and lengthy extracts from authors presumably associated with its work.   The subtitle of the journal changed to Revue Initiatique in February 1921.  The journal was begun with a focus on spiritualism but moved consistently towards occultism, Tarot, astrology, chiromancy, psychic studies, Martinism, talismans, spiritual hierarchies, magnetism, Egyptian Mysteries, etc.   The journal was intended as the organ of the Amis de Marie Routchine of the Ordre du lys et de l'aigle.  On Routchine, Semelas, and the Order, see the  note under Force de la Verite.  BNF.
