there was a time when I was willing to
kind of play along with some of these
inventors with their secret proclivities
and that was a decade ago at this point
the answer is no no yet never in going
to happen and the reason is if I know
what the result is going to be at the
end you&#39;d be insane to start it at the
beginning alright so it isn&#39;t for
nothing that since 1992 and 1993 I&#39;ve
been having meetings and doing briefings
for the head of army intelligence and
the CIA director and putting it together
presidential briefings and moving around
with you know getting Rockefeller to
host the Clintons at the ranch to go
through all this stuff with them some of
this you know some of you don&#39;t but you
learn through those lessons and what I
have learned is where I started
disclosure complete openness about all
these technologies you cannot fix this
problem from the consciousness that
created it and greed avarice secrecy
that&#39;s what&#39;s gotten us where we are
that is at the core of the massive oil
fossil fuel national security super
state that we have built up around us so
if you use that same consciousness
you&#39;re not going to escape from that
black hole so we have to have a whole
new consciousness that guides these
endeavors or we&#39;re going to repeat
history over and over and over and over
again and that is the great tragedy of
our time is that because this subject is
sort of the stepchild of science and
there has been a divide-and-conquer
nature to all these inventors who one
will pop up in England one will pop up
like Stan Meyer in the Midwest one will
pop up and Australia one will pop up in
South America and there are all these
sort of lone wolves out there that are
easy to pick off one at a time
so we have to come together as a people
and do this very overtly not secretively
with a proper public involvement because
the public wants this 99% 99.9% of the
pub the people on planet earth would
benefit from this there is a very
various not the 1% it&#39;s the point
oo-oo-oo-oo 1% who would not benefit
from this because they are the ones
sitting atop the petro dollar system the
macroeconomic order and particularly the
fact that it is run and everything we&#39;re
using is run on a metered linear energy
source even solar and wind the big two
billion dollar a solar farm being done
out in the desert of California I mean
that&#39;s a huge thing but it&#39;s all
centralized with a centralized utility
what happens when you have something
that would fit on this table and now
we&#39;re on your house pulling energy from
the quantum vacuum or the zero-point
energy field
you don&#39;t need utilities how many people
have stock portfolios with utilities in
them bye-bye
you don&#39;t need ExxonMobil you don&#39;t need
BP you do not need coal so there goes
all of Australia&#39;s coal exports to China
unnecessary don&#39;t need it on and on and
on and on it goes
so there would be an impact but if we
don&#39;t do it the impact we&#39;re facing is a
thousand times worse which is a
geopolitical order where we&#39;re you&#39;re
likely to see a war in the South China
Sea over oil deposits where we have this
situation now in the Ukraine and Crimea
and with Russian gas and Europe needing
it the Middle East conundrum on and on
it goes so beneath that is a deeper
crisis true statistic 48% of inhabitants
of earth do not have indoor plumbing so
the old saying don&#39;t have a pot to pee
in
literally forty-eight percent of the
seven billion people on earth
so we have this growing disparity
between the people who have things and
those who do not but that is what
happens and it gets a very extreme
before every massive global revolution
or war like in the 20s before the Third
Reich rose I think we have to begin to
look at this and say how can we stay on
this path when the outcome is huge
problems with the environment even if
you don&#39;t believe in climate change as a
result of fossil fuel these other issues
are going to catch us before that does
so long before we have a problem with
the client which is actually we&#39;re
having a problem the human report that
came out this week makes it quite clear
but even if you don&#39;t accept that in
your paradigm the inhumanity of keeping
these sciences and technologies away
from the public and the poverty that it
engenders because I was talking to an
industrialist from India and he was
telling me it would take trillions of
dollars to properly electrify the
subcontinent so that people have the
energy they need using the today&#39;s
conventional systems even solar even
when even a coal and you know we&#39;re
looking faced in a situation now that
every year or two there&#39;s a thousand new
coal-fired burning power plants being
put online in India China and elsewhere
mostly without any scrubbers so in the
Pacific Northwest and other places you
have a huge amount of the pollution
that&#39;s in the West Coast it&#39;s coming
from Asia for the new scrubbers and
those a cult and you look at the air in
Beijing and Shanghai and other cities
it&#39;s not breathable then you go to the
oceans where you have the Fukushima
reactor releasing all this radioactive
material and huge parts of the oceans
because there&#39;s all the co2 going into
the oceans are beginning to die because
of the acidity and alkaline levels being
upset so there are all these big macro
geo physical effects while we&#39;re trying
to maintain the current macro economic
order big problem
huge mistake but who&#39;s gonna fix it this
this is really the crux of the problem
and many people have asked me given the
folks I&#39;ve met with over the years why
doesn&#39;t someone do that but see everyone
says that my wife and I this week were
just up in New York meeting with the
head of a foundation and the question
came up frequently with people there all
of whom were incredibly wealthy well why
doesn&#39;t Bill Gates do it or why doesn&#39;t
the president it&#39;s always why doesn&#39;t
someone else of course if you go to the
president he&#39;ll no way Jose and if you
go to billionaire X and billionaire Y
and billionaire Z many of whom I&#39;ve met
with they&#39;ll go you know one of them
once said to me we all want to be first
to be second great expression you hear
it a lot in business when it&#39;s a very
controversial science no one wants to be
the first stick their neck out so this
becomes then a leadership issue which is
what I&#39;ve tried to provide some clarity
to in my own humble way being not a
significantly a wealthy or powerful
person at all but knowing what I know
try to share it with the public and try
to create a momentum towards disclosure
not only of the fact that we&#39;re not
alone in the universe but that the
secret behind these UFO propulsion
systems and energy systems would give us
an entirely new planet beautiful but
there are stakeholders who are very very
powerful who aren&#39;t happy about that now
you know at the World Economic Forum at
Davos a few months ago couple months ago
it came out that there is about 17 they
said 35 but it&#39;s actually more like 32
and the Swiss Institute said more like
17 people in corporations that those
people control that have about 50 the
equivalent of the net worth of the
lowest 50 percent of the world&#39;s
population which is true and some of
these folks I have met with and briefed
over the years and in fact very recently
as some of you may have heard I can&#39;t go
into any details about it I was asked to
go to an island in the last few months
with about 120 world leaders and people
from Goldman Sachs and McKenzie and
Boston Consulting Group and various
people and I wasn&#39;t allowed to bring any
any assistance or I could have brought
my wife but it was - for she knew Phil I
shouldn&#39;t like travelling so much and so
I went by myself and it was daunting not
because of who was there but what the
task was because there were either
people there who knew that this existed
and were seething that I was on the
agenda or there were people who knew
nothing about it and had no foundation
for understanding it and I had 45
minutes to discuss it now you know
that&#39;s the nature of these kind of
concepts if you ever been to any of
those sort of things but we&#39;ve made a
lot of progress with that because the
head of this Institute that hosts this
event every year ended up asking us to
take the disclosure project a two-hour
DVD that has all you know dozens and
dozens of these military witnesses and
also has the presidential briefing
document the early ones that we put
together in they&#39;re embedded in a PDF
file and sent it to the top 50 people
who were there so and that was recently
or 30 people so we&#39;re continuing that
educational process but time and time
and time again whether I&#39;m oh I was in
LA I was given a talk to a group and
there were about a hundred and ten
people there but 12 of them were
billionaires and every single one of
them would say well I wouldn&#39;t want to
do something like this but so and so
might and it&#39;s kind of like the little
red hen you know yeah everyone would
like to see this happen nobody wants to
do it and and so that you know it&#39;s kind
of comical and I kind of feel like you
know Laurance Rockefeller back in 93
turned to me and with 94 20 years ago
and he says don&#39;t leave your medical
career because really no one&#39;s going to
take any risks with something this
controversial and you know you&#39;ll just
end up being the court jester for a lot
of the public
and a lot of the elites not court jester
but you know information or infotainment
but no one&#39;s really really kind of stick
their neck out on this because this is
too heavy a lift and I was appalled at a
cynicism and twenty years later I go you
know the guy well guy was right it&#39;s
sort of a sad view of that situation but
ultimately I have to take the view that
we as a people can still do this I&#39;m the
eternal optimist you have to be if
you&#39;re an emergency doctor you know
you&#39;re working everything to save that
three-year-old child
and believe it you can and you can&#39;t do
sometimes and sometimes you can&#39;t but
that&#39;s the mindset of an emergency
physician and I think that we what we
have to look at is what does it take to
do something wonderful for our children
and our children&#39;s children and it can&#39;t
be the consciousness of what&#39;s in it for
me when that&#39;s course the whole concept
of intercapital and and most
technological plays for example here&#39;s a
mistake many people have made they come
up with one of these systems maybe it&#39;s
a prototype that&#39;s only putting out a
hundred watts of quote free energy
that&#39;s coming from the vacuum I even
over what&#39;s going into it so say let&#39;s
you know there&#39;s 10 watts going in 100
watts coming out I know many people
there&#39;s a man at Lawrence Berkeley labs
who had done this and they get
approached by someone says Oh will work
with me and we&#39;re a VC group and here&#39;s
50 million dollars for a start-up guess
what those folks are either shilling
they&#39;re fronting for the intelligence
community or they&#39;re sincere but then
someone comes in later with five billion
dollars and buys them out
I met with such a man not long ago at my
home in Virginia out on our farm and he
says oh yeah well you know fifty million
dollars wouldn&#39;t be a problem but I
would want to have control over the
corporation and the technology I said I
don&#39;t think that&#39;s really a good idea
have you ever gone mano-a-mano with the
national security state he says no but
I&#39;ve done a lots of you know
apps and you know stuff and you know he
thought this was like coming out with a
new iPhone app not so that&#39;s how little
he understood about what was what we&#39;re
facing here and I said well the problem
with that is let me just ask ask you a
question if you put 50 million dollars
into that research and development
program and came out with a prototype of
something that would run on people&#39;s
homes take them off the grid
self-sufficiency lift the third world
out of poverty in three four years five
years at the most
but the way technologies can spread
today in the world he but someone
offered you five billion dollars for
your 50 million dollar funding what
would you do is if I&#39;m a businessman
I would sell I said no you&#39;re a money
 and you have just sold out the
future of the world to another front
organization that&#39;s going to bury it now
there&#39;s a term for this in our community
that I use called black shelving black
shelving means a corporate interest will
buy up a technology because it is a
threat to other horizontally and
vertically integrated parts of their
corporate structure and just put it on a
black shelf and keep it there now
there&#39;s a man who&#39;s a 747 pilot for
United Airlines who&#39;s retired now but he
grew up with a gentleman who was
inventing amazingly efficient
carburetors in the 50s that we&#39;re
getting these heavy clunker cars you
know those great big cars that were
running and getting 8090 miles per
gallon because of some of these
electromagnetic the things that he was
in well the auto companies and the oil
companies kept buying him out and he
retired on that money and his attitude
was I got mine I&#39;m rich now one of the
scientists a lieutenant colonel down
near the Huntsville Space Flight Center
Redstone Arsenal Alabama I was at his
home and he has worked a great deal in
this area and classified projects and he
was looking at one it was a gentleman
who had a electromagnetic motor and he
tested it and this is a PhD physicist by
the way this was the real thing this is
not one of these frauds and tricks that
are out there on the internet most of
which we&#39;ll get to in a moment are
tricks and frauds and he said this was
the real thing the guy disappeared for a
few months the next time he saw him the
guy had a Lamborghini in Armani suit
seriously and wouldn&#39;t even talk to this
physicist and said I can&#39;t talk about
that technology it&#39;s been sold that was
in the 80s that was 30-some years ago
now there&#39;s another part so if you make
it if you get past the national security
apparatus there are all these business
traps where if the money is initially
clean but the entity is controlled by
people who are mainly interested in
money and power they&#39;re gonna sell to
someone who will black shelve it it&#39;s
not if that will happen it&#39;s when
because we have documented that this has
happened over and over and over and over
and over again
