The journal is essential for the early history of Tingley's Theosophical Society and its international spread.  It contained contributions by or notes on Albert G. Spalding, Clark Thurston, Iverson Harris, August Neresheimer, Cyrus Field Willard, Burcham Harding, Alexander Wilder, Reginald Machell, et al.  It carried reports on the progress of Tingley's international crusade, accounts of new journals around the world that adhered to Tingley, a Children's Department, and extensive photographs of the members of the society and the headquarters at Point Loma (and of the extraordinary tableaux vivants presented there).  Noted in Neue Metapsychische Rundschau, June-July 1898, and in Notes and Queries, August 1900.

 An organ of Katherine Tingley's branch of Theosophy, most notable today because the issue for August 13, 1905, in an article on "Major-General Abner Doubleday" adds the note:  "It is of interest to note the fact that it is to this stanch Theosophist, well-known army officer and author, that the national game of Base Ball owes not only its name, but also in large degree its development from a simpler sport; or, indeed, according to some writers, its very invention."  This was the second promulgation of the claim (first made by a man named Abner Graves a few months earlier in an Ohio newspaper) and its publication probably owed much to the fact that Albert G. Spaulding, the sporting goods robber baron, was in the process of trying to establish baseballâ€™s pedigree and was, with his wife, a member of Tingley's Theosophical Society and lived at Lomaland.  Doubleday, despite the lack of any evidence to support the claim, was a worthy candidate because he had joined the Theosophical Society in New York in 1878, had acted as its "President Ad Interim" when Blavatsky left for India, and had worked closely with W.Q. Judge, Tingley's predecessor in the American Theosophical Society.
