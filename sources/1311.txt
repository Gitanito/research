PART 134
REPORT ON CASES OF APPARENT PRECOGNITION
By H. F. Saltmarsh
The phenomenon of supernormal precognition is generally held to
be one of the most puzzling, the most mysterious of all the mysteries
which are presented to the psychical researcher. That a human
being, conditioned in space and time, should be able under certain
rather rare and exceptional circumstances to acquire knowledge of
future events raises problems of the utmost importance, not only for
psychical research, but also for philosophy and metaphysics and
possibly for physical science itself, for it seems obvious that the
solution of this problem must somehow involve a conception of the
nature of time.
Obviously the first point to be determined is whether precognition
ever actually occurs.
There can be no doubt that precognition of a sort is a reality ; we
can foretell many future events with more or less certainty. The
astronomer predicts the movements of stars and planets, the chemist
knows in advance the reactions of his reagents, the meteorological
ofiice, though not so conspicuously successful, achieves a percentage
of true forecasts which is in excess of what might be attributable to
pure chance.
In the psychical realm we can sometimes predict a man's be-
haviour under given circumstances ; we are even more successful
when dealing with crowds and the statistical determination of the
annual figures of such things as marriage, murder and suicide, all
of which are at least partially psychically determined, show a
surprising degree of accuracy.
Now all these precognitions have one feature in common, they are
based on inferences from past experience and rely on the assumption
that the causes and conditions which have operated in the past will
D 49
50 H. F. Saltmarsh [part
continue to do so with more or less uniformity in the future. They
are all instances of what may be called normal precognition. But
psychical research has to do with the supernormal.
I have therefore made an examination of the records of the
Society, as embodied in the Journal and Proceeditigs , from its be-
ginning and have extracted and summarised all cases of precog-
nition. It may be that I have overlooked some isolated examples of it
which have occurred mixed up with other more striking phenomena
or reported in a paper or article not specifically dealing with the sub-
ject, but I do not think that much of importance has been missed.
I have included all the cases I could find in which an element of
precognition was apparent. As I shall show when I come to analyse
them, some of these may not be true examples of supernormal pre-
cognition but may be susceptible of another explanation. Some I
have had to reject altogether on the grounds that the appearance of
precognition was either false or else too vague to be considered
evidential ;
they are placed under the last two headings of my first
classification, i.e. vague or non-precognitive. The remainder of the
cases which are considered as susceptible of another explanation
contain for the most part some supernormal element, such as tele-
pathy or hyperaesthesia, and the explanation suggested requires the
assumption that these phenomena have occurred.
It must, however, be noted that the alternatives suggested are
never more than hypothetical and it may well be that if a final
analysis should show good grounds for holding that supernormal
precognition does sometimes occur, that interpretation may in many
of the cases in question be preferred to the alternative. In the
statistics which follow I have included these possibly dubious cases
but have excluded those which, as I have said, I reject altogether.
The nature of the statistical facts is such that the question of alter-
native explanation has no relevance.
I have also studied the few papers which have been read on the
matter, particidarly those of Mrs Sidgwick and Mr Myers, and I here
desire to acknowledge my indebtedness thereto.
Although a few examples of precognition may have escaped my
net the haul is sufficiently impressive. I have been able to collect
some 349 cases ; some few of them are multiple, that is to say,
recording more than one instance.
Having summarised these cases I then proceeded to analyse and
classify them. I grouped them first under the type of impression
and sub-divided each type into four headings, viz. Good, Ordinary,
Vague and not precognitive.
A Good case is one where the precognition is particularly definite
and detailed, or where the evidence is exceptionally good. An
Ordinary case is one which, although it does not attain to the above
134] Report OIL Gases of AjJparent Precoijnition 51
standard, is sufficiently evidential of precognition to be significant.
The fact that it has been deemed worthy of publication is itself some
guarantee for this.
I have classed as Vague those cases where there was nothing of a
definite nature to indicate that a precognition had occurred or
nothing conclusively to connect the event which is reported as
fulfilling the prediction with the alleged precognition. For example :
if A hears the ticks of a death watch and during the next few weeks
a relative dies, that would be a vague case. Or if B has a vague
impression of calamity or sees an unrecognised hallucinatory vision,
and subsequently experiences some misfortune to which there was
no obvious reference in the impression or hallucination, the case
would come under this class.
The class of non-precognitive cases are those where there is reason
to think that the event referred to was simultaneous with or prior
to the dream, impression, hallucination, etc. or else that the whole
thing was clearly attributable to mere chance.
The following is the result of the analysis :

Before discussing the figures a few remarks on the various head-
ings should be made.
Borderland cases—a very small class—are those where the impres-
sion occurs between sleep and waking, so that it is impossible to say
whether it was a dream or waking impression. I do not think that
there is any particular significance in this division of classification,
but it appeared to me desirable to make it for the sake of accuracy.
Impressions are, of course, waking impressions not attaining the
status of definite hallucination.
Mediumistic cases include predictions made by recognised med-
iums together with a. very few cases of precognition in hysteria and
analogous states.
Crystal cases, another very small class, are precognitions occurring
52 H. F. Sahmarsh [part
while crystal-gazing, or during some other form of scrying. It is
clear that the dividing line between the classes is not in some cases
perfectly hard and fast. For example, crystal-gazing cases might
well be included in the mediiimistic class, or an impression might
almost reach the point of hallucination.
Also there are cases where several types are joined together, e.g.
a precognitive dream may be preceded or followed by an impression,
or else A may have a dream while B experiences an hallucination,
both apparently having the same reference. Although there is this
unavoidable lack of definition in some cases the majority fell into
their respective classes clearly and definitely, and I do not think that
any conclusions which may be drawn from the figures would be mate-
rially affected by any re-arrangement which might possibly be made.
It will be observed that, with the possible single exception of
waking impressions, all the classes occur in states wherein there is
some dissociation. Even in the case of impression it is not un-
reasonable to suppose that some slight dissociation occurs, as there
are instances where the impression was so overwhelming as almost
to amount to hallucination. The impression comes into the mind,
not by association with any of its supraliminal contents, but appar-
ently as imposed on it from without ; it possesses an unaccountable
compulsive force. It cuts through and intrudes upon the normal
flow of thought. Now, if all cases of precognition are accompanied
by or take place during a state of dissociation, I think it may be
concluded with a fair degree of certainty that the part of the mind
involved is the subliminal.
This, perhaps, is not a very striking or original conclusion ; in
fact it is only what we should have expected a priori. I merely
wish it to be put on formal record at the very outset of the inquiry as
it may be found later on to have an important bearing on theory. To
turn now to the figures themselves. It will be noticed that the dream
is a long way the most prolific source of precognitions ; moreover it is
among dream cases that we find the highest percentage of good cases.
Hallucinations come next in point of number but fall rather low
in the proportion of good to ordinary ; moreover there is an un-
usually high percentage of vague cases. This, I think, is perfectly
reasonable. From the nature of an hallucination the details given
are not as a rule as full as with a dream, so that definite reference
to a particular event, the absence of which renders a case liable to be
relegated to the vague class, is less likely to be found and recorded.
As examples of this one might cite the fairly numerous cases where
the percipient hears unaccountable knocks or ticks and shortly
afterwards suffers the loss by death of a near relation. The knocks
may be a vague precognitive phenomenon not reaching to the
height of definite knowledge, but in t^^". absence of any indication
134] Beporf on Cases of Apparent Precognition 53
of tlie identity of the person to whom they refer, even where the
percipient regards them as a warning of approaching death or
bereavement, the cases are so nebulous and uncertain that they
cannot be held to be of any value as evidence.
The next class, mediumistic, presents a better average of good
cases, though still falling far short of dreams in this respect, while
the percentage of vagues is roughly the same. As regards this class,
however, I feel that little or no reliance can be placed on any con-
clusions based on numbers, for I cannot regard my collection as
being in any way a fair sample of the total amount of precognitive
matter found in the iitterances of trance mediums. I should say
that the number of mediumistic cases of precognition actually pub-
lished bears a very small ratio to the total of such cases. From my
own knowledge of Mrs Leonard's trance utterances, a knowledge
which covers only a relatively small fraction of the whole, it appears
to me that instances of apparent precognition are fairly frequent.
They may not be of a very striking character, but this, from the
theoretical point of view, is irrelevant. Precognition of the most dull
and commonplace events demands explanations just as much as
does the most startling prophecy.
Mediumistic cases possess the advantage of being able to give a
greater amount of detail than is possible with hallucinations or
impressions, though they fall short of dreams in this respect. This,
subject to the uncertainty of conclusions drawn from the number
available, is shown in the somewhat higher ratio of good to ordinary
cases.
As regards impressions we have to take into account a special
consideration. Precognitive dreams are, as a rule, of peculiarly
impressive character, which renders them more liable to be remem-
bered and recounted by the dreamer than are the ordinary normal
dreams. While it is true, as some of us know to our cost, that there
are people who habitually bore the breakfast table with accounts of
their dreams, to the credit of humanity it must be admitted that
such malefactors are comparatively rare. The dreams they tell are
for the most part very dull and ordinary.
The peculiar characteristics possessed by the true precognitive
dream induces the dreamer sometimes to record it in writing, some-
times to regard it as a warning to be acted upon, but more often to
recount it to other people with special emphasis. Mediumistic pre-
cognitions are for the most part embodied in the records of sittings,
while hallucinations are sufficiently uncommon and striking events
to be specially noted and remembered. Impressions, however, may
range from the vague feelings of disquiet which, I suppose, everyone
is liable to experience, up to those so relatively massive and detailed
as to amount almost to hallucination.
54 H. F. SaUmarsh [part
It would occur to no one to note and remember every passing
impression, and thus it must happen that many which might pos-
sibly be precognitive are passed by and forgotten. Even of those
which are remembered and recognised as having been fulfilled, many
are likely to be deemed unworthy of being reported. It is only the
most impressive that would be considered sufficiently interesting
to be placed on record.
There are cases where the impression is definitely felt to concern
some particular person, there are others where it is so strong as to
be regarded as a warning to be acted upon. It is significant that
there is a larger proportion of warning cases with impressions than
with any of the other types.
I think that we are safe in assuming from these considerations
that the reported cases of impression do not represent so high a per-
centage of the total number of such incidents as with dream or
hallucination. One would have expected, a priori, that the pro-
portion of good to ordinary would be lowest among impressions,
whereas, though last but one in the list, it is considerably above
hallucination.
I think that this may be accounted for by the fact that the poorer
cases would be thought not worth reporting, or, if reported, not
worth publishing.
As regards the remaining two types, viz. Borderland and Crystal-
gazing, the number of these cases is so small that the figures can
have no significance as statistics.
The percentage of cases rejected as non-precognitive has no
interest.

or 281 cases in all.
In rejecting the vague and non-precognitive cases I do so for
safety's sake ;
if, on the evidence of those remaining, supernormal
precognition is found actually to occur, then some of these rejected
cases may well have been real instances of it.

It will be observed that the totals in this classification are in some
instances slightly higher than the total number of cases given above.
This is, of course, because some of the cases exhibit precognition
of more than one type of incident.
There is a certain amount of ambiguity between some of these
headings. For example, an accident to a material thing such as a
fixe or carriage accident, might be classed as such or as an incident,
trivial or not, according to its nature. In actual practice, this
particular ambiguity has not been felt. I have experienced no
difiiculty in classifying under these headings except perhaps, in a
very few cases, certainly not sufficiently numerous materially to
affect results.
Of course, the distinction between trivial and not trivial is very
vague. However, in most cases no doubt arose. One would not
class precognitions of the Great War under the heading of trivial
incidents, or even such a matter as the failure of the bank wherein
the dreamer had her money. On the other hand, the call of a com-
mercial traveller selling books could hardly be called anything but
trivial.
Under accidental death I have classed the few cases of death by
murder.
56 H. F. Saltmarsh [part
Under arrival cases I have included arrivals of ])ersons and mess-
ages, such as letters and telegrams. Under winning number cases,
numbers drawn in lotteries, games of chance, also some cases of
precognition of the numbers drawn by men called up for military
service, precognition of cards drawn from a pack, winners of races
and so on.
The other headings are, I think, sufficiently clear to need no
comment.
There is perhaps one point concerning death from natural causes
which should be mentioned. There are one or two cases where the
actual cause of death was a natural one, but brought about or
intensified as the result of an accident. In these I have used my
discretion in deciding whether the accident or the illness was the
predominant cause.
Taking all the types of precognition together, the most numerous
of the incidents foreseen was death, either natural or accidental,
being 72 natural and 27 accidental. Running it very close, however,
come incidents, 70 trivial and 12 not trivial. It is, perhaps, worthy
of notice that hallucinations give a far higher ratio of precognitions
of death to those of incidents than do any of the other classes, and
this is significant (see Appendix B). This seems explicable by the
greater emotional tone involved, which may reasonably be held to
have some connection with the generation of hallucination. The
statistics of phantasms show conclusively that a state of crisis is
somehow connected casually with their occurrence, and it appears
likely that a similar nexus may exist with precognitions.
The ratio of death to incident in mediumistic cases is somewhat
lower than with the other types ;
but, as was pointed out above,
statistics in this class cannot be considered reliable.
I do not think that there are any other points in connection with
these figures which merit special mention at this stage.
A further classification has been made in which the numbers of
certain special types have been extracted. This is as follows :

134] Report on Cases of Apparent Prcrognition 57
Of these, collective dreams are more of a curiosity than of much
practical importance. Neither of the two cases which I have are of
the good class.
In the first, Proceedings, xiv. 253, Dr Howard and another student
of Columbia University, both dream on the night before the boat-
race that Columbia would win. Presumably they were all excited
about the race, so that there is nothing very remarkable in two of
them dreaming that the same crew would win. The full report of
the case reads better than my bald abstract, but it is scarcely, if at
all, beyond chance.
The second case. Journal, xiii. 118, Mr E. J. and his wife have
apparently simultaneous dreams of his mother. In Mrs J.'s dream
she is told that the mother will not live for another three months.
Fulfilled. However, the mother was 83 years of age and expected
to die at any time. Again a very poor case. In fact, neither of them
would have been mentioned but for their interest as curiosities ;
as
evidence of precognition they are almost worthless, apart from the
small additional value afforded by the fact of collectivity.
It is conceivable that collective dreams might occur owing to
telepathic suggestion from one dreamer to another, or by the opera-
tion of an external cause acting on both sleepers simultaneously, and
it would be of interest to know if any such cases, whether precogni-
tive or not, could be found.
Collective hallucinations are fairly common, so it is not surprising
that some instances should be found among precognitive cases. The
problems raised by the cases do not directly concern the matter of
precognition. Whether they are due to telepathic suggestion from
one of the percipients to the other, or to the operation of an external
agency acting simultaneously on more than one person, need not be
discussed here. The fact of collectivity, however, gives a certain
added impressiveness to the phenomenon.
Recurrent cases, whether of dream or any other type, certainly
give the impression of a persistent cause, either external or internal.
A dream repeated two or three times is more likely to be remem-
bered and noticed, and where the evidential conditions are good, the
case gains greatly in impressiveness. It is true that the hypothesis
of an illusion of memory may sometimes have a certain plausibility
here, inasmuch as it might be suggested that the dream really
occurred only once and that the apparent repetition was due to a
false memory. However when dreams occur on different nights or
at fairly long intervals on the same night, or even where the dreamer
wakes and is sufficiently impressed by the first dream to note it parti-
cularly and be perturbed by it, this hypothesis is hardly tenable.
Apart from illusion of memory these cases are of particular value
because the possibility of explanation by chance is much reduced.
58 H. F. Saltmarsh [part
It might be due to chance that I should dream of an event which is
going to happen next day, but that 1 should do so twice running is
far more unlikely.
That there should be some amount of symbolism, particularly
among the dreams and hallucinations, is only what might have been
expected. In fact, I am rather surprised that the number of such
cases is not higher. As has been conclusively shown by the investi-
gations of Freud and Jung, symbolisation plays a very important
part in dream formation. It is a device frequently resorted to by
the subliminal mind, and, as I suggested in my report on the Warren
Elliott sittings, it is part of the mechanism of transference from one
stratum of consciousness to another. The fact that it is not more
in evidence, being only 5 to 6% in dreams and 14% to 15% for
hallucinations, should be noted. It may be that this is partly due to
the symbols not being recognised as such, though in many cases the
precognition takes the form of a more or less accurate picture of the
event foreseen wherein no question of symbolism seems to be in-
volved. It is possible that were the symbolism of our dreams more
fully recognised and correctly interpreted we should find many
instances of precognition.
Warning cases have a double importance. First, as regards
evidential value and secondly for theory. I will not discuss the latter
now. As regards the former, it is, I think, clear that the fact that
the dream, impression, etc., has been regarded as a warning and in
many cases has been acted upon, lends weight to the evidence. It
shows that the percipient has been impressed by his experience
beyond the ordinary, for one's conduct is not, as a rule, governed in
any way by one's ordinary dreams.
It is therefore more likely for the account given to be full and
accurate. One of the peculiar characteristics of dreams, and to some
extent of all subliminal phenomena, is that memory of them tends
to vanish more rapidly than in the case of waking experience. Un-
less the memory be fixed and reinforced by special attention it is
likely to vanish completely in a short time.
I have, therefore, in assessing the evidential value of any case,
allowed considerable weight to instances of warning.
This is perhaps as suitable a place as any to give some account of
the methods which I adopted in assessing evidential value. I made
five classes for evidential status, as follows.
E 1. Impression recounted beforehand, confirmed by documents
or reliable independent witnesses.
E 2. Acted upon beforehand. Warning cases.
E 3. Told afterwards and confirmed by independent witnesses as
regards the telling and the details of the fulfilment.
E 4. Not told but percipient deeply impressed. i
134] Beport on Gases of Apparent Precognition 59
E 5. Mere narrative.
In addition to this classification I allotted a fiu'tlier index for the
amount of detail involved and the degree of fulfilment.
D 1. Detailed impression, fulfilled and verified.
D 2. Detailed impression, partially fulfilled.
D 3. No details.
Thus a case possessing the highest evidential value would be one
marked E 1, D 1, a case having only E 5, D 3 would be practically
valueless, most probably would be rejected as vague.
I here reproduce the notes which I made for my own guidance after
a preliminary survey, although they to some extent forestall the
discussion on theory. I do so in order that readers may know
exactly what was in my mind when classifying the cases, and may
be helped thereby to criticise my methods.
I laid down the following conditions for an ideally perfect case.
(1) It—the precognition—must have been told or recorded before
fulfilment, or acted upon in such a manner as to afford evidence of
foreknowledge.
(2) It must include details so that chance fulfilment is rendered
unlikely.
(3) The precognition must indicate fairly narrow limits of time
for fulfilment, or else must contain such details as to fix the occasion
of fulfilment, e.g. on visiting a certain place (see 8).
(4) It must be of such a nature that inference from considerably
wider knowledge and with considerably enhanced powers of infer-
ence, could not reasonably have been held to have afforded the
foreknowledge.
(5) It must be of such a nature that suggestion, whether auto-
or hetero-, conscious or unconscious, could not have brought about
the fulfilment.
(6) It must be of such a nature that the information was not in
the possession of any other person so that it could have been con-
veyed telepathically to the percipient. The information in such
cases would include the intention to perform certain actions.
(7) It must be of such a nature as to exclude hyperaesthesia of
any extent which might reasonably be considered possible.
(8) The time interval between the prevision and the fulfilment
must be sufficiently long to exclude the illusion of deja vu and suffi-
ciently short, on the other hand, to reduce the probability of chance
fulfilment to negligible proportions. This latter limit is dependent
on the circumstances of the prevision, such as the nature and amount
of the details foreseen.
Note A. In the matter of time there must be taken into account
the interval which has elapsed before the incident is reported. When
documents are forthcoming this may not be of very much importance
60 H. F. Salfmarsh [part
but documentary evidence is rare. The lapse of a considerable time
before reporting and investigation reduces the evidential value in
cases where the account depends entirely on memory. People are
liable to embroider their narratives and memory is unreliable.
Confirmatory accounts should be independent. Action taken before
fulfilment is, from some points of view, better evidence than con-
firmatory accounts.
Note B. Details are more easily given in visual premonitions,
hence dreams, visual hallucinations and crystal visions furnish the
best cases. In auditory cases, those where actual words are given in
the premonition, approximate in evidential value to the above, but
the number of details can never be so full. The number of details
is important, the evidential value rising by a function of the product
of the number and not by mere addition.
The trivial details are evidentially more valuable than broad
general features.
Incorrect details do not necessarily deduct much from evidential
value.
This concludes the preliminary discussion and I now propose to
give samples of the various classes. I have summarised the accounts
as briefly as possible in order to keep this paper within reasonable
dimensions. For fuller information readers are referred to the
volumes of Proceedings and Journal.
Dream. Natural death. Recurrent. E 3, D 1.
P. xi. 577. Lady A. dreams that she sees her uncle lying dead
by the side of the road. The body is brought to the house in a
wagon and two men, whom she recognises, carry it iipstairs. In
doing so the left hand struck the banisters. She tells the dream to
her uncle who promised not to ride unaccompanied. The dream
recurs after two years and again four years later. Fulfilled in all
details.
Hallucination. Natural death. E i, D 1.
P. V. 293. Mrs Alger sees phantasmal appearance of her mother-
in-law, followed some hours later by hallucinatory voice saying,
" Come, both of you, on the 22nd." The mother-in-law died four
days later on the 22nd. Was not known to be ill at the time of the
hallucination.
Mediumistic. Natural death. E 1, D 1.
'
P. xi. 433. Dr Suddick in a private circle for table tilting
receives prediction of the death of a Mr Chris Varis, then very ill in a
town some distance away and expected to live only a few days. His
death is predicted as going to occur in 40 days' time. Fulfilled.
134] Report on Cases of Apparent Precognition 61
At another sitting in a different honse with different sitters, one
of the sitters is given information of the death of another friend,
whom he had thought was alive at the time. This ostensible
communicator confirms the prediction concerning Varis.
Neither Varis nor those about him knew of the prophecy. i
Dream. Recurrent. Accidental death (Murder). E 1, D 1.
P. V. 324. Well known case of Mr J. Williams seeing in a dream
the murder of Mr Perceval in the House of Commons before the
event.
Dream. Accident. E 5, D 2.
J. iv. 327. This is a case of partial fulfilment. Mr H. dreams
that his friend, Mr W. M. Evans is thrown from his trap by the horse
rearing and is killed. The accident happened as foreseen in the
dream only that Mr Evans escaped death. Other details correct.
Hallucination. Course of illness. E 5, D 1.
P. xi. 446. A lady staying with a relative in Paris, while in bed,
sees hallucinatory figure resembling him but shrunken and partially
paralysed and apparently imbecile, crossing the room. He was asleep
at the time. Some time later he was attacked by creeping paralysis
and softening of the brain, and became nearly as she had seen him
in the hallucinatory vision.
Dream. Course of illness. E 1, D 1.
J. xii. 340. Mrs L. dreams that the doctor told her that her
friend Mr. C, who was very ill with pneumonia, would die on Thurs-
day at four o'clock. Her husband wakes her as she moans and cries
in -her sleep and she tells him her dream. The following Thursday
Mr C. is better and continiies to improve until the next Wednesday
when he has a heart attack. He gets over this, but has another on
Thursday and dies at a few minutes past four.
Dream. Accident. E 1, D 1.
P. xi. 489. Col. Coghill receives a letter from a friend telling him
of a dream in which she saw him lying under his horse with several
people trying to assist him. Fulfilled two days later. Letters
preserved.
Dream. Accident. Warning case. E 2, D 1.
P. xi. 497. Lady Z. dreams of driving in a street near Piccadilly
and her coachman falling off the box on to his head in the road,
crushing in his hat. Next day, wishing to go to Woolwich but
remembering her dream, she suggests to the coachman that she
should go by train. He demurs at starting at the time proposed but
62 H. F. Sallmarsh [part
says that eleven o'clock will be all right. On the return drive
Lady Z. notices the coachman leaning back on the box as she had
seen him in her dream. Memory of the dream flashes across her and
she calls to him to stop, and to a policeman standing by to catch him.
The coachman at that moment faints and falls but is caught. Had
not Lady Z. acted upon the warning of the dream, and called to the
policeman, the coachman would have fallen on his head. Thus the
warning conveyed by the dream averted the complete fulfilment.
Dream. Accident to material thing. Warning. E 2, D L
P. XI. 56 L Mr Skelton, a railway engine driver, dreams of a
collision in a station. Two days afterwards, while his train was on a
siding at that station, a goods train, being late, was passing through
on the express line. Mr Skelton heard the whistle of an express and
recognised the scene of his dream. He succeeded in flagging the
express and thus avoided the accident which he had foreseen.
Dream and Impression. Accident to material thing. Warning. El,
D3.
P. V. 335. Fran K. dreams of a fire. On waking has presenti-
ment of disaster. She urges her husband to have their securities
removed from the safe in a brewery where they were being kept, and
finally, after ten days, prevails on him to do so. About a month
later the brewery, with the safe, was totally destroyed by fixe. Frau
K. dreamed of fire on the night when the brewery was burnt down.
Dream. Trivial incident. E 1, D 1.
P. V. 345. Dream of finding a brooch on a seat in Richmond
Park. Told beforehand and fulfilled.
Dream. Trivial incident. E 1, D 1.
P. xi. 458. Dr Hy. Smith dreams of looking at a number of
transparent photographic slides. Next day a man offers to show him
some slides. He looks at them a week later and recognises those
seen in his dream.
Dream. Trivial incident. E 1, D L
P. xi. 474. Maria Manzini, Dr. Ermacora's subject, dreams of a
visit of a man trying to get subscriptions for a novel and offering
prizes. Describes the man. Dream written down next day. Ful-
filled in all details four days later.
Dream. Trivial incident. El, D 1.
P. xi. 487. Mrs Atley dreams of reading family prayers in the
hall instead of in the Chapel as her husband, the Bishop, was away.
After reading prayers she went into the dining room and saw a large
134] Report oil Lkifies of Appartiit Precognition 63
pig standing between the table and the sideboard. Tells her dream
before prayers. Fulfilled. The pig escaped from its sty while
prayers were being read.
Dream. Trivial incident. E 1, D 1.
P. xi. 488. Mrs C. dreams of seeing a monkey and being followed
by it, which terrifies her. Tells her dream to the family and her
husband recommends her to go for a walk. She does so with the
children and sees a monkey which follows her. This took place in
London where escaped monkeys are not common objects.
Hallucination. Arrival. E 1, D 1.
P. vi. 374. Anon. Hallucination of arrival of two men in a
dogcart. Fulfilled shortly after with details correct. The arrival
was unexpected and the visitors unknown. They were recognised
as the persons seen in the hallucinatory vision.
Hallucination. Arrival. E 5, D 3.
P. vi. 375. Anon. Hallucination of extra guest at dinner.
Fulfilled next day. Details correct.
Borderland. Winner of race. E 1, D 1.
P. xiv. 251. Prof. Haslam, between waking and sleeping, visual-
ises a jockey in scarlet, riding horse to win. Repeated. He does not
know anything about the horses, jockeys, or colours in the next
day's race. Tells several people beforehand. Finds jockey in scarlet
riding and backs the horse. The horse wins.
The foregoing are simply examples selected more or less at random
to illustrate the various types of cases. It is unnecessary for my
present purpose to weary the reader with the recital of a larger
number, although it would be possible to give many instances of
most of the types.
We must now turn to the consideration of the main purpose of
this inquiry, viz. the discovery of hypotheses to account for the
phenomena.
There are, first of all, four such possible hypotheses which may be
held to be the most probable explanation in certain cases. These
are, (1) Telepathy, (2) Auto-suggestion, (3) Subconscious knowledge,
(4) Hyperaesthesia.
Before discussing these in detail I should like to point out that
they are all based on mental phenomena which involve, as a general
rule, some amount of dissociation, thus linking up with what was
said earlier concerning the state of the percipient.
Cases of precognition where an explanation based on telepathy
can plausibly be put forward are for the most part arrival cases. In
this it may be held that some person connected with the arrival
64 H. F. SaUmarsh \
[part
which is to be, is thinlving of the coming event at the time the per-
cipient receives the impression and that this thought is conveyed
telepathically.
It need not, of course, be only an arrival. Any event which is
planned beforehand might be the subject matter of a precognition
of this sort. The intention to act in a certain manner may be trans-
mitted telepathically, and the percipient may receive it as an im-
pression of something about to occur or as a dream or hallucination
representing the scene as imagined. This hypotheses, while fairly
covering the simpler arrival cases such as that of a letter or visitor,
gets a little thin when stretched to include some of the more com-
plicated.
As an example of this I quote a case told to me by the percipient
some years ago. Unfortunately, it is not available for formal report,
the percipient having died some time since, so it is only of use as an
illustration and not as evidence.
The percipient, the wife of a minister, was expecting a visitor, a
brother minister from a town some distance away, to lunch. She
was sitting in a room on the first floor, overlooking the road, and
about lunch time looked out of the window and saw her visitor
walking up to the house. She recognised him perfectly and noticed
that he was dressed in a fashion very unlike his usual attire. She
rang the bell for the maid to set on the lunch and went downstairs
to the front door to admit him. On opening the door she was sur-
prised to find no one in sight. At the time of the occurrence the
visitor was at a railway station some miles away, having missed his
train. He arrived later in the day. When he arrived the percipient
saw that he was dressed in the, for him, unusual fashion which she
had noticed in the halhicinatory vision.
Now it is quite possible that while he was waiting on the station
he might have thought of himself as arriving at the door of the
house which he was to visit, but it requires some amount of stretching
of the telepathic hypotheses that the projected phantasm should
include details of his clothing. He might, of course, have been more
than usually conscious of his attire owing to its not being his ordinary
fashion, but one would expect that the phantasm would represent
his more normal appearance.
I am aware that this particular case might Ije attacked on several
grounds, such as that it is not a premonition at all, but a simple case
of mistaken recognition. I am not going to trouble to answer any
such objections as I do not cite the case as evidence, only as an
illustration.
In the following case, P. xi, 503, E 5, D 1 } the telepathic hypo-
thesis requires even more stretching. The facts are : Professor J.
^ Though tliis has to be classed E 5, 1 think it really merits a higher marking.
134] Report on Cases of Apparent Precognition 05
Thoulet, waking from sleep, thinks that he has a telegram in his
hand and goes into the room in which his friend is sleeping and says,
" You have got a little girl, the telegram says ..." He begins to
read the imaginary telegram when it vanishes and he realises that
he has been dreaming. He wrote down what he had read. Ten
days later a telegram corresponding to the one seen in the dream
actually arrives. M. Thoulet is able to recognise the words he had
seen but not read aloud.
In order to make the telepathic hypothesis cover this case we
must assume that the wording of the telegram had been decided
upon ten days before the event which it was to announce had
happened. This, though possible, seems rather unlikely, especially
as the sex of the unborn child could not have been known.
Thus we get a graduated series of cases starting from those which
the telepathic hypothesis will cover with ease, and working up to
instances which require more and more stretching.
Now, although the canons of scientific methodology may compel
us to give preference to this hypothesis on the grounds that telepathy
is an already established phenomenon, yet the fact that its applica-
bility tails off as it were rather tends to discredit it. If in the more
complex cases we find that telepathy alone cannot satisfactorily
explain the facts, and should we be successful in finding another
explanation, then I think that even in the simpler cases we should
have to bracket the two hypotheses together as alternatives. We
cannot reject telepathy in cases where it fits, because we know, or at
least most of us feel pretty well convinced, that telepathy exists.
The net result is to throw some doubt on the matter and restrain
us in our endeavours to stretch the hypothesis to cover other types
of cases.
I have made a list of the cases wherein I consider that the tele-
pathic hypothesis may reasonably be held to apply. I have included
those instances where a fair amount of stretching is necessary, such
as the one just quoted.
The result is : Dream 9 ;
Impression 9 ; Hallucination 9 ;
Mediumistic 2 ;
Crystal 1.
The next hypothesis to be discussed is that of auto-suggestion.
It is possible, of course, that hetero-suggestion might also operate
in bringing about the fulfilment of a precognition ; but so far as I
have been able to discover there is no case in those under review
where this seems reasonably plausible.
As a typical case where auto-suggestion seems a possible explana-
tion the following may be cited.
J. iv. 292-3. E4, D2. Mrs Edwards has an auditory hallucination
warning her that she will die at a certain hour. As the clock was
striking the hour she had a severe haemorrhage and very nearly died.
E
66 H. F. Saltmarsh [part
It seems plausible to suggest that the hallucination acted by auto-
suggestion to bring about the haemorrhage at that exact moment.
I do not think that there is much that need be said on this point.
We are aware of the very powerful influence which auto-suggestion
can exert, particularly in cases where there is already some patho-
logical state of the organism.
The number of the causes which I have extracted as being
possibly due to this cause is as follows : Dream 3 ;
Impression 2 ;
Hallucination 7 ; Mediumistic 1.
It may perhaps be worthy of note that the percentage is higher
with hallucinations than among the other types. This seems quite
reasonable in that hallucination, being a more exciting and notable
event than a dream or impression, would tend to be stronger in
inciting to auto-suggestion.
The next hypothesis, viz. Subconscious knowledge, is perhaps the
one which possesses the greatest possibilities of extension. On this
hypothesis the apparently supernormal precognition is reduced to
the normal type, that is to say, a prediction based on inference from
known facts and causes, only in this case they are subliminally
known. We have also to suppose in many cases a considerably
greater power of inference than is possessed by the supraliminal
mind.
It is obvious that the possible range of this hypothesis is extremely
indefinite. What limits are we to place on the possibility of sub-
hminal knowledge and inference ? Is it true, as some determinist
philosophers have held, that if we could know the exact state of
affairs down to the minutest details at any given moment, and if we
also possessed the necessary powers of calculation, we could predict
the state of affairs at any future time with complete certainty ?
And if this be true, can we assume that any human being could
possess this knowledge and these powers of calculation, whether
supra- or subliminally ?
If these suppositions be accepted, then all apparently supernormal
precognitions are simply disguised cases of normal prediction. We
have found an explanation which will cover the whole lot. As a
matter of personal opinion I doubt very much whether any such
view can be seriously entertained. I regard the necessary supposi-
tions as being so extremely far-fetched and wildly improbable, in
view of our knowledge of the human mind and its limitations, that
the question hardly merits serious discussion.
Consider, for example, the case of Mrs Atlay, P. xi. 487, of which
I have given a short summary in my list of specimen cases. If the
determinist theory be correct, all the causes, or causes of causes,
which produced the event of the pig escaping from its sty and
wandering into the dining room during prayers were in existence at
134] Report on Gases of Apparent Precogmtiort 07
the time Mrs Atlay was dreaming, and we must assume that she
somehow became aware of them. How complex this interlocking
system of causes must have been we can hardly imagine. It would
include the state of the fastening of the door of the sty, the state of
mind of the pig, if I may be allowed to speak of states of mind in
connection with pigs, also the motives which induced it first to
escape, and second to wander into the dining room. Besides all this
there would be innumerable other factors such as the absence of
anyone en route to head him off and lead him ignominiously back to
captivity, the causes of a free passage, such as open doors or window
in the dining room, etc.
Then, having acquired all these data, Mrs Atlay's subconscious
mind must have engaged in a process of calculation as a result of
which she foresaw the inevitable outcome of all the interacting
factors.
Our normal knowledge of the psychology of our fellow human
beings is insufficient to allow us to make accurately dated forecasts
of their actions except in comparatively simple cases. Our know-
ledge of the psychology of pigs is far smaller than that of human
beings. Can we reasonably suppose that our subliminal powers so
greatly transcend those of our supraliminal minds ?
There are, however, types of cases in which this hypothesis of
inference from subliminal knowledge seems plausible. They are for
the most part cases involving the precognition of states of the
organism, either predictions of the coiirse of an illness or of death
from natural causes. They are, in short, a sort of supernormal
medical prognosis.
It is clear that in such cases the cause of the precognition may be
joined to or supplemented by one or more of the other causes men-
tioned. Thus, if by inference from subliminal knowledge the per-
cipient forecasts the progress of his disease, auto-suggestion may
operate to bring about some definite happening at the exact moment
foretold. Where the prognostication concerns some other person it
may be that the knowledge on which the inference is based is
acquired telepathically from the patient, or possibly by hyperaesthe-
sia, and in such case unconscious hetero-suggestion might come into
play to produce definite results. Whether the latter phenomenon
does actually occur I cannot say. I have not been able to find any
clear indication of its presence.
As examples of cases in which this hypothesis seems plausible I
would refer to P. xi. 446 ; J. xii. 340 ; P. v. 293 ; P. xi. 443,
summarised above.
The number of cases in which I have considered that it might be
reasonably held to apply is as follows : Dream 10, Borderland 2,
Impression 5, Hallucination 19, Mediumistic 7, Crystal 1.
68 H. F. Saltniarsh [part
The last of these hypotheses, viz. hyperaesthesia, is applicable
almost entirely in cases involving an accident to some material
object. The following are typical examples.
P. xi. 418. E 2, I) 3. Anon. A lady living in a wooden house
in the Kockies, while sitting one evening in the porch, has an
hallucinatory vision of a fire in the distance. After watching for
about ten minutes she hears a faint crackling sound, and, being
disturbed by the hallucination which at the time she takes to be real,
she goes to investigate and finds her own house on fire. She is just
in time to save her child.
As lending some support to the hypothesis of hyperaesthesia it is
interesting that the same percipient experienced a second somewhat
similar occurrence. While in England she was wakened one night
from sleep by the impression of hearing her name called. On waking
she found the nightlight blazing.
P. xi. 419. E 2, D 3. C. W. Moses, engineer in charge of a train,
while driving his engine feels the impulse to stop the train when
approaching a trestle bridge. He does so and goes ahead to investi-
gate. He finds the bridge destroyed by fire, and a serious accident
is thus avoided. This might have been due to hyperaesthesia of
smell or else some difference in the noise of the wheels on the
rails.
P. xi. 421. E 2, D 3. M. H. Gray has hallucinatory vision of
flames. Investigates and finds the clothes in the laundry on fire.
Might have been hyperaesthesia of smell or hearing, although two
closed doors intervened. Where this hypothesis appears to be a
reasonable explanation the case, of course, ceases to be a true pre-
cognition, as hyperaesthesia presumes the actual existence at the
time of the event supernormally cognised.
The number of such cases is. Borderland 1, Impression 6, Hallu-
cination 4.
Taking together all the cases which have been selected as possibly
explicable by one or other of these four hypotheses we get the
following totals : Dream 22, Borderland 3, Impression 22, Hallu-
cination 39, Mediumistic 10, Crystal-gazing 2.
In making this selection I have tended to stretch the hypotheses
as far as they could reasonably be stretched. I have no doubt that
in a good many cases some people would think that I had overdone
it, but on the principle that an explanation by known causes is
better than one that postulates the unknown, I thought it right to
be as liberal as possible. If it should happen that an hypothesis is
found which can account for precognition in general, and is based on
established fact, then these categories would be subject to revision.
After deducting the cases as enumerated above we have left a
considerable residuum for which some other explanation must be
134] Report on Cases of Ajyparent Precognition 69
found. There remains 94 cases of Dream, 4 Borderland, 17 Impres-
sion, 23 Hallucination, 41 Mediumistic, 4 Crystal-gazing. This
constitutes a mass of evidence far too weighty to be set aside.
There is, of course, one general hypothesis covering all possible
types of precognition which so far has not been mentioned, viz. that
they are all due to chance coincidence. This is the view that is
generally held by the uninstructed and those who have not made an
unbiassed study of the evidence.
I have had it said to me when discussing the matter with persons
not acquainted with the subject, " Millions of people dream every
night. It is, therefore, only what might be expected that some of the
dreams should correspond with what happens during the next few
days."
There is a superficial appearance of reasonableness about this
argument when stated thus vaguely ; but I thinlc that if it be put
into more definite form it will be seen to be quite untenable. It is
true that millions of people dream every night, but the proportion
of dreams which are remembered is comparatively small, and out
of this fraction there is an even smaller proportion which exhibit the
peculiarly impressive character which so often marks the premoni-
tory dream and causes it to be recorded. We cannot have, unfor-
timately, any statistics of such dreams whereby we can arrive at an
estimate of the numbers which turn out to be false premonitions.
Still I do not think that this is essential to the argument.
Even supposing that there are millions of dreams remembered,
the number of subjects which may be dreamed about is practically
infinite. Thus the chances that any particular subject will enter
into the dream on any particular night is very small. It is of course
true that the subjects of any person's dreams are as a rule limited to
a comparatively small section of the total of the possible subjects,
being usually concerned with those things which enter his daily
experience. For example, a fairly high proportion of my own
dreams are connected with sailing and boats. But if I dream that
I am sailing in my boat and actually do so during the next few days,
I should not consider the dream premonitory. Should the dream
contain details, say that the jib halliards carried away, and should
this happen within a short time, it still would be hardly worthy of
notice, for, although jib halliards do not often carry away, at least
if you look after your gear as you should, I have known them to
do so.
Should the dream contain a combination of independent details,
none of which, perhaps, is very strikingly unusual or unlikely to
happen, and should the fulfilling event consist of the same arrange-
ment of details, then the chance hypothesis loses its plausibility, for
even if, as remarked above, the number of subjects about which
70 H. F. Saltmarsh [part
anyone is likely to drcain may be a comparatively small fraction of
the practically infinite theoretical total, yet the number of possible
combinations of these subjects is immensely great.
If then the chance that anyone will dream a particular dream on
any particular night is very small, so also is the chance that any
particular event will happen to that person during the next few
days.
In saying this I refer, of course, to a complex event. For, as in the
example quoted above, while it is quite likely that I should go sailing
once or twice in a week, it is not so likely that while sailing my jib
halliards should carry away and still more imlikely that that event
should be combined with several other similar happenings. It is
only when the apparent precognition refers to such a combination
of details that anything supernormal is suggested.
The probability that the precognition is due to chance depends
on both the separate probability of the dream being dreamed and
that of the event occurring within a reasonably short interval.
Where these separate probabilities are represented, as I have
endeavoured to show, by very small fractions, the probability of
chance fulfilment becomes infinitesimally small. The time element
is, of course, important, and I have, therefore, rejected any cases
where the lapse of time between the dream, impression, etc., and
the fulfilment appears excessive.
What I have said of dreams applies equally to impressions, but
when we come to consider hallucinations the argument is very much
stronger owing to the rarity of these phenomena.
In this discussion we have been considering the probability of
precognition of events of a usual and commonplace character, but
in many cases the event foreseen is not usual.
Consider again the case quoted of Mrs Atlay and the pig in the
dining room. How often does one dream of seeing so imusual a
sight ? It must be a very rare occurrence. On the other hand, how
often does one find pigs—I refer, of course, to the non-human
variety—in dining rooms ? This again is not a usual happening.
And when we combine the additional details of time, i.e. after
reading prayers, and place, i.e. between the table and the sideboard,
we get a combination of circumstances such that chance seems to be
excluded for all practical purposes.
Now if this incident stood alone, we might perhaps say that it
was an extremely curious coincidence and leave it at that. But it
does not stand alone, we have a large number of cases to match it.
Dreams of being followed by a monkey are surely very rare, at any
rate for persons living in this country, and the event of being so
followed must be almost unique in London where loose monkeys are,
to say the least, unfiimiliar objects.
134] Report on Cases of Apparent Precognition 71
I could go on citing cases but I think it is unnecessaiy. The
hypothesis of chance cannot possibly be held to cover all the cases
reported.
I have classed as non-precognitive a certain number of cases where
it had appeared plausible, but there still remains so large a residuum
where it is wildly improbable, that I have no hesitation in rejecting
it as a possible explanation.
There is another hypothesis which is sometimes put forward, viz.
that the precognitions are due to illusions of memory. In certain
cases, where no records have been made and where no one has been
told of the dream etc. before fulfilment, this explanation might be
possible ; but when records have been made or an account given
before fulfiJment, it seems inapplicable. We should have to suppose
that there was illusion of memory not only as regards the pre-
cognition and its fulfilment but also as regards the times of making
the records or giving the accounts. Not only must the percipient
have experienced illusion of memory but also all those who give
confiimatory evidence. In many of what I have called warning
cases, of which there are some 34 all told, some action has been
taken as a consequence of the premonition. It seems hardly likely
that in so many cases the illusion of memory should apply to these
actions as well as to the precognition itself.
Illusion of memory may possibly account for a few of the poorer
cases, but it would be to discredit too profoundly the value of human
testimony to suppose that it occurred in all the large number of well
evidenced cases which we possess.
I do not think it necessary to spend time in discussing fraud, bad
reporting, inaccurate observation and all the rest of the stock in
trade of the sceptic of a certain type. Fraud is obviously out of the
question in so large a mass of spontaneous phenomena. As regards
the rest, the cases were all drawn from the Proceedings or Journal
of the Society and this in itself is some guarantee that these points
have not been overlooked. For a case to have been printed it must
have reached the evidential standard laid down by the Society ;
there may have been a few lapses from this standard, but on the
whole it may be taken to have been observed.
Reading the reports of the cases themselves together with the
confirmatory evidence published amply supports this view.
After prolonged study I have no hesitation in afiirming that pre-
cognitions do occur. In doing so I have the support of many
authorities in psychical research. Should the reader feel any doubt
remaining, I would refer him to Prof. Chas. Richet's excellent little
book, UAvenir et la Premonition.
We have now come to the end of the hypotheses which have from
time to time been put forward to account for these facts, and we
72 H. F. Saltmarsh [part
find ourselves left with a. very considerable mass which none of them |
will cover. Can we find a tentative hypothesis or must we leave it, -
as Prof. Richet does, unexplained ? !
It is, perhaps, a temerarious enterprise to venture in where he
has abstained, yet in spite of this I propose to make the attempt.
If I fail and my suggestion be held to be untenable, at least one more
alternative will have been cleared out of the way and the path ren-
dered less obstructed for future explorers.
Now what is the central basic fact common to all cases of pre-
cognition ?
When I observe an event which happens in my presence my mind
somehow or other comes into conscious contact with that event.
How it does so is a matter concerning which much controversy has
arisen, and there are a number of different theories of perception.
It would be out of place to attempt to discuss these here, even were
I competent to do so. All we need say is that a cognitive relation
is set up between the event and my mind.
The difference between normal cases and those of precognition is
that in the latter the event does not happen in my presence, that
is to say it is not an event in my present but in the futirre. Somehow
or other a cognit've relation is set up between my mind and an event
which, as we say, has not yet happened.
It is unfortunate that this enquiry leads us into some of the very
worst morasses of metaphysical speculation. I would willingly have
avoided adventuring into this perilous region could I have done so,
but if the attempt to explain precognition is to be made, some ex-
cursion therein is inevitable. I will make it as short as possible.
Now it is held by some authorities that the future is non-existent.
What exactly is meant by the word " exist " I will not consider,
but in view of the evidence before us I suggest, although I feel
considerable trepidation in doing so, that these authorities are mis-
taken, for how can I set up a cognitive relation with the non-
existent ? It is equivalent to postulating a relation which contains
only one term. Yet unless we dismiss the entire mass of evidence
which remains uncovered by the alternative hypotheses discussed
above, this relation actually occurs. I argue, therefore, that the
future exists now in some way, and may be accessible to my con-
sciousness under certain circumstances.
It has been held by some writers. Prof. Richet for example, that
the logical consequence of this position is that the entire future is
completely determined. Such a consequence of complete deter-
mination would entail the surrender of freedom of choice with all its
metaphysical and ethical implications. For, they argue, if we can
foresee a future event, that event must exist in its entirety and can-
not be altered by any action of ours in the present.
134] Report on Cases of Apparent Precognition 73
But even if we accept this argument (which, for reasons which I
will try to explain later, I do not) the phenomena of precognition
such as we have before us do not warrant us logically to infer com-
plete universal determination.
All that we know is that a few future events have been subject to
precognition. We are not entitled to argue thereform that all events
whatsoever could have been foreseen.
No one denies that some amomit of determination of the future
obtains ; if I release the trigger of a properly constructed and loaded
Mills bomb, that action in those c'rcumstances will determine an
explosion at that place after a few seconds.
It may be that one of the indispensable conditions of the occur-
rence of a precognition is the complete determination of the event
foreseen, that is to say, only those port-'ons of the future which are
already fixed can be foreseen.
In order to prove universal determination we should have to show
that every event whatsoever could be the subject of precognition,
and this, of course, we cannot do. It is true that those events which
we have actually formd to be the subject of precognition appear to
differ in no observable single respect from any other events, that is
to say they seem to be a fair sample (with the possible exception
that death has rather more than its share, which, however, is pro-
bably susceptible of a perfectly simple reasonable explanation).
But although we can detect no difference in general character
between the events which have been foreseen and those which have
not been, so that we must admit that we can see no reason why, if
the former have been the subject of supernormal precognition, the
latter might not be so also, many essential characteristics are hidden
from us and notably the characteristic of being completely deter-
mined or not. We can in some cases feel pretty sure that an event
has been completely determined, though these are for the most part
relatively simple and, as it were, self-centred events, but where all
the multifarious conditions and influences of the environment
impinge on it we can never be sure that we have allowed for all
relevant factors. On the other hand, we can never say with cer-
tainty that an event was not completely determined.
Could these questions be settled definitely it would put an end to
the age-old controversy between the upholders of free-will and the
determinists. If observation carried on over a thousand years has
been unable to settle the matter we may be fairly confident that it
is because the fact is not observable.
Until, then, we can show that all events whatsoever are theoreti-
cally susceptible of becoming subjects of precognition the argument
for universal determination fails.
There are two sides to the question of precognition. First, how
74 H. F. SaUnmrsh [PARI'
we can come to know a future event, and second, the mode in which
the future can be held to exist.
In putting forward my suggested hypothesis I do not for a moment
suppose that it is a complete explanation or even that it represents
how things actually happen. It is merely a suggestion of a possible
mode of looking at the phenomena based on an analogy with an
established psychological doctrine.
We take our stand firmly on the empirically established fact that
apparently supernormal precognitions do occur, and that they imply
that conscious contact is sometimes made with future events. There
may be an explanation of this phenomenon of which we have and
can have no conception under the limitations imposed by the
finiteness of our minds and the essential relativity of all our know-
ledge, but if we can find a tentative hypothesis based on other
empirically established facts, that is all we can hope for ; and it is
a step worth the taking. We are always at liberty to retrace our
steps. :

It is clear that the crux of the whole thing is Time.
We must distinguish between two sorts of time, or rather between
two different conceptions of it, viz. the mathematician's and physi-
cist's time and psychological time. The former is admittedly an
abstraction ; it consists of point-instants having no magnitude but
only temporal position ; it has no more real existence than the
mathematical point or line.
Psychological time is time as experienced.
Strictly speaking, of course, time is never actually experienced.
What is really the object of experience is change, i.e. events taking
place. Time is an abstraction from change.
With mathematician's time we have no concern. Its proper place
is in physical science, and in its proper place it acts as a well behaved
abstraction should act. Its conduct is not, perhaps, quite so fault-
less as is that of some other mathematical abstractions, but that is
no concern of ours. Unfortunately the mathematician's concept of
time has to some extent influenced our ordinary ideas, and these
should, of course, be formed solely on our experience, i.e. psycho-
logical time.
Most people have very hazy notions on the subject ; in fact, its
inherent difiiculty and familiarity renders the ideas of even the
clearest thinkers rather nebulous. For the average person who has
not thought about or studied time, I imagine that the definition
implied in the hymn, " Time, like an ever-rolling stream, bears all
its sons away," is more or less unconsciously adopted. As a defi-
nition it is obviously useless ; as a description it is inaccurate.
Time does not roll—abstractions don't. Events, if you like to put it
that way, may roll.
134] Report on Gases of Ajjpareut Precognition 75
Coucomitantly with this idea of time as a flowing stream, another
and conflicting one is ordinarily held. Time is thought of as a sort
of pseudo space, stretching out before and behind, wherein events
are located ; we pass along a path in this pseudo space, the point
at which we are being the present moment.
It is over this idea of time that the mathematician's concept is
apt to exercise a misleading influence.
Let us endeavour to thrust aside these notions, and rest solely on
actual experience ; that is to say, experience of change or of an
event taking place.
We must distinguish between two different types of experience
of change ;
first, that of an event actually taking place before our
eyes as it were, and second, that of an event having taken place.
In the first the experience is direct and immediate, as when we
actually see an object move or change in some way ; in the second
we infer change by comparing our immediate perception with our
memory of another perception of the same object.
For example, look at a watch ;
you see the second hand actually
move, the hour hand appears to be stationary ; but if you look again
in half an hour's time, you infer that the hour hand was moving
because you see that it has changed its place.
We look at the watch in what we call our present.
Now if we perceive an event actually occurring, that present must
have some duration. Were it a mathematical point-instant having
no dimension, change could not occur within it. There is no room
inside a point.
Perception, whatever else it may be, involves a state of con-
sciousness, and a state of consciousness must possess some duration.
If it vanished the moment it occurred, we could not be conscious.
Moreover, it cannot be denied that our consciousness extends over
a certain length of duration, and if this be so it cannot be made up
of point-instants having no length. If our present moment has no
length of duration, it must be separated from the present moment
which just preceded it by a gap having length of duration, as other-
wise the two moments would coincide ; thus all duration would be
compressed into a single moment or point-instant.
The idea that our experienced duration is due to the persistence
of memory of past point-instants is clearly untenable. We should
have to picture the stream of consciousness as consisting of a series
of flashes ;
flashes, moreover, which are so rapid that they occupy
no duration ; between the flashes are blank periods. If the experi-
ence of change actually occurring be psychologically the same as
that of change having occurred, which is what the memory theory
implies, each instantaneous flash must not only include an act of
perception, but also an act of memory and an inference from the
76 H. F. SaUmmsh [part
two. This seems rather a. lot to pack into a point-iustant, wherein
admittedly there is no room to pack anything.
It is true that we cannot understand perhaps how duration can
come to us, as it were, in lumps, but neither can we understand how
it can come in point-instants having no duration. When the choice
between two inexplicables is presented, I think that we are bound to
accept that one which is in accord with experience rather than that
which rests on abstractions.
I need labour the point no further ; that our present moment has
a definite duration is pretty generally accepted by psychologists.
It is known as the doctrine of the specious present. There is a
question which immediately presents itself, viz., does this specious
present include past alone, future alone, or both past and future ?
Some authorities have held the first view, others the third, but I do
not know of any who have held the second. Were I called upon to
choose, I should adopt the view that both past and future are
included within the specious present, but I consider that the question
is really meaningless, being based on the illegitimate hypostatisation
of an abstraction.
If I talk of an event as being in the past or in the future, I require
some " present " in reference to which that event is past or future.
Now the only present of which I have any experience embraces a
slab of duration. All the parts of it are present. I can, in imagina-
tion, cut it up into slices, and one slice may precede another, but it
is quite an arbitrary matter which slice I take as the actual, or as I
prefer to call it, the fictitious present. If I wish to call one particular
slice past and another future, I must place my fictitious present
somewhere between them. But what grounds can I have for select-
ing the slice which is to be my present moment ? The whole idea of
a fictitious present is due, in my opinion, to the influence of that
abstraction, mathematician's time.
Moreover, unless the slice of duration which I select as my ficti-
tious present has no magnitude, i.e., is a point-instant, the question
of past and future within its limits applies just as much to it as to
the whole of the specious present. Yet point-instants never enter
into my experience ;
they are abstractions and exist only qua
abstraction.
It may be objected that an event occupying a certain duration
can be cut up into any number of slices and that each particular
slice will occupy its own particular slice of duration and no other.
Further, that there is no limit to the number of slices into which we
can cut it up.
It is true that we can do so in imagination, yet even so we never
arrive at a slice having no duration.
It is a form of the old paradox of the flying arrow. The paradox
134] Report 0)1 Cases of Apparent Precognition 11
arises only when we deal with abstractions, viz., a mathematical
point on the arrow, a mathematical point in space and a mathe-
matical point-instant in time. If we abstain from abstraction even
in only one respect, say we consider the arrow as a whole, the paradox
vanishes.
In making these abstractions does not imagination outrun possi-
bility ? The facts on which the quantum theory of physics is based
show that so far as certain natural phenomena are concerned, there
is a limit beyond which this cutting-up process cannot go.
Might I suggest, with the utmost deference as becomes the humble
layman, that something like the quantum principle applies to space-
time ?
However this may be, it is a question for the physicist. As
regards psychological time, experience presents it to us as a contin-
uum, but as a continuum which will only cut up into lumps of a
minimum size. How and why this is so I do not profess to under-
stand ; it is one of those matters which, like the quantum principle
and many other things in modern physics, has to be accepted, as
Prof. Alexander says, " with natural piety".
There is, of course, a mode in which I may reasonably speak of
events as being past or future ;
my specious present covers a com-
paratively short length of duration, and events which are located
outside of it are either past or future from its point of view. Also
suppose that I have a specious present extending from t to t' , and
another person has one from T to i to t' to T' , then from my point
of view events in the period T to t in the other man's present would
be past and those in t' to T' would be future.
There is a further point to be considered. All the events occupy-
ing the specious present are not presented with equal clearness.^
This may be represented in a diagram. Let the horizontal line repre-
sent duration and the vertical coordinate the degree of clearness of
Fig. 1.
presentation. Then we should get a curve which would represent
the consciousness during the specious present. It might take the
form A (Fig. 1), in which case an event located near to t' would be
presented with a smaller degree of clearness than one situated mid-
1 1 use the term " clearness " in a very special sense. It is by no means
ideal for the purpose, but I cannot think of another. It is obvious that a
sensuous presentation may be either clear or dim quite irrespective of its
position in the specious present, but this has nothing to do with its clearness
in the special sense in which I have used that word.
78 H. F. Saltmarsh [part
way between t and t' . In all succeeding diagrams t is to be under-
stood as being towards the past and t' towards the future.
As the specious presents succeed one another the clearness of
presentation in each will grow to a maximum and then gradually
decrease to zero ; the succession of specious presents would, in
reality, be due to the fact that every event which is perceived is
perceived throughout a finite time with continually varying degrees
of clearness which eventually diminishes to zero.
Or the curve might take the form B (Fig. 2), which implies that
when an event first comes within a specious present, it is perceived
with maximum clearness which gradually diminishes to zero.
Fig. 2.
There are obviously other possible variants, such as
Fig. 4.
but for purposes of this enquiry these need not be discussed. The
point at issue is whether the degree of clearness at i! is minimal,
or whether the presentation to consciousness springs into being
fully grown or at any rate with a substantial magnitude. I do not
think that introspective observation will help us in this matter, and
if we are to choose between the two, it can only be a tentative choice
based on general grounds.
It might be argued that diagram B represents the act of perception
as instantaneous, i.e., as occupying no duration and thus occurring
with infinite speed. As a general rule, infinite speeds are looked upon
with suspicion. We are much more ready to accept gradual growth.
Taken as a whole, the plan of nature seems to have been drawn
with a soft pencil, or perhaps even with a brush. Mathematical
lines and points are introduced only by the mind using its faculty
of abstraction. We are more accustomed to soft curves and flowing
lines than to sharp angles and hard edges.
It must be admitted, however, that these considerations are not
decisive, but we can say that diagram A is, at least, as plausible as
diagram B.
This being so, I propose to assume that the curve is somewhat in
the form shown in diagram A, in so far, at any rate, that the angles
134] Rejwrt on Cases of Apparent Precognition 79
at t and t' are always less than right angles. There may be sharp
fluctuations at any point of the curve, but with these I am not at
present concerned. All that is necessary for my hypothesis is that
as one approaches t' there is a gradual diminution of the coordinates,
and not a sharp drop to zero.
I admit that this is an assumption, but I claim that it is legitimate.
Though the theory of precognition which I am about to suggest
requires that it be made, it could be stated on the basis of diagram
B, but it would require the help of some rather cumbrous and un-
gainly expedients.
The diagrams above represent a single specious present. The
actual fact is, of course, that there is a succession of specious pres-
ents, either as a continuous change, i.e., one merging into another
by infinitesimal degrees, or else a discontinuous series. I do not
attempt to decide which of these two alternatives is correct. To
do so would involve the discussion of some of the most recondite and
difficult problems of metaphysics. However, a decision on the point
is fortunately not required for the present purpose, but as it is
impossible to represent continuous change in diagrams, I shall, in
what follows, show the series of specious presents as discontinuous,
with the proviso that it is only to be taken as a symbolic representa-
tion for the sake of convenience, and not as implying any acceptance
of the view that they are really discontinuous.
There is, however, one point on which I must insist, viz., that if it
be a discontinuous series, the succeeding terms overlap to some
extent. This is, I think, in accordance with experience. The repre-
sentation in diagram of the series of specious presents will therefore
take somewhat the following form
Fig. 5.
I can now state my tentative theory of supernormal precognition.
I suggest that the specious present of the subliminal ^ mind is of
I I use the term subliminal mind in all that follows, because it is the one
most familiar to students of psychical research and conveys the meaning I
require. I wish, however, to make it quite clear that I do not intend thereby
to express my opinion as to its nature or status. All that I postulate is that
it is a region, normally cut off from ordinary consciousness by a threshold,
wherein events take place, events which, even if they are not identical in
character with those of the supraliminal mind, are of an analogous nature.
Whether the subliminal can properly be termed a mind, I do not attempt to
say. Possibly it is part of what Dr Broad in his Mind and its Place in Nature
calls the psychical factor and to which he denies the term mind.
80 H. F. iSaUmarsh [part
longer duration than that of the supraliminal, so that some events
which are in the present of the subliminal would appear to be either
past or future from the point of view of the supraliminal.
Dr C. D. Broad, to whose generous help and criticism I owe a great
debt, which I hereby acknowledge, has pointed out to me that this
is an inadequate statement of my theory, and has very kindly
supplied the following accurate account.
" There is a one-to-one correlation between the series of supra-
liminal specious presents in a given mind and a series of subliminal
specious presents in the same mind. Any term of the latter series
overlaps in time the corresponding term of the former, extending
further backwards into the past and further forwards into the future
than the corresponding supraliminal specious present."
(I wish to make it absolutely clear that the assistance which Dr
Broad has so kindly given me does not imply that he endorses my
suggestion or is at all prepared to accept my tentative theory.) This
theory may be represented in diagram as follows :
The line A-B represents the threshold between the supraliminal
and the subliminal, the supraliminal specious present from t to t'
has a corresponding subliminal specious present which extends from
T to T'. Similarly, the succeeding specious present t, t' ,
corresponds
with the subliminal T, T'
.
If th<? flowing curve of diagram A (Fig. 1) be not allowed, and
that of Fig. 2 insisted upon, I think the theory can still be rep-
resented in diagram. It would be somewhat as follows :
The ungainly features of which I spoke are the sharp angles where
the vertical line from I' changes to the curve of the subliminal.
However, as there is already one sharp angle necessitated by the
134] Report on Gases of A'pparent Precognition 81
theory, I cannot see that anyone can reasonably object to another
being inserted.
The contents of the supraliminal and subliminal minds, in so
far as they are presented events, may be shown as follows :

are presented to the subliminal only,
We may say, therefore,
that for the supraliminal mind x^, x^, Xq are present events, x^ and
past, Xg, Xg and x-^q future. For the subliminal all the events
from to x^^ are present. I have in this diagram shown only one
specious present, as it would have made it too confusing to have
shown all the overlapping curves, but it is easy to see how it would
look if they were filled in.
There is one point which must be mentioned, viz., that it is poss-
ible that an event, say x^, which was presented only to the subliminal
in one specious present, might reach the supraliminal in a succeeding
one.
Let us now see how we can represent a supernormal precognition,
and for this purpose we will assume a fictitious case. At twelve
noon, that is to say within the specious present of my supraliminal
mind in which the striking of noon by my clock is presented to me,
I have a supernormal precognition of an event which happens at
6 p.m. on the same day. The first diagram is as follows :
6 p.m.
A B
\ s
Fig. 9.
Here the first curve shows the specious present in which the striking
of noon is presented. This is represented by the line from 'N. The
second curve is the specious present in which the striking of 6 p.m.
is presented, or woiild be presented if the spatial conditions are
favourable. In the first curve the event x is present to the sub-
liminal only, for obviously while that curve is in being the second
82 H. F. Sallmarsh [part
has not yet occurred. But in the second specious present, viz., that
at 6 p.m., X is presented to the supraliminal. That is to say, it is
experienced in the normal way.
Now my hypothesis suggests that the subliminal presentation of
X in the first curve is somehow or other transmitted to the part of
the curve above the line A, B.
This might be represented as follows. I show only the first curve,
as this diagram represents the state of affairs at noon.
noon
N X
Fig. 10.
The dotted line represents the supernormal transmission of the sub-
liminal presentation of x through the threshold to the supra-
liminal. When 6 p.m. arrives x is normally presented in the spec-
ious present at that moment, and this brings about the verification
of the precognition.
All, therefore, that is required for my hypothesis to account for a
supernormal precognition is that the specious present of the sub-
liminal should extend sufficiently to cover the actual event, and that
there should be a means of transmission to the supraliminal. That
which is a precognition for the supraliminal is only a cognition for the
subliminal.
Stated thus, these may not seem to be very extravagant demands
for an hypothesis designed to account for so bizarre and puzzling
a phenomenon as supernormal precognition. We know that the
specious presents of the individual vary in length under the influence
of fatigue, drugs, and probably concentration of attention. More-
over, it is likely that different individuals normally have specious
presents of different lengths. It seems, therefore, not a very great
leap to suppose that the supraliminal mind should differ from the
subliminal in a similar way, but to a greater extent.
As regards the second requirement, viz., means of transmission
through the threshold, we are in a similar position. That is to say,
all we need to postulate is an extension of a process which we already
know to exist. It is generally admitted that passage through the
threshold does to some extent occur normally, as for example, in
dreams, the mechanism employed frequently includes the use of
symbolism ; moreover there is ample evidence of supernormal
13-t] Report ow Cases of AjJj^arenl PrecoyiiUion 83
transmission ;
e.g., in the cases of hyperaesthesia. This is usually
accompanied by, or occurs during, states of dissociation. It may
not be correct to say that the subliminal perception itself is trans-
mitted, though in some cases this appears to be so. It would,
perhaps be better to restrict ourselves to the statement that the
knowledge acquired by the subliminal perception is conveyed to the
supraliminal.
In these non-precognitive cases of transmission through the
threshold the events concerned lie in that portion of the subliminal
specious present which coincides with that of the supraliminal. A
diagram will make this clear.
The events, subliminal perception of which may be transmitted to
the supraliminal, lie between t and T'.
All that is required, therefore, for my hypothesis is that we should
deny to these events any special privilege in the matter of passage
through the threshold. All the events lying between a and /3 are
present to the subliminal. Is there any obvious reason why a certain
section of them should possess any special privilege simply from the
fact of their position relative to the supraliminal specious present ?
If we admit that the mathematical present moment is an ab-
straction which has no real existence, an admission which, it must
be confessed, may be easy enough to make verbally, but is very
difficult to embrace whole-heartedly with all its implications, I
cannot see that there is any ontologcal difference between the
various events which are present to the mind, whether supra- or
subliminally, such as would confer this special privilege. I can offer
no hypothesis as to how the subliminal mind establishes the cogni-
tive relation, or, as I have put it, comes into conscious contact with
the events within its specious present. It may be by an act of per-
ception similar in character to ordinary perception, or it may be
that the normal senses are specialised cases of a general faculty of
knowing or presenting objects to consciousness. Each sense in
operation would then be this general faculty working through and
canalised by a physical mechanism whereby it takes on its own
specific characteristics and becomes subject to its own peculiar
limitations. On that level of the subliminal mind which lies furthest
A

84 H. F. Sallmartik [fart
away from the threshold the general faculty of knowing may operate
directly, and not through any physical mechanism. It would be
pure psychical knowing, but what it would be like I cannot conceive.
Possible telepathy and clairvoyance may be examples of it.
In order that knowledge thus acquired may be transmitted to the
supraliminal, it would have to be translated into terms which that
part of the mind can understand ; that is to say, visual, auditory,
etc.
No weight, however, can be rested on this suggestion. Neverthe-
less, I think we may safely say that, whatever the real facts may be,
the subliminal mind operates in some fashion other than through
the normal senses.
When we turn to the mode of passage from the subliminal to the
supraliminal we find an equally unsatisfactory state of ignorance.
We do not know how the transfer is made eA^en in normal cases ;
we only know that it occurs and that it tends to occur more freely
in cases of dissociation.
There is one minor point which may be mentioned here. I noted
earlier that there was a rather surprisingly low percentage of exam-
ples of symbolism in supernormal precognitions. We know from
the work of the psycho-analysts that in cases of normal passage
through the threshold symbolism is freely employed, and I suggest
that the relatively low percentage of symbolism found in super-
normal precognitions is due to the fact that the normal mechanism
of passage through the threshold is not as a rule employed.
There is one fmal point to be considered, viz., what is the extent
of this subliminal conscious contact with the future ?
In Fig. 9 I showed the curve of consciousness meeting the line of
duration at a point a little way ahead of the specious present. This
would represent the degree of clearness of presentation as reduced
to zero ;
that is to say, conscious contact as ceasing altogether.
There are, however, three other alternatives. First, the curve
might end abruptly before meeting the line of duration thus
Fig. 12.
This I regard as highly imlikely. It does not seem reasonable to
suppose that the causes, whatever they may be, which bring about a
gradual approach of the two lines over the rest of their length should
undergo so sudden and profound a change.
134] Report on Cases of Ajyparenf Prccognifion 85
The second is that the line of consciousness approaches the line of
duration asymptotically ; that is to say, approaches ever nearer to
it without ever actually meeting it.
The third alternative, which is the one which I am inclined to
prefer, is that the line of consciousness is parallel to that of duration,
and the curve is in the line representing the threshold. It would be
thus :
The coordinate of clearness as regards the subliminal mind would
be constant throughout. The gradation of clearness of presentation
which is actually observed in the specious present of the supra-
liminal would then be shown by the vertical distance between the
hues of consciousness and the threshold in the loop t to t'.
In all probability the actual facts are far more complex than
anything which can be represented in a diagram. For example, the
threshold is almost certainly not a sharp division between two homo-
geneous sections of the mind. There may be, I should say probably
there are, several thresholds, or else there is one threshold which
would be represented as a wide belt of gradually increasing density.
We have a little evidence to guide us in this matter of the length
of the subliminal specious present. Precognitions of events weeks
or even months ahead are fairly common. We have several quite
good cases which stretch over years. Now if the conscious contact
which the subUminal mind makes with the future can extend for a
period of years, there seems to be no particular reason why it should
not extend indefinitely. If the length of the contact is limited at all,
I feel that it must be comparable in length with that of the supra-
liminal mind, i.e., the normal specious present.
K the curve of consciousness approaches the line of duration
asymptotically, then the degree of clearness of presentation would
diminish rapidly at first, the rate of diminution getting slower and
slower as we get further away from the present.
There is one fact in the evidence which may be cited in support
of this view, viz., that the precognitions of trivial events are as a
rule only a short time before the fulfilment. The longer the shots,
the fewer the details.^ However, this is susceptible of another
explanation.
^ Case P. xi. 577, summarised on page 61), is an exception to this rule, nor
is it the only one.
Fig. 13.
86 H. F. Saltmarsh [part
It must be admitted that tho implications of this hypothesis are
very serious and may land us in considerable difficulties as regards
our conception of time. However, there seems to be a conflict
between the facts on which the doctrine of the specious present is
based and our ordinary conception of time. It may be that the
doctrine of the specious present may be rejected, but if so, some other
means of accounting for the facts must be found.
I suggest, then, that we must revise our ordinary ideas of the
nature of time, however difficult may be the task and however
unsatisfying the result. That this is no novel demand the history
of metaphysical thought since Kant clearly shows, and those who
are familiar with MacTaggart's great work. The Nature of Existence,
will already be prepared, if not to accept it, at least to regard it as
within the sphere of reasonable discussion.
Briefly, my own personal ideas on the subject, for what they are
worth, are as follows : I accept MacTaggart's view of the unreality
of time and change in so far as sequences of completely determined
events are concerned, but I hold, in disagreement with him, that
there are non-determined events, such as events arising from free-
will, which exhibit true change and therefore are subject to true
time. But in all sequences of events, whether subject to true time
or not, there is temporal order or location ; that is to say, if A
causes B, and B caiises C, B will always lie bewteen A and C. In
other words, A is and always was and will be earlier than B, and
C is, was and will be later. This conception of temporal location
must be accepted as a fundamental feature of experience and held
along with, but quite distinct from, the conception of true time.
That it is a difficult conception to grasp and hold, I freely admit, but
it seems to me to be necessitated by the facts, and mere difficulty of
conception is, or should be, no bar.
This is not the place to enter upon any discussion of the grounds
of this opinion. I may say, however, that I reached it from general
metaphysical arguments and not from the consideration of the
phenomena of the specious present and supernormal precognition.
That these phenomena seem to require it, or something like it, for
their explanation, appears to me to lend considerable support to the
hypothesis.
It might seem at first sight that my theory implies that a future
event, meaning thereby an event which does not yet exist, can
exercise a causative influence on the present. This is obviously im-
possible, for non-existence cannot exercise a causative influence. But
my suggestion is that the event which is the object of a precogni-
tion is not future in this sense ; it already exists in the present of the
subliminal. It is future only in the sense that it is temporally located
later than events which are in the present of the supraliminal.
134] Re]3ori on Cases of Apimrent Precognition 87
We must now turn to the other side of th(^ matter.
I have suggested that the fact that precognitions occm' shows
that the subliminal mind is in conscious contact with a section of
duration lying ahead of the normal specious present ; that is to
say, what we ordinarily call the future.
If this be so, the future exists now in some sense. Can we form
any idea of the manner in which it exists ?
I have already argued, unless we can show that all future events
whatsoever are theoretically capable of being subjects of precogni-
tion, we cannot claim that the few scattered cases of which we have
evidence prove the theory of universal determination.
But inability to prove a fact does not justify us in denying it. If
all events are completely determined, that is to say, if freewill is
an illusion, then, in my opinion, MacTaggart is right in denying
reality to time. All events are coexistent in reality. We call one
past and another future simply because of their temporal location
with regard to another event which we call present, and our reason for
selecting that particular event is that it is included within our spec-
ious present. That is to say, it is presented to my consciousness with
sufficient clearness to pass the threshold dividing the subliminal from
the supraliminal.^ Now obviously, clearness of presentation is a com-
pletely non-temporal feature, so that it is really a very poor sort of
reason, when one comes to think of it, for fixing the present moment.
I do not for a moment suppose that this theory of the unreality of
time in determined sequences will be acceptable to everyone, but
the matter can be considered apart from any theories. We say that
an event happens and that it happens in the present. Well then,
what is it that happens when a completely determined event
happens ? Being completely determined by events and conditions
which already exist, and thus being incapable of being changed in
any way, its actual happening seems to be reduced to the level of a
mere formality. The happening adds nothing to it. It is true that
it may be presented in my supraliminal specious present while it is
happening, provided that conditions for observation are favourable.
But if this be the only difference between present, past and future,
when no observer is available, happening is reduced to a mere formal
possibility of being observed. I admit that these considerations are
not conclusive, because the formal possibility may depend in part
upon a real time relation. The nature of time can be investigated
only by metaphysical examination.
^ I do not wish it to be assumed that I consider clearness of presentation to
be the only condition necessary for the passage through the threshold. There
may be, and if Freud is right there are, others. Passage may be denied by the
endo-psychic censor on account of the inacceptability of the idea. But 1
think that as regards the presentation of events, clearness is probably the main
factor.
I
1
88 H. F. Salfmarsh [pabt
1 ha ve nirntioned the above merely to show that the thing is not
j
so obvious and transparent as it may seem at first sight. So far we \
have been discussing completely determined sequences, but there
are grounds, for example those based on ethical considerations, which ,
render universal determinism unacceptable to many of us. Every- !
body assumes for practical purposes that some degree of freedom of
choice exists. Many people, including philosophers of the highest
rank, accept it theoretically as well. Let us assume that we possess
some degree of freewill ; that is to say, that we can intervene to some
extent in the course of events and exercise a directional influence
over them. I am not going to discuss the grounds for this assump-
tion ;
they have been discussed ad nauseam for the past thousand
years, so it is unlikely that I shoidd be able to add anything of
interest.
If we are able to intervene and guide the course of events, it
follows that they must be to some extent what I may call plastic ;
that is to say, they are not frozen to rigidity.
Now the temporal locus of the operation of freewill appears, on
the face of it, to be the present, that is the specious present, not the
fictitious present.
It may be objected that the doctrine of the specious present is
all very well for psychology and for knowing about things, but that
when it comes to the actual doing of things, to the happening of the
events themselves, it really " won't wash".
Can things happen in a time that is actually as the psycho-
logist's time appears to be ?
I freely admit that I cannot conceive how this may be so, but
then I can no more easily conceive how the alternative, i.e., mathe-
matician's time, can be real. But I have actual experience of
psychologist's time, while the other is admittedly an abstraction.
Thus I prefer to accept the view based on experience, even if I
cannot understand it. Moreover, arguments similar to those used
in the case of the specious present may be adduced in this matter as
well.
An act of freewill must have some duration, otherwise it would
cease to exist at the very moment that it started. That is to say,
it would not exist at all. Also, it must impinge on events, if I may
put it that way, over a definite length of duration for the same
reason. The cutting edge of a tool, however sharp, must have some
thickness ; it cannot be a mathematical line.
I thiiik that I need labour the point no further, but will take it as
established that when I exercise freewill it extends over a length of
duration included within my specious present.
Now the only observable difference other than temporal location
between the various slices of the specious present is the degree of
134] Be2wrt on Cases of Apparent Precognition 89
clearness with which they tire presented to my consciousness.
Ontologically, they appear to be otherwise simihxr.
It may be that there are also degrees of what I have called
plasticity. In fact, I suggest that this is so. Still, however this may
be, some part of the period is plastic and susceptible of being
moulded to some extent by the operation of my freewill. If this is
true for the supraliminal specious present, it may be, and my theory
is that it is, true for the longer specious present of the subliminal.
The view which I would like to suggest may be pictured somewhat
as follows :
Imagine a bundle of wires or threads all running roughly parallel
to each other. You are looking at the bundle through a narrow slit
across its length so that you can see only a short section at any one
time. The slit moves along in the general direction in which the
wires run.
Not only can you see through the slit, but you can also touch the
wires through it. Some of the wires are flexible and elastic, others
rigid and immovable. You are able, therefore, to exercise a limited
control over their arrangement and relative positions.
The wires that are capable of being moved have this peculiar
property, that after the slit has passed over them they become rigid,
so that the whole bundle astern of the slit is fixed and immovable.
^
The edges of the slit are not sharply cut, but have fringes, so that
your vision is clearest about the centre and diminishes in clearness
at the edges.
The bundle of wires represents a strand of history, the slit the
specious present of the observer. The screen in w^hich the slit occurs
is the threshold between the supraliminal and the subliminal. Those
wires which are rigid throughout their whole length are those events
over which we are not able to exercise an influence by the inter-
position of our freewill ;
they are completely determined. The
flexible wires are those which we can affect by freewdll ;
they are
not completely flexible and elastic and can only be moved to a
certain extent, thus symbolising the limitations of our power over
them.
To make the picture complete, a further complication must be
introduced. The eye which looks through the slit is, of course, the
eye of the supraliminal, but somehow or other the subliminal mind
is on the other side of the screen all the time and is in conscious
contact with the wires. If my earlier suggestion be accepted, this
conscious contact is effected, not by means of the ordinary senses,
but by an undifferentiated faculty of knowing.
^ This is not strictly correct, as some slight amount of movement is possible
astern of the slit. See Dr Broad's Mind and its Place in Nature, p. 2.56. How-
ever, this point does not concern us for our present purpose.
90 H. F. Saltmarsh [part
But leaving (his asifle I'or the moment, let us try to imagine what
happens when the position of one of the wires is altered by the
exercise of a freewill act operating through the slit.
The arrangement of that part of the wires which is seen through
the slit is disturbed ; astern of the slit they are all frozen into
rigidity, so no effect is produced ; but ahead the whole length of the
wire touched is moved, so that the disturbance stretches indefinitely
in that direction.
Thus an action in the present immediately modifies the entire
future. If we suppose that there are forces of attraction and repul-
sion between the wires, the slight movement of one of them occa-
sioned by the freewill act operating on the small section covered by
the slit may bring about an upsetting of the equilibrium at any part
lying ahead, and thus cause profound and far-reaching changes.
Suppose that I exercise my freewill and move my chair. In its
original position it was in certain spatial and gravitational relations
with the rest of the universe. By moving it I have changed these
relations. The relations are reciprocal. My chair stands in a certain
spatial relation with, let us say, a particular electron on Sirius ; the
electron has a reciprocal relation with my chair. To describe that
electron completely, all its relations must be included ;
they are
part of the conditions which determine its present and future
existence. I move my chair, thereby altering some of these relations
and with them the conditions which determine the present and
future existence of an electron on Sirius. The entire universe is
changed by my freewill act ; its future is modified ; it can never
be the same again.
We may say then that the future is completely determined by
the present, but is not inexorably fixed, for the element of plasticity
allows that which determines the future, i.e., the present, to be
altered.
This plasticity pervades all duration ahead of, and including, the
specious present.
I cannot see that the ontological difficulties raised by regarding
the future as determined yet plastic are any greater than those
which arise from the ordinary view which we take of the present
;
that is to say, as existent yet subject to modification by freewill.
That there are difficulties I do not deny, but then ontology is always
difficult.
We must look, then, on the future as existing but as being subject
to change, so that at the present moment the future, say this time
next week, is so and so, call it A. B.C., but in half an hour's time it
may be different, say D.E.F., having been changed by some freewill
act which I have performed in the meantime.
If I were now to experience a visual precognition of an event a
134] Report on Cases of Ajrparenf Precognition 91
week ahead 1 slioukl get a picture of A.B.Cl., but in hall' an hour
should the precognition occur, it would be a pictui'e of D.E.F.
I have one case which illustrates this rather well. It is the warning
case cited from P. xi. 497. The visual precognition included the
detail of the coachman falling from a box and crushing in his hat on
the pavement. All the events occurred as foreseen up to a certain
point when, owing to the interposition of Lady Z in calling to the
policeman, the course is altered. So far as one can see, had not Lady
Z. interposed, things would have happened exactly as in the dream.
Although I quote this case as an illustration, I am by no means
sure that it is a true example. In the first place it is somewhat
doubtful whether Lady Z's action in calling to the policeman was
really a freewill action. I am inclined to regard it as impulsive and
determined. Moreover, it might be suggested that the detail of
crushing in the hat was an embellishment to the story given by the
precognition, an added detail, that is to say, derived from the dream
factory itself and not from outside.
As we can never determine with any degree of certainty whether
any action is the outcome of freewill, any cases cited will be open to
doubt. The theory, however, does not rest on particular cases, but
on general considerations.
We may say, therefore, that the future exists now in the sense
that it is determined by the present. Yet it is not immutably
fixed, but subject to modifications which are themselves determined
by actions taking place in the current present.
My theory is that the deepest stratum of the subliminal mind is
in permanent conscious contact with this ever-changing future and
that precognitions occur when, for some reason which we do not under-
stand, the knowledge acquired by the subliminal of events lying
ahead of the supraliminal specious present is somehow transmitted
through the threshold ; such knowledge, can, of course, be only of
the future as it then is, or, in other words, as it then is determined
to be by the present. It will have been observed that I have been
using terms which imply the reality of time, whereas I have admitted
my adherence to the opposite view. But when doing so I particu-
larly limited my remarks to completely determined sequences, while
now we are discussing non-determined events. Although I agree with
MacTaggart that time is unreal as regards determined sequences,
I hold that it is real, or rather I ought to say that change is real,
for time is only the common element abstracted from change, in
cases of non-determined or freewill events. A non-determined event
is the coming into existence of something entirely neiv. In so far as
man possesses freedom of will he is subject to true time. Hence I
claim that I was justified in the above use of terms implying its
reality.

It i.s obvious, of course, that the theory which I have suggested
will account only for precognitions of determined events. I see no
reason, and have no evidence for believing, that precognitions of
non-determined events ever occur. In fact. I regard them as
impossible.
That this view implies a very large restriction of the scope of \
freewill, I am ready to admit, but I think that it can be shown on
other grounds that such restriction is necessary. A discussion of the
matter would be out of place here, so I will content myself with
stating that, in my opinion, freewill should be regarded as limited to
a very occasional non-determined change and not as an often
exercised faculty.
I regard it as possible that, although a man may theoretically
possess some degree of freedom, he may not, in the whole course of
his life, ever actually exercise it.^
I am perfectly aware that this hypothesis which I have outlined
may seem fantastic and far-fetched.
It may seem plainly repugnant to common sense to suggest that
a future event may exist in any sense and yet be subject to change,
but I cannot see that this difficulty is any greater as regards the
future than as regards the present. The present xmdoubtedly exists,
and yet, if freewill be accepted, it can be changed.
My theory does not deny the reality of time, or rather I should
say of change, for even if the whole past, present and future is
already existent, changes occur in some parts thereof, but it is only
as a result of non-determined events, such as freewill acts, that
these changes occur ; for determined events the reality of time is
denied.
The position as regards time on this view may be briefly stated as
follows. Determined sequences of events do not exhibit real change ;
they are inexorably fixed. Therefore true time does not apply to
them. They are subject, however, to temporal location ; that is to
say, they stand in relations of the temporal order before and after.
Temporal location must be accepted as a fundamental feature of
existence quite distinct from true time.
' The two varieties of the determinist theory would be represented as follows
on our wke model. On the fatalist theory all the wires are rigid. Though the
observer may possess freewill he cannot move them, for, whatever course he
may elect to pursue, the future is unalterable. I doubt if this theory is really
tenable. On the ordinary determinist theory, he cannot exercise freewill.
He is only an observer, all his actions are represented by wires, there is nothing
outside the bundle of wires which is capable of affecting them ;
therefore,
whether they be rigid or not, their relative positions never change. All
sequences are causal. On the freewill theory some of his actions are uncaused
and are thus, as it were, outside the bundle of wires. Some of the wires, being
flexible, can be moved by this influence from (lutsido.
134] Report on Cases of A'ppareiit Precognition 1)3
Man, as possessing freedom of will, can initiate real change, i.e.,
can bring into existence an entirely new event. He is therefore, in
so far as he does this, subject to true time. He is also, both as regards
his freewill acts and his determined actions, subject to temporal
location, or rather the events in which he is concerned are so subject.
A temporal location series will appear as a true time series when
viewed by an observer who is subject to true time. Hence the
difficulty experienced in conceiving temporal location apart from
time.
But as I remarked above, I do not for a moment suggest that this
is a true account of the way in which events actually happen ; at
the best it is only a more or less convenient way of looking at the
facts. However, there is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that
there is a fact to be explained, viz., that on a few rare occasions the
human mind does make conscious contact with future events. If a
better explanation than the one I have suggested can be put for-
ward, I will gladly jettison my own hypothesis.
Whatever hypothesis we adopt, however, I think that this fact
compels us to the conclusion that the time conditions governing the
• subliminal mind are in some way different from those to which we
are accustomed in our ordinary life.
There is one final remark which I feel bound to make in concluding
this already too lengthy report. If either the view of the curve of
consciousness as approaching the line of duration asymptotically,
or that where it is shown as running parallel, be accepted, the sub-
liminal mind must be regarded as being in contact with the future
over an indefinite period. It would then seem that our ideas on the
question of survival must be affected thereby.
In a sense, we are now, at this present moment, living in the inde-
finite future ; hence the question, " Do I survive bodily death ?"
takes on an entirely different complexion.
If we could find a well authenticated case of a precognition of
which the fulfilling event happened after the death of the percipient,
then I think we should have evidence relevant to the question of
survival. I cannot say that I have found any such case among those
which I have collected, but it is quite likely that such may occur.
Although it is not definitely stated in his account, I think that the
case of M. Berteaux quoted by Prof. Richet in L'Avenir et la Pre-
mofiition is probably an instance. It would be interesting to learn,
if possible, whether the medium who made the prediction predeceased
or survived M. Berteaux. I do not say that precognition proves
survival, for it may be that physical death involves the withdi-awing
of consciousness from a future ahead of the date of death, but I do
think that it is a factor which has to be reckoned with in any dis-
cussion of the subject.

APPENDIX B
ON THE MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS OF THE FOREGOING
CLASSIFICATIONS
It has been suggested to me by Mr Whately Carington that some
information might be derived from mathematical analysis of the
classifications given in the text.
It is obvious that in this matter we are unable to make any direct
comparison between the numbers of successes and failures, as we
have no means of making even the roughest estimate of the latter.
Frequently a precognition is discovered only when it has succeeded,
that is to say it is recognised as such only after it has been fulfilled.
There are, of course, quite a large number of cases where the dream,
impression or whatever it may be is definitely recognised as pur-
porting to be precognitive before fulfilment, and there must be a
large number of failures of this type, but it is quite impossible to
estimate the proportion of success to failure or the proportion of
precognitions recognised as such before fulfilment to those unrecog-
nised.
But this inability does not preclude entirely the application of
mathematical treatment. If we take a number of successful cases
and classify them under various categories it is sometimes possible
to estimate the chance distribution under the different headings,
then, if it is found that the actual distribution shows a divergence
sulficiently large to be considered significant we are entitled to infer
that some factor other than chance has been involved.
For example take the number of cases in which the event foreseen
was death and compare it with that of the other cases. We have
Deaths 100, Other cases 190. If we divide them into Hallucinatory
cases and other types we find that the proportions are different, for
we have
Death. Non-Death. Total.
Hallucinatory 35 28 63
Other types . . . 65 162 227
Total ----- 100 190 290
100 H. F. Salitnarsh [part
By inspection there is a marked discrepancy. Hallucinatory cases
show 35 deaths to 28 others = 55-55% death, while other types show
only 65 to 162 = 28-63%-
To test whether this is significant we apply the usual Contingency
formula
2 _ {ad - hcf {a + h-\-c + d)
^ ~(a + b){G + d){a + c){b + d) ' 'i
where a, b, c, d, are the four observed numbers.
In this case the value of ;)(2 = 15-82 and reference to the
appropriate tables ^ shows that the probability of this distribu-
tion being due to chance is very much less than -01 (1 in
100) so that the observed discrepancy may be taken as definitely
significant.-
It follows therefore, either that the distribution of precognition of
death in the types of case other than hallucinatory is that due to
chance, in which case there must be some other factor operating in
hallucinations to produce a significant increase, or the distribution
in hallucinations is due to chance, when we must admit that
some other factor has operated in the other types to bring about
a significant decrease, or else of course the distribution in no
case is due to chance. Whichever view we take we cannot avoid
the conclusion that chance alone is not responsible for all the
phenomena.
It may be that the suggestion which I made when discussing the
figures simply in the light of inspection, viz., that the higher ratio
of death cases in hallucinations is due to the greater emotional tone
attached to such events is sufficient to account for this discrepancy.
And if this be so, an important conclusion follows. If the cause of
the predominance of death cases in hallucinations arises from a
peculiar characteristic of the event foreseen, it seems to follow that
that event, while still in what we call the future, exercises an in-
fluence and produces an effect in the present. This, if admitted,
goes a long way towards confirming the reality of precognition and,
I submit, lends colour to the hypothesis which I have put forward
to account for the phenomena. For the effect which is produced is
an effect on the mind of a percipient exactly similar in character to
that which would be produced if the event were perceived in the
normal way, i.e. as a present event. This is, however, somewhat of
a digression. To return to the question of mathematical treatment
of the data. In selecting the particular categories to be analysed
'Fisher's Stntistical Methods for Beserirch Workers, Table III.
^ I am indebted to Mr Wliately Carington for help in computing these
significances.
134] Appendix B 101
tliert' are certiuii points which must be cousidered and certain cor-,
rectioiis which must be made.
The first subdivision of the cases is into " good", " ordinary",
and " non-precognitive", and these are classified under the difi^erent
headings such as dreams, impressions, etc.
Now as regards this classification the following considerations must
be borne in mind.
(1) The classification simply represents my individual opinion and
other judges might arrive at different results.
(2) The basis of the classification is twofold, (o) amount of detail,
(6) quality of evidence.
As regards (a) this might in some cases be susceptible of mathe-
matical treatment, but (b) stands on quite a different footing. A
perfectly good case may be spoiled, either because the investigator
neglected to obtain confirmatory evidence, or because the witnesses
refused on quite irrelevant grounds to give that evidence . Or again
the circumstances might have been such that no confirmation could
have been possible, yet the precognition might have been genuine
for all that.
The fact is that this classification of cases refers, not to the occur-
rence of precognition or the characteristics of the phenomenon, but
solely to our grounds for believing that it occurs.
It seems possible at first sight that a useful comparison might be
made between the ratios of good cases to ordinary of two different
types, e.g. between dreams and impressions, as, although the figures
are simply the expression of my opinion, I am not likely to have
erred in favour of one type against the other. Any error may be
assumed to be spread uniformly over the whole and would not,
therefore, vitiate the result. Still, owing to the classification being
based partly on quality of evidence, I cannot see that it can yield
any information about the nature or cause of precognition.
As regards the classification into the various types of event fore-
seen this objection would not apply ; there is little room for error
and practically none for individual bias, the only possible loophole
for differences of opinion would be those which I have mentioned
when discussing the figures of these classes ;
they are, however, quite
unimportant as regards number.
As following on the line of thought suggested by the example
worked out above, I think that a fruitful comparison might be made
between precognitions of events having high emotional tone, i.e.
deaths, accidents and non-trivial incidents, and those not having
this, viz., trivial incidents and winning numbers. I leave out the
categories " course of illness " and " arrival ", as being most likely
due to other causes such as telepathy, auto-suggestion, etc. I
also make a deduction from " accidents to material things '

Inspection clearly shows that the two types, Impression and Hallu-
cination have a much higher ratio of emotional events than the other
types collectively. Suppose that we take them together (throwing
the two small types, Borderland and Crystal in with Dreams and
Mediumistic as being naturally allied thereto), then we have

Testing for significance we have
, (62 X 69 - 96 X 14)^ x 241
158x83x 165x76
= 12.61 P=<.01
which is significant.
I would suggest as an interpretation of this significance that in
dreams and mediumistic cases we have a percipient already in a
state of dissociation, so that messages from the subliminal meet with
comparatively low resistance in getting through ; hence events lightly
charged with emotion may be the subject of precognition, whereas in
the case of hallucination and impression the requisite state of dis-
sociation does not exist ready to hand as it were but has to be created,
so that events which are highly charged with emotion stand a better
chance of getting their messages past the threshold.
There are two points which must be considered in this connection.
First, it might be objected that events of high emotional tone,
being so much more striking than those lowly charged with emotion,
134] Appendix B 103
are more likely to be noticed and apparent instances of precognition
recorded. This must be admitted, but as the error ansmg from this
would presumably be evenly spread over the various types, that is
to say would not apply with greater force, say, to dreams than to
hallucinations, it will average out and not materially aftect the
result. Secondly, it might be said that the cases as to which we
have data do not represent a fair sample of the whole number oi
precognitions actually occurring. I have given reasons for holding
that in the mediumistic type the number in my collection is probably
a small fraction of the whole ; I think that the same thing applies
to impressions and, to a smaller extent, to dreams. But hallucina-
tion is itself so striking a phenomenon that the omissions here may
reasonably be supposed to be considerably less than with the other
types. 1111, -1
Further, the cases not recorded would most probably be mamiy
precognitions of trivial events as being less striking and thus more
easily overlooked or forgotten ; the additions would therefore be
chiefly to the figures for " other events ".
We therefore have an error of understatement m two types on the
dream side and one type on the hallucination side, viz. impression.
Assuming that the error is of about the same magnitude m all cases,
the effect would be to increase the figures for non-emotional events,
and this would make the significance of the discrepancy more marked.
I think that the above is sufhcient to indicate the possible scope of
mathematical treatment and I will content myself for the present
with the two examples worked out. I would suggest that if anyone
was sufiiciently interested in the matter there is a possibility of useful
work in further analysis of the data by this method.
PROXY SITTINGS WITH MRS LEONARD
I
By Mrs Lydia W. Allison
FOREWORD
Readers of the Rev. C. Drayton Thomas's paper in a recent Part
of our Proceedings (xli. 139-185) will be aware of the nature and
purpose of " proxy sittings." They have the advantage that the
sitter, being ignorant of the circumstances to which the communi-
cations ostensibly refer, cannot give anything away consciously or
unconsciously ; nor can direct telepathy from the sitter be con-
sidered an explanation of any supernormal knowledge these com-
munications may show. When therefore we come to weigh the claims
of various possible hypotheses, we have one less to put into the scales
.
_
Mrs Alhson, the proxy sitter in this case, has herself described the
circumstances in which she came to hold the sittings and no further
statement is necessary on that point. There is, however, one matter
to which it may be well to call her readers' attention at the outset.
By far the strongest evidence linking the trance-statements with
the absent sitter, Mr John F. Thomas, and the purporting communi-
cator, his wife, were obtained at the fourth and last sittings. The
statements made in the three earher sittings, though for the most
part apphcable to Mr and Mrs Thomas, were with a few exceptions
of such a character as to be near the borderline of what may be
accounted for by chance coincidence ;
upon which side of this
border they lie is a matter for individual judgment. But the rele-
vance and accuracy of the statements made at the fourth sitting are
beyond what chance will easily account for, and since in this sitting
we are ostensibly concerned with the same persons as in the first
and third, we are justified in regarding these three sittings as forming
a single whole. The case of the second sitting, to which objects
provided by Mr Thomas were taken for " psychometry," is in my
opinion more doubtful, because Feda distinctly stated (p. 114)
that the persons here referred to were not the same as in the first
and third sittings. This is quite possibly a mistake on Feda's part,
but it has to be recognised that the second sitting is not entitled to
the evidential advantage accruing to the first and third from their
being definitely linked with the fourth. The incidents which seem
to afford the strongest grounds for supposing that the second sitting
falls into line with the others are the references to the mausoleum
and the plant without flowers (pp. 115-6).

[part 134] Proxif Sittings ivith Mrs Leonard 105
INTRODUCTION
In the autumn of 1927, Mr John F. Thomas, of Detroit, Michigan,
called on me one evening, introduced by Mrs Thomas Guinan, at
that time secretary to Dr Walter Franklin Prince, of the Boston
Society for Psychic Research. Mrs Guinan had previously written
that Mr Thomas and his son had had some interesting sittings with
mediums in England and America with his deceased wife as the
purporting communicator. I did not attach any special significance
to his visit because persons connected with psychical research have
frequently called on me when passing through New York, at the
suggestion of some mutual friend or acquaintance.
In the course of a casual conversation about the Boston Society,
(of which we both are active members), and related topics, Mr
Thomas told me that Dr J. B. Rhine of the psychology department
at Duke University was editing the records of Mr Thomas's experi-
ments. He did not mention any details concerning the sittings and
said nothing that gave me the slightest hint of his personal affairs.
I did not see Mr Thomas again until two years later, in November
1929, after the sittings on which this report is based had been held.
When I recalled how at our first meeting he had avoided personal
subjects and references to his sittings, he replied that he habitually
refrained from allusions that might be informative.
Shortly after Mr Thomas's first visit I saw Dr and Mrs Rhine,
who stopped in New York en route to Duke. Dr Rhine told me that
he was working on a very interesting set of sittings collected by
Mr Thomas, but mentioned no details. These facts were the only
ones I could recall concerning Mr Thomas, when a letter arrived from
him on 10 May 1929, one week before my departure for England,
from which I quote :
" Mrs Guinan writes me that you are going to
London this summer and I have been wondering whether you would
be interested in trying out an experiment with me there. I still
have a London secretary (Mrs Hankey) who holds absent sittings
with various mediums from time to time. It seems to me it would
be quite good evidence if you would use this secretary for a few
sittings with such mediums as Mrs Elliot and Mrs Garrett. If you
were unknown to the secretary and any of my people participated
in the sitting the material would at least serve to stretch the tele-
pathic hypothesis in order to cover the circumstances."
In response to my request that he describe more fully what he had
in mind, Mr Thomas repUed that he would like me to take some
articles to various mediums abroad for psychometry. I answered
that I preferred Mrs Leonard to any other medium, enclosing my
London address, and as my sailing date was only three days distant
106 Mrs Lydia W. Allison [part
1 also wired kim to forward the articles directly to the ship. They
came with a note from Mr Thomas saying he would write me further
to London. Shortly after my arrival there I received the following
message :
" Thank you for your letter and the telegram. I hope
the articles reached" you. How would it be to try a sitting with
Mrs Garrett and Mrs Leonard before you get in touch with Mrs
Hankey ? It is possible that a skeptic might raise the point that
the mediums associate Mrs Hankey with me and that material
appropriate to me follows. Of course, I know there is nothing to
the point but the most complete way to answer it is to avoid it.
After a sitting or two before Mrs Hankey is brought in, there would
be distinct advantages to working with her. [As will be seen later
I did not follow these suggestions. There remains the possibility of
normal leakage.] As to Mrs Leonard, she is, of course, without a
peer. I had two personal sittings (anonymous) with her in April
and May 1927, and Mrs Hankey (a professional recorder accus-
tomed to taking sittings either personal or absent) held one for me
using articles on 29 October 1928."
On this latter occasion Mrs Hankey told Mrs Leonard that the
sitting was for the American who sat with her in 1927. This admis-
sion, because of the comparatively small number of American
Leonard sitters and Mrs Hankey's having recorded Mr Thomas's
personal sittings, may have immediately suggested an association to
Mrs Leonard, a surmise which, however, does not affect this report.
Mr Thomas added in his letter that he had not mentioned Mrs
Leonard to me because he knew how she is importuned for appomt-
ments and he did not want to presume on my entrance there. With
a single exception, I have always stenographically recorded my
own Leonard sittings. I therefore decided to follow my usual pro-
cedure in this instance and avoid any suspicion that might arise
from my being accompanied by a recorder. Mr Thomas did not
know the dates of my sittings.
A passage from the record of an absent sitting held for Mr Thomas
with Mrs Soule in Boston on 27 February 1928, Miss Lovewell, a
professional stenographer, recording, and Mrs Thomas purporting
to communicate, appears to have a bearing on this experiment,
although its value is dubious. Mrs Soule, who is also known as
Mrs Chenoweth, is the well-known Boston medium who figures so
largely in the investigations of Dr James H. Hyslop and Dr Prince.
It reads thus :
" I have seen a friend of yours whom I did not know
before I died and I think she will be a help to us. I wonder if you
will not be glad to have me refer to a Mrs A. who has talked with
you. Well, I have seen her husband over here and he feels as I
do that we are very dependent on the dear ones on earth for our
success in getting our messages over." My last sitting with Mrs
1.34] Proxy Sittings with Mrs Leonard 107
Soule was more than five years before this reference was received.
I have no reason to think that she knows my name, as I had always
gone to her under a pseudonym, not beginning with " A."
As stated above, Mr Thomas had called upon me for the first
time in the autumn of 1927. Commenting later on the prediction,
he writes :
" I am sure I had never told anybody about my call
upon Mrs Allison in New York. As a matter of fact, it was not in
my own mind, because I hunted about mentally among the relatives
and mutual friends of Mrs Thomas and myself to fit in this reference
and finally gave it up as a lost cause. It did not occur to me that
it was about Mrs AUison until after I wrote her about joining with
me in the London experiments."
On the other hand, it never occurred to me not to mention Mr
Thomas's visit. I recall two instances when I did so, both times to
friends active in psychic research. The prospect of future work
together never entered my mind. Our meeting might, of course,
have reached the ears of Mrs Soule. Even had she been informed
of our conversation, the point remains, however, that she predicted
my participation fifteen months before it was actually considered.
The following points in her statement are correct: "Mrs A."

and I had talked together and my husband is dead.
Blanket Statement.
For purposes of brevity I have adopted certain abbreviations and
designations for use in this report. Throughout I assume that the
communicators are what they represent themselves to be and omit
the quahfying word " purported." The most frequent communi-
cators in my previously reported sittings, who again assist in these,
are Dr James H. Hyslop, described by Feda as " the 'fessor," " the
test gentleman " or "the older gentleman " and my husband, Dr
Edward Wood AlUson, whom I refer to as E.W.A. and whom Feda
calls " your gentleman." The initials E.L.T. specify Mrs Thomas,
who was the principal communicator in Mr Thomas's Leonard
sittings, as she appears to be in mine. Feda addresses me as " Mrs
Lyddie "
;
my own initials are L.W.A. Mr Thomas's report,
" Case Studies Bearing upon Survival," Boston Society for Psychic
Research, 1929, is indicated by " Case Studies." His series of four
Leonard sittings preceding those of this report were held on 26
April 1927 ; 12 May 1927 ; 29 October 1928 ; and 20 May 1929.
At the first two Mr Thomas was present, with Mrs Hankey recording ;
the others were recorded by Mrs Hankey, who presented articles
which Mr Thomas had sent to her for Mrs Leonard to psychometrise.
These sittings are referred to as Sitting 1, present ;
Sitting 2,
present ;
Sitting 3, absent, and Sitting 4, absent. Since Mr Thomas
108 Mrs Lydia W. Allison [part
was almost a complete stranger to me and 1 knew hardly aiiytliiug
about his family or his affairs, 1 have throughout this rej^ort stated
the rare instances where I personally could definitely aflirm or
deny the truth of Feda's remarks. Otherwise, it may be taken for
granted that I had no conscious knowledge of the degree of appro-
priateness of all Feda's other statements.
Sitting with Mrs Osborne Leonard, Monday 3 June 1929,
Tankerton, Whitstable, Kent.
Sitter : L.W.A.
It was not my intention in this first sitting of my 1929 series to
invite failure by proposing an unusual experiment. Moreover I
wanted the sitting for myself. I had left Mr Thomas's articles
behind and hoped to revive the easy, cordial relations that have for
some years existed between Feda and myself before venturing to
suggest psychometry. Feda opened the sitting with several state-
ments which were appropriate enough to me and a prediction which
thus far has not been fulfilled. She then went on to give me a few
further examples of her apparent faculty for acquiring knowledge
of contemporary events concerning sitters. These are omitted from
this report. All the annotations given below are by Mr Thomas,
except those in square brackets, which are my own.^

from your gentleman because he

been thinking very specially of
new glasses just lately. He says
perhaps you can verify that
after.

I have used glasses for some
years for reading, but I do not
wear them otherwise. [On in-
quiry Mr Thomas wrote me that
he did not wear glasses at Mrs
Leonard's.]
I had been having my eyes re-
tested for new glasses, partly as a
result of a statement that I re-
ceived in an absent sitting with
Mrs Garrett, on 2 February
1929, recorded by Mrs Hankey,
and sent to me in Detroit, as fol-
lows :
" I do not think he wears
glasses in the ordinary way but
she is giving me that there is
something wrong with one eye.
I wonder if he has not got to at-
tend to his eyes ... in some way
to the right eye." My visits to
the oculist on 20 and 21 May
1929 were the first times I had
consulted an oculist for several
years. His diagnosis bore out

still thinking " very specially of
new glasses " because I had the
specifications but as yet had not
ordered the new ones, partly be-
cause I was not sure that they
would be any improvement over
the ones I am still vising. I have
not as yet (9.6.29) bought the
new ones, but expect to do so.
Correct.
[I did not know that Mr
Thomas was especially inter-
ested in Dr Hyslop. Feda casu-
ally alluded to Dr Hyslop in Mr
Thomas's first three Leonard sit-
tings, with appropriate but not
evidential remarks.]
Within three or four weeks I
had been going through the Pro-
ceedings of the American Society
in order to find a quotation from
Dr Hyslop with which to close
my report to the Boston Society,
entitled " Case Studies." I
found one and used Dr Hyslop's
name in this report, which was
mailed out from York, Pa., aboxit
six days preceding this sitting.
[Mr Thomas has resided in vari-
ous parts of the United States.]
At the time of this sitting I
was at my summer cottage at
Orchard Lake, about twenty-five
miles out from Detroit. [I
naturally would have thought of
Mr Thomas in Detroit. Perhaps
it is well to emphasise again how
little I knew about him. That he

He may not l)e just where you
would think he was. He may
not be. So you see what I am
feeling so strongly, when getting
this name is that it means water.
As I got that the test gentle-
man said as a matter of fact, he
is near water now, but it has
nothing to do with me. He
means close to the water now,
perhaps at this moment. Is he
packing up now ? Because I get
a strong feeling of his moving
and packing.
(Fortunately, Feda, I don't
know.)
(Feda, why are they giving me
so much about him ? I am in-
terested, of course, but why ?)
Because you already have a
slight link and joxi are going to
be more linked with him.
(Well, it interests me very
much.)
Do you know, has he been liv-
ing in a place where there are
very tall trees with very large
leaves, like a long straight trunk
and the branches coming out
with very large leaves ?
(I will find out.)
The bottom hasn't branches.
They grow rather like a pine
tree. Like that kind of Gothic ;
no branches coming up from the
bottom.
This sitting was held from six
to seven o'clock in the morning,
Detroit time. I find from my
diary that at six a.m. I was at my
cottage directly on the shore of
Orchard Lake. I left there about
six-thirty for my office. The
reference to " packing " is an
interesting point, because un-
doubtedly just at that time I was
picking up and packing my bag
and brief case to come into De-
troit for the week. Florence, my
daughter-in-law, and I have done
a good deal of joking about ways
to eliminate this picking up and
packing, which comes so often
that it bores us a little.
My home in the city is in a
place of just this description.
The section is called " Russell
Woods " and has an unusual
number of tall elms, which begin
to branch out high up. " Like
that kind of Gothic " is a vivid
reference to the immediate sur-
roundings of my home. Mixed
in with these elms are a number
of sycamores and some maples.
Two of these sycamores are very
close to my own lot and they meet
the point of relatively large
leaves. [I knew nothing of Mr
Thomas's home surroimdings.]

Sitting with Mrs Osborne Leonard, Thursday 6 June 1929.
Sitter, L.W.A.
To the second sitting of this series I took the articles Mr Thomas
had sent me for psychometry. There was, of course, no intimation
that these articles had any relation to the previous sitting. This
was the first time that I had ever asked Feda to psychometrise
anything. Considering the difficulty of obtaining Leonard sittings
there was more reason for Feda to suppose that I had a personal in-
terest in these articles than that they were the property of a stranger.
[Almost the whole of this second sitting is omitted. The state-
ments made, although many of them were correct as applied to
Mr Thomas, were for the most part rather vague, and of such a kind
as to leave too much scope for individual interpretation. Moreover,
as stated in the Foreword, Feda never seems to have grasped the
fact that the persons discussed in this sitting were the same as in
the first and third sittings. Brief extracts, in which statements of
a more distinctive character were made, are printed below. The
whole amount of material given is again taken into account in the

Record of Sitting.
[After references to two per-
sons, one " on earth " and one

I am not sure which it would
be, the one on the earth or the
one passed over, but I get an
ache in the side.
The person connected with
these has had a fall.
(Do you know which one ?)
Yes, the one that passed over.
Annotations.
One of the very few physical
disturbances in my life has been
an ache in the side and back,
especially the back.
The ache was the direct result
of a fall which took place at least
seven years before E.L.T.'s pass-
ing.
Wrong. The fall in question
applied to me. [My question,
" Do you know which one ?
"
seems particularly stupid, since
Feda had introduced the subject
of the fall with " I am not sure
which it would be." Definite
leading questions to clinch evi-
dence are always a gamble. I
find it difiicult, however, to re-
sist the temptation, as on a few
occasions the results have war-
ranted taking the chance.]

Mrs Lyddie, would you know if
they had lived near very orna-
mental grounds ; not like a
pretty garden, not like Gladys'
[Mrs Leonard's name] but more
with gravel paths, grass, laid out
flowers in a sort of stiff way,
what you call ornamental ?
I get a funny shaped feeling
Uke a beehive. Glass in it as if it
was made only of windows, like
a beehive with windows.
I feel they would look at this
place with windows and talk
about it.
You go up and down stone

colour of marble. That is right,
very nice steps, beautifully made
steps. There are lumps of rock.

My fall did not prove to be
dangerous, but it certainly was
upsetting, both literally and in
other ways. The word " up-
setting " might be intended as a
pun.
This description could apply
to any modern cemetery. [It
could also apply to a formal gar-
den. Mr Thomas no doubt read
the entire passage before making
his annotation.] We had not
lived particularly near any ceme-
tery of this description. All the
points apply to the cemetery in
which the mausoleum where
E.L.T. is interred is located. We
had not Uved nearer to this than
seven or eight miles at any time,
but we often drove by it.
Nearly every time E.L.T. and
I came in sight of this building
when driving we did look at this
place and talk about it in a
rather desultory way as a place
for burial. As a matter of fact,
the reason burial was made there
was because of these more or
less light-hearted references we
had made to the building. This
was the first time any member of
the family was placed in the
cemetery. We had and have no
family lot.
To get to the particular crypt,
one climbs quite striking stone
steps made of marble. The
" lumps of rock " are the mar-
ble slabs that seal the fronts of
the crypts. [In Sitting 4, ab-
sent, 20 May 1929, Feda de-
scribed Mr Thomas as looking
up at a big, white, gleaming
stone.

(Is this building near the gar-
den, or does it belong to another
place ?)
No, they belong to the same
place ; it is in the garden. I
can't get more.
Mrs Lyddie, do you know if
the one on the earth has had
aches in the feet and legs lately ?
(Why, Feda ?)
I'm getting an achy and tired
feeling about the feet and legs.
That comes rather strongly.
When one passes over you
know how people gives them
white flowers ?
Well, do you know whether
anything was done that was not
white flowers but more like
leaves ? I have a feeling some-
thing symbolical, not any old
leaves, something made of green
leaves with symbolical meaning,
especially made. Leaves, not
flowers ; it's leaves I'm getting.
[part
Mr Thomas interpreted this
passage as referring to the
mausoleum, but no details were
given.]
Correct.
I have been conscious of an
achy feeling, noticeable only
when going upstairs, therefore
there may be some relationship
between this statement and the
following one.
This may refer to the mauso-
leum. The achy and tired feel-
ing was due to too much golf and
I noticed it only when I had
occasion to go up a flight of
stairs, such as the marble steps
at the mausoleum. One striking
thing about the remembrances
in this mausoleum is the pre-
dominance of wreaths and other
symboUcal pieces made of leaves,
a fact that is due to the impossi-
bility of keeping flowering plants
alive and fresh in a building of
this kind. I had, myself, been
looking for some kind of a plant
of green leaves that would live
and thrive there and I had fin-
ally before this sitting decided
upon a fern, which was not
placed until 31 July. I find in
my diary that I stopped at the
mausoleum on my way out to
Orchard Lake on 2 June, four
days before Mrs Allison's sitting.
134] Proxy Sittings tvith Mrs Leonard 117
I had made only one visit there
since the preceding fall. Jerome
[Mr Thomas's son] tells me that
he and his wife visited the
mausoleum on Decoration Day,
30 May, six days preceding Mrs
Allison's sitting of 6 June, and
at that time placed a plant there
that had no flowers but " all
leaves " and that he remembers
the circumstances because they
wondered whether a plant with
just leaves and no flowers was
suitable.

Sitting with Mrs Osborne. Leonard, Monday 10 June 1921).
Sitter, L.W.A.
I have always found Feda very suggestible. It therefore seems
natural that the trend of this third sitting follows the thread coaxed
along and encouraged by me in the first sitting and further developed
in the second. Although, as will be noted, Feda did not connect
the personalities, living or deceased, that she introduced in the
first and third sittings with those of the articles I presented for
psychometry in the second sitting, yet it is obvious that while she
herself denied the connection, the content of all three sittings is
fairly homogeneous.
Record of Sitting.
Good morning, good morning.
I was just talking to them. They
are both here and send their love.
Your gentleman says, " I have
constituted myself"—I wonder
what that means, say messenger
—such a funny word, " a messen-
ger will do." Because lately a
lot of people have been asking
him to get in touch with people
on the earth through you. Peo-
ple I never saw before in my life.
But he say I told them in your
sittings I have not got time to
help them all. (Feda, I wish he
could help the people he spoke of
in my first sitting.)
He is going to help them. He
was just approaching the woman.
In the first sitting he told you
about a lady who passed over not
long ago, but a lady in the mid-
dles. And he wanted to help her
because she was a very good wo-
man and also because the people
that belong to her do miss her so
much on earth.
This has nothing to do with
the people he was speaking of at
the last sitting. It was the first
sitting.
This lady he is speaking of now
[Apparently I myself confused
the content of the first and sec-
ond sittings and Feda took up
the confusion.]
E.L.T. passed over three years
and two months before this sit-
ting, at the age of forty-eight.
[My guess would have been
anywhere between two and five
years before and that E.L.T.
was probably middle-aged.]
[See introductory note to this
sitting.]

has got a geutl«nmu she is very
fond of and is trying to get back
to. And it is to help the gentle-
man on the earth that I am tak-
ing part in this.
(Will she help me to place the
gentleman ?)
That is what she wants to do.
It is your gentleman speaking
really, but in a way he is speaking
for her. The person on the earth
is not someone who is always
with you. He seems to be away
from you. I do not mean in
England, but that man in Amer-
ica isn't close to you, but in a
different condition and place. I
get the feeling that you know
him more through writing than
through seeing you. And it isn't
only that he is in a different—but
the kind of place and circum-
stances are very different.
Then he gives me a rather cut
off feeling, as if he is seeing him-
self out of things. "It is not
easy to get help, to get com-
munication here." He gives me
that feeling rather strongly. I
do not think he is getting a lot
of help where he is and he is
thinking of you as being able to
help him more than he can get
help where he is.
Now I am seeing a big " B."
I think that has got something to
do with the man.
In a way he is rather impor-
tant. He is not like many people
in the place where he lives ; he
Correct. [See Introduction.]
[Mr. Thomas had made a
special point of holding sittings
in places distant from his home,
Detroit. One partially success-
ful sitting with a mental medium,
of which he made only a few
notes, and four or five with a
physical medium, which were
unsatisfactory, constituted his
total experience with Detroit
mediums. It was true from his
point of view that he was " cut
off
'
' from communication in his
home city.]
" B " suggests Boston. [In
Sitting 2, present, Feda had con-
nected Mr Thomas with Boston.
See note on Mrs Soule above and
annotation of " B.R." below.]
These points apply in quite an
apt way to my work in Detroit.

is rather well kuowi), like peopl*'
respect him and looks up to him.
I do feel he has taken rather a
prominent hold in semi-public
things. He has had a good deal
to do in that kind of way. His
name would be known to people
that isn't friends of his.
(Can my gentleman get more
about his name ?)
He wants to. He said it isn't
a long name. Is there an " E "
in it ?
(What do you think ?)
There is a " B " but an " R "
came up rather big. I know the
" R " is rather important. You
won't forget about the " B." It
is rather important. That may
be something you do not know.
I feel he is getting that from the
lady. It is a special name from
the lady. I do not feel you
would know it, but it is more im-
portant than a name you would
know.
Did you know if he had been
thinking of a newspaper or
magazine ? There is something
rather important just now about
a magazine, or newspaper.
That's right, and he said this
man had an ailment himself ; be-
fore the lady passed over he had
a rather delicate state of health
for a time and it looked then as
if he might pass over. You
know, that wouldn't have been
so surprising if he had and the
lady was very anxious then. vShe
wasn't so anxious about herself ;
she was more anxious about him,
and afterwards it was she that
went and he that stayed. Yes,
she had been very anxious.

finances of the Board of Educa-
tion.
[Obviously, there is neither a
"B" nor an "R" in Mr.
Thomas's name, but he says that
" B.R." is the only living mem-
ber of his father's family besides
himself and that he refers to this
relative more often by his initials
than he does by his name, a fact
that is true of all the family.
E.L.T. knew him well.]
[Too vague for annotation.]
[Mr Thomas thinks this passage
refers to an accidental fall he had
about seven years before the pass-
ing of E.L.T. over which she was
much more worried than he, as he
did not consider the effects of the
fall at all dangerous. This refer-
ence is another instance of Feda's
giving similar material regarding
E.L.T. and Mr Thomas in the
psychometry sitting and this
one, although she herself flatly
stated that the people mentioned
in the two had nothing to do

Do you know if she weut
rather quickly ?
(I don't know.)
I get a feeling she went rather
quickly. I think she got a nature
that was trying to keep up and
like making herself feel all right
when she wasn't all right.
There was something here.
[The medium's hands first touch-
ed the base of her chest and then
moved towards her heart.] Peo-
ple had thought her heart was all
right, but it wasn't. There was
something the matter with her
heart ; it wasn't really strong.
Do you know that her heart
had been made weaker by an-
other condition ? It was a bit
compUcated, her condition. Yes,
it was compHcated.
But I feel she had a bodily
condition inside her that weak-
ened the heart more than she
knew herself.
I think she had once lived in a
rather peculiar place, in a place
almost like a mountain. She had
been very fond of rather a peculiar
place because it was many hun-
dreds of feet above sea level and
there was roads there.
You know what he told you
about his being an important
man ?
(Yes.)
Well, the lady was important,
121
with each other. See note,
page 114.]
Correct.
Characteristic of E.L.T.
E.L.T. had an examination of
her heart, which was pronounced
organically all right, but there
was a good deal of functional
trouble.
There is, of course, no way of
verifying this statement, but I
am strongly of the opinion that
such was the case.
This general description strikes
me as quite apt for the Upper
Peninsula of Michigan, a high
rugged country. We went to
live there expecting to find farms,
but did not, although there were
roads through the wilderness.
We did considerable driving over
these roads, as a matter of pic-
nicking and other recreation.

along comes back to this point,
i.e. " P " for " peninsula."

ing.
(Feda, there must be some-
thing that would identify these
people.)
Do you know what an " E "

seeing an " E " with her ; that
it is rather important to her.
(I'll inquire.)
"P." There is a " P " comes
up. The " P " is not for a per-
son's name because he doesn't
mean a person's name ; it is part
of the name of an address. A
part she was very much con-
nected with here.
They hadn't been stuck in one
place much. They did travel
about.
Do you know she has been try-
ing to communicate in America,
and your gentleman says she
made a contact here apart from
you.
(Does she mean with you,
Feda, or only in England ?)
Your gentleman says she has
had a link in England that is not
Feda, but she has also been
through Feda. Perhaps they
didn't mean me to know.
(I see.)
I get a feeling through Gladys
[Mrs Leonard] that I know her.
Did you know her gentleman
on the earth is interested in the
professor ? [Dr Hyslop.] Your
gentleman said it may be rather
important. He has been inter-

Sitting 1, present. For some
reason I cannot explain, except
the " M " given in my sitting of
3 June (see p. 113), I thought
Mrs Thomas's name was Mar-
garet. )
As far as I remember, this
" P " as " part of name of an
address " applies to only one
place where we have lived,
namely, the Upper Peninsula of
Michigan. We have often spo-
ken of it since as " when we lived
in the Upper Peninsula." We
were there for the first two years
of our married life.
During our married life of
twenty-seven years we lived in
six different towns.

reason.
(What reason ?)
It was a sort of scientific in-
terest that made him think of
the professor.
Do you know James in con-
nection with them, in a personal
way ?
(Why, Feda ?)
It is very much connected with
both in a personal way—a name
they were very much mixed up
with, but not the professor [Dr
James H. Hyslop]. A personal
friend, someone they both knew
very well. And then your gen-
tleman began to laugh and said
he was a person you could not
think of comparing with the
professor ;
you wouldn't dream
of comparing them. I do not
know whether he has been
naughty. The professor might
not take it as a comphment if
they had. Perhaps that wasn't
right. He knows your gentleman
will understand it.

whether he remembers someone
that his lady tried to help very
much, who gave a good deal of

Professor Hyslop wrote for Har-

[I knew of no James.]
The James connected in a per-
sonal way was called Jim. He
was one of the vendors to the
school lunchrooms of which
E.L.T. was supervisor. [Feda
had dwelt on Jim at some length
in Sitting 1, present. See " Case
Studies," pages 92, 93 and 125.
Jim regularly presented Mrs
Thomas and the family with a
jug of home-made wine on holi-
days. In Sitting 1, present,
Feda spoke of " Jim and the
D," which Mr Thomas inter-
preted as " Drinks." This li-
quor association seems to be a
forerunner of the following
drinks incident, in connection
with the husband of another
lunchroom employee.]
E.L.T. tried very much to help
a situation which involved the
cook in one of her school lunch-
rooms and her husband. He
was an inveterate drinker.
It was a particular case for
EJj.T. because the brutality of

much as she wanted to.
Do you know if she got a girl
who was related to her with her

The young girl passed over be-
fore she did.
It is a name rather like yours.
It is not Lyddie—sounds like
yours, awful like yours. Lily ?
Lily ? I feel that is rather im-

And then Anna or Annie.
He is trying to write some-

is very interesting. She finished
with three special words, and the
the husband of this employee
kept her away from her work at
times and it was a particular case
for me because the two were
making payments on a house I
had had built for them.
E.L.T. spent a good deal of
time on this case but finally
helped the woman to get a
divorce.
Correct.
Correct.
[The correct name would have
been Laura. In Sitting 3, ab-
sent, Feda described " a young
lady with her [E.L.T.] who pass-
ed over before she did," with
additional facts which applied to
a cousin of E.L.T. of whom she
was very fond. No name was
given at that time. This cousin's
name was not Lily ; it was
Laura. In Sitting 3, absent,
Feda referred to the name Lily,
as one Mr Thomas would re-
member.]
The name of my older brother
deceased was Charles. While
they clashed considerably, I
think E.L.T. had a certain fond-
ness for him. [In Sitting 4, ab-
sent, Feda asked, " Who is
Charlie ?
" and then went on to
another subject.]
My mother's name was So-
phronia Ann, but she was gener-
ally called Ann.

word heart comes near the bot-
tom, and near it a short word
beginning with " 0," and the
word heart and a message close

this particular message trying to
say how close she was. As if this
particular message was espe-
cially reassuring about proxi-
mity. Will you ask if anything
was said in this writing that said
" sun," " setting sun " ? I
think that is right. He said
some awful word—solar lumin-
aries. These words are not there
but what they mean are there.
That would describe something
she had written in the writing.
She sent a message because of
an important date. She sent a
message this way. She specially
chose to send it on an important
date because the man was think-
ing of her very, very much at
that time and she chose a date to
send it on that she knew was im-
portant and that would make
him see that she remembered it.
pears to have some points in
common with Feda's description
:
" I was walking with you on
the shore and it was almost dark
and yet was quite light enough
for me to see you plainly and as
you turned to look back at the
water, I knew that you were
thinking of the old days, . . . and
then it seemed to me that you
said quite plainly aloud, '
Oh,
well, I know she is right here,'
and it was as if you had respond-
ed to my words, for I had been
saying to you the same old
words we used so often in fun,
'
You can't lose me '. . . . Oh
my, oh my dearest one, I do feel
my heart overflow with love to
you and I am still your own
Ethel."]
This message appears to correspond with Feda's statement in
the following particulars :
(1)
" She finished with three special words " :
" Still your own."
(2)
" The word '
heart ' comes near the bottom."
(3)
" Near it a short word beginning with 0 " ; the word " 0 "
occurs twice in the last sentence, also the words " one " and
" own."
(4) There is no reference in the message to the setting sun, but
it is stated that " it was almost dark, yet quite light enough for me
to see you plainly."
" Maa, Mac." I am getting a
name sounds like Machree.

As if it is rather important to

Professor McDougall had been
appropriately made in Mr Thom-
as's Leonard sittings. Also in
a passage omitted from Sitting 1
(above) a name beginning with
Mac was mentioned.]
[Passages are omitted here and earlier in the sitting relating to
attempts to communicate through the well-known medium, Mrs
Soule.]
This lady has been there quite
lately.
(Could he tell me anything she
said there
She had sent the gentleman
rather a special message, with
regard to flowers. She mentions
flowers. Not flowers she knew
when she was here, but some-
thing had been done recently
near the time of sending the
flowers. Something he had done
at that time. He had wondered
whether she had known about
them, so she wrote that thing
through that medium.
[Mr Thomas had two absent
sittings with Mrs Soule on 27
May and on 10 June, the date of
this sitting, five hours later than
mine, allowing for the difference
in time between London and
Boston. During the course of
the latter sitting this message
was given :
" Now I want to
write something about water
liHes, too, for they were always
a very lovely flower to me. I re-
call some that we always called
pond lilies and I think there was
one place where we were never
able to get them, but occasion-
ally we did." " I am thinking of
some little flowers that came up
in the spring and grew in the
woods. This is a very old mem-
ory but it is connected with a
happy experience which I am
sure you will recall, for as violets
are now intimately connected
with my contacts with you, it is
but a continuation of those early
flowers that we loved." About a
week before this sitting Mr
Thomas had placed some violets
before his wife's portrait. Feda's
words seem to combine an allu-
sion to his action with an allu-
sion to the message that was to
be given at the Soule sitting
about five hours later.]

Sitting with Mrs Osborne Leonard, Thursday 13 June 1929.
Sitter: L.W.A.
On 12 June, the day before this sitting, I had an anonymous
sitting at the British College of Psychic Science for Mr Thomas
with a medium named Miss Thomas, recommended to me by Mrs
McKenzie, the Honorary Secretary of the College. The appointment
was made over the telephone. My only stipulation was that I
desired a sitting with any medium good at psychometry. The results
were negative. I had presented the same articles as at sitting 2
above. After the sitting I saw Mrs McKenzie and we chatted about
various subjects connected with psychical research. Mrs McKenzie,
aware of my interest and connection with the Boston Society, told
me that Mr Thomas's " Case Studies " had arrived a few days ago.
She very kindly offered to lend me the volume. I refused, for
obvious reasons, but I deliberately asked one question, " Do you
know what Mr Thomas's wife's name was ?
" Mrs McKenzie said
she thought it must be Ethel, although she did not think the com-
plete name had been given in the record, only attempts to get it.
My reason for that question was to see if Feda would give me the
correct name after I knew it. I was attempting to get the name
telepathically. It never occurred to me until much later that if
Feda gave me the name under those circumstances she might only
be repeating something she had already given in an earlier Thomas
sitting.

(Well, stick to Johnny. What
about him ?
)
Were you thinking about this
yesterday ? Because they were
thinking of this yesterday, as if
you were doing something, too,
that should have reminded you
of Johnny.
(What else ?)
Did you do something ? Two
things could have reminded you
of Johnny. One, I think, would
be more what you call pronoun-
ced. But I feel it could be made
in two things more.
(I think I understand that,
Feda.)
Is there a letter, an initial " C
connected with Johnny more ?
Not you, but someone connected
with Johnny has a name begin-
ning with ' C " very much in
mind.
(Someone on the earth ?)
Yes, on the earth would be
thinking of Johnny and would be
thinking of the " C " as well.
Messenger ? Messenger ? Some-
thing that has to do with mes-
senger more. And that comes

present, Feda said, " I get the
name John on the earth and then
I get a feeling of getting through
John, getting thTOUgh to John."
The name ""
Boston " followed in
the next sentence, and Mr Thom-
as responded with, " Yes, that's
fine." Feda then got " C—an
initial C," to which Mr Thomas
replied, " That's right." A little
later Feda gave the name ""
Char-
lie." In mv record, as will be
noted a few paragraphs farther
on, the C " follows the " John
"
very shortly.]
[One thing that would have
reminded me of " Johnny " was,
of course, my sitting held for
him. The other might have
been my conversation with Mrs
McKenzie concerning the arrival
in England of Mr Thomas's

Case Studies.""]
[Mr Thomas was in close
touch with the widow of his de-
ceased elder brother Charles.
She naturally would have the
name beginning with " C " very
much in mind. As noted above,
Feda had previously given the

connected with " John

tmgs.]

more into yesterday. It all
comes lip with something you
had to do yesterday. Johnny
—" C " —and the word messen-
ger.
Is there someone here in Eng-
land that would be connected
with Johnny ? Because I get a
feeling someone here or coming
soon or very near, where that is
linked up with Johnny more.
Coming here, I mean London.
I get someone who passed over
a few years ago who links up
with this. Before the lady ])ass-
ed over, before the lady, not just
before, like a week or two, but
perhaps two or three years be-
fore the lady did. "C!" "C."
Why do I get the " C " ? The
" C " is someone on the other
side. I am sure that is important.
Do you know the name
Emma ?
(What about that I)
Connected with them because
there is someone the lady has
met called Emma ; that is im-
portant to her.
Do you know, was that lady
very fond of music ?
(Why ?)
I get a feeling of music with
her. I get a feeling she could do
something in a sort of musical
way herself, but I get strongly
she appreciated music and would
always pay attention.

3Iy brother Charles died in
lltlT, nine years before E.L.T.
One of E.L.T. 's school friends
in her youth who is now deceased
was named Emma.
E.L.T. was fond of music and
had been a church organist. She
also sang. During the last fif-
teen years of her life E.L.T. did
not participate herself, but did
not lose her interest in music.
[In Sitting 1, present, Feda in-
quired, " Was she fond of music
when she was here, because I get
a feeling of music around her. . . .
She likes music. I don't think
she is always playing herself, but
I feel she likes it." At this point

She had lived one time in a
condition where she heard a good
deal of music. I get a close rela-
tion of someone awful clever
with music. Not one who is still
on the earth ; she's speaking
now of one who has passed over.
(Feda, I want you to place
these two people more closely in
Anaerica. So that no one will be
able to say, " How do you know
these two people were meant ? ")
Mrs Lyddie, didn't they be-
long to a group, a little scientific
group of people ? I do not mean
scientific like Sir Oliver, but
people who investigated, but in
quite a right scientific way.
(Where did they live l)
In a place not where you live.
Isn't a letter " 0 " near it ?
(I'm not sure about that.)
Can you look at a map to-day?
Because I get a letter "0." I
do not often get an " 0."
It's a civilised place, not
plains. I feel a town.
Isn't a good deal built of
stone ? I see lots of light stone.
They have just added two im-
portant public buildings.
That place is well known.
It is a busy place. [To com-
municator.] What are they

Mr Thomas had not replied.]
Our next-door neighbour for a
number of years was a profes-
sional musician who certainly did
classify under " someone awful
clever with music." He is de-
ceased.
[Mr Thomas has been for many
years a member of the A.S.P.R.
and while E.L.T. had no special
interest in psychic research, she
was not antagonistic. Neither of
them, however, belonged to what
might be termed a " scientific
group."]

from Detroit.]

dramatic examples of medium-

have seemed so much easier for
Feda to say simply " Detroit

in answer to my question,
" Where did they live '\ " But
the giving of a name or a specific
word for which there is no alter-
native appears to create one of
the greatest difiiculties in med-
iimiship. It seems as if the
communicators convey their
meaning to Feda in the form of
thought which emerges in her
consciousness as hearing, sight or
impression and which accounts
for the roimdabout descriptions.]

some rather big pieces and what's
the circles, wheels, that I see ?
Because I see wheels and circles
and all sorts of round and square
things and hundreds and hun-
dreds of men working. No, the
professor says thousands and
thousands ; and the whole place
is like a beehive of humanity
working in these huge places.
Do not forget this, they have
added to, that is what I meant
by the two places they have add-
ed and enlarged. It is noisy
—
it's hammering on metal—ring-
ing noises. They runs along,
they runs along. Like this.
[Imitating whirring sounds.] The
professor says, " We hope they
do," but he is laughing. He
knows they do. Some are sent
out incomplete and some com-
plete. Because some are assem-
bled in other places. Wait a
minute. [Sotto voce.] What

[Feda's description of Detroit
in answer to my question,
" Where did they live," was im-
pressive in the extreme and
again leaves me in doubt as to
the advisability of asking direct
questions. On 1 August I

enclosing the following questions
on a sheet of notepaper, leaving
space for her answers, which she
promptly returned.
" '
Have you heard of Detroit

Yes.

If so, do you know anything

No—not even
in what part of America it is.

He says I haven't quite ex-
plained something in connection
with this, like what you call in-
dustry. There has been some
extension lately and that is im-
portant, very important, but
what he knows and what other
people don't know he did, the
people who have made the recent
extension is contemplating an-
other. Which you are bound to
hear about in the course of a few
months, even if you do not ask.
[part
so many anonymous sitters there
may have been one from Detroit
—but I do not know of it."
(Signed) Gladys Leonard.
To an American it seems al-
most incredible that Detroit and
the automobile industry should
not be immediately associated.
A dozen well-educated English
people whom I questioned on
this point had all heard of De-
troit but not one of them knew it
was the automobile manufactur-
ing centre of America. However
improbable this may seem, I
should like to suggest trying a
similar experiment. How many
Americans know where the most
popular English and French cars
are manufactured in their respec-
tive countries ? For instance,
where is the famous Citroen
made ?
Mrs Leonard's mention of
" Detroi " strengthens consider-
ably the surmise that her allu-
sions are meant to apply to Mr
Thomas and E.L.T., making a
definite and tangible link with
them. No reference to Detroit
by name or description occurs in
Mr Thomas's Leonard sittings.]
[The recent " extension " asso-
ciated with the automobile in-
dustry Feda had just described
might indicate the complete re-
organisation of the Ford plant
about two years previous to this
sitting for making an entirely
new type of car. As to the sec-
ond " extension " which Feda

Do you remember—[Sotto
voce.] No, she doesn't know.
[Aloud.] Well, that is what he
says, a few years ago, perhaps
ten to fifteen, there was some-
thing these people were very
misjudged over. They are peo-
ple who would never do what
they knew to be wrong ;
they
neither of them would.
I think the very thing that
they were doing that people
should have appreciated them
for—^it was the man specially—
they were misjudged on for the
time being.
Only for the time being. But
it was rather bitter, hurtful at
the time.
Wait a minute. It was a
policy they were upholding, a
principle which they were mis-
judged on. But they were right
and they stuck to it.
Perhaps, Mrs Lyddie, it isn't
right to say that.
(Oh, yes, it's all right. Do go
on.)
Now, these people seem to
Feda as if they were rather well
off.
I get feeling of comfort and
money, but they were connected
with people who weren't well off
;
the man was and more than the
lady. I don't know if it was
polite to say so, but the man had
135
30 Dec. 1929, a little over five
months after this sitting, carried
a top centre, front page, double
column article, announcing the
Ford Company's proposed ex-
penditure during the next year
of more than $30,000,000 for
plant expansion.
This brought at once to my
mind a quite serious difficulty
that I had at one time with one
of the then members of the
Board of Education. I looked it
up in the Proceedings of the
Board and find that it was almost
exactly fifteen years ago.
Correct, and from E.L.T.'s
point of view.
Emphatically so.
Correct.
Correct. [I should have as-
sumed so.]
Correct. This is very striking,
particularly so because it selects
my side of the family rather than
that of E.L.T.

connections in his family that,
was not at all well off. I get a
feeling of hard times. I'm sure
he came of a family that one side
would be rather poor.
Has he got any connection at
all with Irish people ?
(I don't know, Feda.)
Because I get a connection ; I
am going back now to Ireland.
A funny link. You do not often
get mixed like a connection with
Ireland and with Scotland, too.
I think both that is in his family.
Does he cough ? Has he got
catarrh ? (Why ?)
While they were talking he
gave me a feeling like an ordin-
ary chest condition ; it's not
lungs, it's not throat, back of
nose catarrh, a little to one ear.
He has to be a bit careful, there
—there. [Passing fingers over
sinus along nose.] It is, but I
wish he'd be careful near ear.
He feels like an energetic man
;
like a man with some goes in
him.
I think a man that would wear
himself out a bit ; the lady used
to say so.
She used to be far more afraid
that something would happen to
him than to her. She used to
think it.
The professor say we touched
on that in a previous sitting ;
that at one time she had been
afraid when he had been ill and
that he might pass over.
She little thought she would
pass over ; she didn't think she
would. She got a great hope in
her ; she was a hopeful person.
I do not know whether you

I have a tendency in this direc-
tion but it seems to me this is
over-emphasised.
[Mr Thomas is an energetic
man.]
This is correct from E.L.T.'s
point of view.
Correct. •

While this is true in general I
think E.L.T. had a premonition
of death.

kuew this, I thiak I told you the
other day he had an iUness that
made her very anxious. He got
over that and then he wasn't
very well again and she had been
a bit anxious about him a second
time. And then she herself
passed over, not long after.
Though they were well off and
they lived in a nice place, they
lived like a very, very simple life.
They wasn't people that liked a
terrible lot of luxuries, and could
do without it.

themselves instead of asking a
slave to do it.

—Effie. Ettie. Do sound like
Ettie. Haven't got it quite
right. I am not sure I got it
quite right. It is rather impor-
tant, a name rather near to
them. A little name very much
like that. Ethi—Ethi—Ethi—
Ettie—Ettie—sounds like Ettie.
Awful much like that.
Ruben. Wait a minute. Do
you know a name sound like
Ruben connected with them ?
That is what it sounds like.
That seems to be right because
the 'fessor nodded his head.
Keep giving a funny name

(Ask him to spell it, Feda.)
I asked him to spell it but he
doesn't. Sounds like Hirsch

Emphatically so.
[Mr Thomas says that E.L.T.
had a very independent nature.]
[As already stated, Mrs
McKenzie had told me she
thought E.L.T.'s name was
Ethel. See Introduction to this
sitting, page 128. In Mr Thom-
as's Sitting 1, present, Feda,
said, " Do you know a little
name beginning with '
E,' too,
that she is interested in, because
I see '
E.' Maybe Eff—Effel,"
to which Mr Thomas replied,
" Yes." In my third sitting
Feda asked what an " E " had
to do with the lady, to which I
answered, " I'll inquire." See
page 122.]
Ruben is a very suggestive
name from E.L.T. Marks Ru-
ben was a clothing merchant
very well known to us in our
earlier life. He died within the
last year or so.
Ruben, a Jewish name, may
have suggested the second Jew-
ish name, Hersch. [Hersch is

Sadie, also Jewish, was an
office associate of E.L.T.
I know of no Cornell. [Mrs
Cornell WooUey, who has been a
regular Leonard sitter for many
years and whose principal com-
municator is her deceased hus-
band, Cornell, had had a sitting
with Mrs Leonard two days
previously. The giving of this
name might be an association.
I recorded a Leonard sitting for
Mrs WooUey several years ago.]
Up to the time she was seven-
teen or eighteen E.L.T. lived
alongside a railroad with her
family. My home was three
blocks down the street from
E.L.T.'s. [This is, of course,
charted " Wrong " because Feda
inquired, " Have they lived close
to a railroad ?
" It seems that
some allowance should be made
for Feda's confusing the pro-
nouns. Suppose she was shown
a house near a railroad, or re-
ceived that impression telepathi-
cally. It would be quite under-
standable for her to conclude
that it was the home of the two
people concerned. Evidence has
frequently been weakened by
Feda using the wrong pronoun
when the facts otherwise were
correctly stated.]
E.L.T. did live just beside it.

get where you could walk in ten
or fifteen minutes.
(Do you mean their home, or
the town, is near a railroad ?)
No, it's not like the town. As
if this railroad is being thought
a lot of. :
:
Was there like two railroads,
one big railroad, an ordinary
railroad that everybody used,
and then I get the feeling of a
funny little railroad and I feel the
people in this place would be
very interested in this little rail-
road.
The professor said you might
call it a little railroad but it was
remarkably efficient in its own
way.
The lady and gentleman were
in some way interested in this
little railroad. They were very
interested, it interested them
rather in some personal way.
Not as if you were saying, " Oh,
it is a little railroad," but as if
there was some interest that they
took in it.
In that place they were telling
me about, this place that was the
busy place, what he calls the
beehive that is in America, did
they do something in connection
with England ? Because I feel
This railroad has been all our
lives very much in the thoughts
of all of us. E.L.T.'s family has
been connected in various capaci-
ties with this particular railroad
ever since it was fixst built.
This is a striking statement
because there was in our experi-
ence a " funny little railroad
"
about which we have laughed a
great many times and in which
we were very much interested.
It is about one hundred miles
from Detroit, but Jerome and I
had been on an auto trip the
Saturday and Sunday preceding
this reference during which we
were near this railroad and at
which time we talked and laugh-
ed about it a good deal.
One point that always struck
us was that, while it was a sort of
a toy railroad, it did get its two
trains along every day and quite
noticeably on time and managed
to make an annual profit.
The personal way in which we
were interested was that before
we had a car we used this rail-
road to get from Detroit to a
cottage that we owned in south-
ern Michigan and the family used
to make two migrations on it an-
nually for several years.
[The Ford Automobile Com-
pany of Detroit has its English
branch at Manchester, in the
north of England. I only learn-
ed this on subsequent inquiry.]

with the North of England, not
only in London where anybody
might have them, but I'm going

What did she say about his
coats ? The lady used to tease
him about the shape and cut of
his coats. Before she passed
over he had a coat she didn't
quite like, and she talked about
this coat quite a lot.
The reason he is giving this
to-day was because she was with
him only a little while ago and he
was thinking of that very coat
that she made discouraging re-
marks—not, it isn't discourag-
ing, it is disparaging—remarks.
Has he been, I think in the
last two or three months, doing
something in her name ? It
wasn't a gravestone, but it is
something she is very pleased
about which he has done during
the last two or three months.
And though it isn't a gravestone,
like an important thing to her
memory. That is right. It is
something she is pleased about.
And it is something that will
last, that will live in people's
memory. That is correct.
The professor says you might
easily describe it as a memorial
but it is not a memorial in a con-
ventional sense, it's bequeath,
that word fits. Building and be-
queathing.
Correct and especially about a
particular coat. This coat was
one that was made by a Jewish
tailor years ago when I was
principal of a Jewish school.
This tailor made the coat very
long and of rather grotesque cut
and when I protested said that it
was a " coat good enough for a
rabbi," or some similar remark.
This " rabbi coat " became a
stock joke in the family.
Jerome and I had been talking
and laughing about this very
coat not long before this refer-
ence was received.
During the last two or three
months previous to this sitting I
was having a baptismal font
built as a memorial to E.L.T. to
be placed in the church which
had replaced the one where she
had been organist. n
It is not a bequest from E.L.T.
,
but a project initiated and car-
ried out by me in the spring of
1929, and dedicated on 9 June
1929. Jerome and I had made
the trip, passing near the little

with Margaret. Then he sud-
denly said, " She is with Mar-
garet."
Messenger—can't get this mes-
senger. No, it isn't the name
Messenger he's trying for but
sounded like it. A Christian
name, a surname. The professor
said if you said the name Messen-
ger indistinctly you would al-
most mistake it. It is awful
much like Messenger. Every
time he tries for it, it goes into
Messenger. The professor said
that name is important because
it is someone they were both
very interested in.
Did they go mider a big arch-
way where they lived ? They
used to go backward and forward
under a big archway.
(You mean the lady and gen-
tleman ?)
Yes, somewhere they often
went under a big archway.
Were they going to take or
fetch money imder that arch-
way ? This may be important,
the professor says. They would
naturally be thinking of money
because of somewhere they were
raihuad of which 1 .spokc above,
in order to be present at a dedi-
catory service for this baptismal
font on 9 June, the Sunday pre-
vious to this reference.
The name Margaret is con-
nected with one of the towns in
which we lived, Hastings, Michi-
gan. It is the most important
town along the line of the little
railroad discussed above. Mar-
garet was a high school pupil
when I was connected with the
school there, who died later
imder rather distressing circum-
stances.
The name of two elderly gen-
tlemen, who were the leading
citizens in this same town that
was on the little railroad and
with which Margaret was con-
nected, was " Messer." The
Messers, Margaret and we lived
on the same street.
We did go backward and for-
ward under a big archway on an
auto ride that we took very fre-
q^uently, and it was the most
striking feature of this ride.
For several years we took this
ride practically every Monday
night for the purpose of going to
a branch bank where I had a
number of monthly collections
made for me on land contracts.
Mrs Lydia W. Allison [part

going to wliL'U they passed under
it.
Close to archway is something
making a trickling noise. Be-
cause I get the feeling of running
water that isn't quite still but
making a noise.
Do you know, have they ever
been in an accident together ?
(I don't know.)
Not just before she passed
over ; it would be several years
ago. Yes, it is going back a good
while. It had nothing to do with
her passing. It was something
they got out of alive, but I get a
feeling it might have been a
collapse. [Feda described this
supposed accident in some de-
tail.]
Do you know if for a time they
had lived in a place, such a funny
place, looks not like brick house.
Looks like a wooden house.
I cannot place any running
water by this archway. Every
time it rained, however, the sur-
face water ran down so that it
was a couple of feet [inches] deep
on the paving.
[Mr Thomas recalls a personal
accident but none in which he
and E.L.T. figures. Might not
this description typical of any
serious railroad accident be a
logical sequence of association by
Feda with her correct references
to railroads a few minutes earlier
in the sitting ?
Feda often spoils good evi-
dence by her enlargement and in-
terpretation of orignally correct
statements. One thing suggests
another until she has built up a
picture. Perhaps she is only
keeping the pot boiling during
the intervals between the efforts
of the communicator.]
This applies to the house where
E.L.T. lived as a child and young
woman. It was a frame house

The lady has some special
reason for mentioning this place,
I am sure.
The reason she mentions this

be in an important part of their

rather important. It wasn't that

It was that the time of their

It was a clapboard house. [A

Part of this house was on piles
or posts instead of the ordinary
foundation. I remember this
distinctly and so does E.L.T.'s
sister, because we have heard her
tell of having to crawl under the
house to bring out the next
younger brother when he was a
baby and had hidden himself
there. The piles or posts were
used instead of foimdations,
probably because it was felt that
the location of the house on the
right-of-way might be only tem-
porary. Foundations and not
posts or piles were the usual
underpinning for houses all
through that section.
The special reason E.L.T. may
have had for mentioning the
house was that it was located
beside the railway she previously
described.
This is an additional reason
for mentioning the house. It was
an important period in our lives,
because E.L.T. lived there when
we first met.

she is happy because she is with

Oh, has he arranged three por-

think I get this right. He has
arranged three portraits together
lately. I think they are por-
traits of her.
Mrs Lyddie, I don't know if
you know this. It doesn't look
like a hat, but something draped
around her head. I think draped
is wrong. It is almost as if some-
thing were fastened around her
head.
He wishes to say this specially.
Ask him whether he thinks in
one portrait she has a slight look
of the Madonna. He has thought
so and she knew he had.
The 'fessor says her face is not
of the typical Madonna shape
but in one portrait she seems to
have been caught in a way that
gave her the expression that
helps the idea. He says it has
caught it in an extraordinary
way more than any other. She
had no other that caught it that
way.
But he seems to be doing
something lately with three por-
traits. I get the feeling of put-
ting them close together like
grouping them together.

Shortly before this sitting I
had arranged three photographs
of E.L.T. along the bottom of the
mirror on my dresser. There
were originally five.
In one of these pictures E.L.T.
wears a hat around which is
draped what looks like a veil.
In this same picture E.L.T.
has a motherly expression which
her sister and I had spoken of as
being most characteristic.
This is strikingly true of this
picture as compared with any
others.

I know of no photographs of

would apply. A portrait of her

PART 135
WHY I DO NOT BELIEVE IN SURVIVAL
By Professor E. R. Dodds
The composition of this paper was suggested to me by the following
passage in the address delivered to the Society in 193'2 by Dr Brown :
" It seems to me that at the present day the evidence for survival
which must have most weight with us is the evidence from philo-
sophical and religious considerations, from the nature of the human
mind, the nature of human values, and the extent to which survival
itself would make life and the -whole world process more rational.
I do think that considerations such as these are sufficient to produce
in our minds at any rate an active pragmatic conviction of survival.
'
'
A little further on he adds :
It seems to me that the scientific researchers are concerned
rather with getting sufficient evidence to supplemetbt evidence that
they all accept as really the fundamental groundwork in their
religious and philosophical beliefs." ^
On reading these remarks of Dr Brown's, the following reflections
occurred to me. (1) If it is true, as Dr Brown says it is, that all
the scientific researchers who are working on the interpretation
of the supernormal evidence are from the start imbued with an
antecedent conviction that survival is a fact, then it would be not
only interesting but actually prudent to see how this evidence
appears to less biassed observers or, failing that, to observers whose
bias is in the opposite direction. (2) There should be no difficulty
in obtaining such observers : for, so far as I can judge, the view
of the antecedent probability of survival which Dr Brown attributes
to all the scientific researchers " is not that which would be taken
by the majority of working scientists outside this Society ; it is
also in strong conflict with the views of distinguished philosophers
1 Proc, xU. 86.
K 147
148 Professor E. R. Dodcls
of various schools like Dr Broad, Earl Russell, and the late
r. H. Bradley ; and it conflicts no less with the impression
formed by a large number of educated people who are neither
scientists nor professional philosophers. Taking myself as an
average representative of this last class, it occurred to me further
that it would be useful to me, and might possibly be of interest
to others, if I attempted first to present a brief reasoned statement
on the probability of survival as it appears to me, and then to
formulate in the light of this statement an attitude towards the
supernormal evidence with the problems of interpretation which it
presents. This seemed to me preferable to the usual practice of
either considering the supernormal evidence in isolation from the
antecedent evidence, or taking for granted a particular view of the
latter without attempting a reasoned defence of it.
I was, however, well aware that the view which any man takes
of the antecedent probability, or otherwise, of human survival
must itself depend to a great extent upon his general philosophical
and religious outlook, and that in turn upon his individual tempera-
ment and history. Hence any attempt at discussing the antecedent
probability of survival runs the risk of raising issues so vast, so
vague and so insoluble as to swallow up the entire discussion in a
futile exchange of unproved generalisations. If this were to be
avoided, it seemed necessary to confine myself to a statement of
the case as it might appear to a person sharing the same general
presuppositions as myself, and to indicate explicitly what these
presuppositions are. The argument claims validity only in so
far as this framework is accepted. That is why in the title of my
paper I have violated the esteemed precept, beloved of girls'
schools, which forbids to the writer on general topics the introduction
of the pronoun " I ". This paper does not pretend to be a complete
statement of the case against survival ; it is merely a statement
of my own reasons, not for regarding survival as impossible,
but for thinking the hypothesis unproved (and in some at least
of its forms definitely improbable), and in that sense disbelieving
it.
The presuppositions I have referred to are two in number. The
first is that our sole means of reaching a conclusion on this question
consist of observation and experiment together with the exercise
of reason. This excludes the view that we have divine authority
for the belief in survival. A complete statement of the case against
survival would have to take account of this view, and investigate
its claim to historical truth. I do not share the curious opinion
that such investigation is bad form, nor the alternative opinion
that it has been rendered unnecessary by the conclusion of a treaty
of peace between science in the person of Professor Jeans and
135] Why I Do Xot Believe in Survival 149
religion in the person of Bishop Barnes. But it is evident that
to attempt in the present paper any statement of my reasons for
rejecting this view would carry the discussion too far from the
immediate question at issue.
My second presupposition is that the validity of our apparent
experience of mind and matter as two distinct modes of reality is
accepted as a working hypothesis on the empirical level, without
excluding the possibility that either may prove in the last analysis
to be a mere appearance of the other. Both idealism (or " men-
talism ") and materialism seem to me to be possible ways of inter-
preting our experience ; neither seems to be required by the facts,
and a survey of their history suggests that the influence of each has
depended less on its inherent convincingness than on its political or
religious utility, on the variations of social demand, and on the
dialectical dexterity of its exponents. This being so, an argument
which is valid only on the idealist or only on the materialist hypo-
thesis carries, for me, less weight than one which is valid without
this limitation.
Within this very wide framework, then, before approaching the
evidence from psychical research I ask myself what are the ante-
cedent probabilities for or against survival. In its favour I find
two distinct types of argument advanced. The first, which Dr
Broad calls metaphysical, and which Dr Brown intends (I think)
when he speaks of the evidence from the nature of the human
mind ", asserts under varying forms that our mind has a quality
in common with the ultimate stuff of Reality, or with the creator of
Reality, and that the possession of this quality assures its con-
tinuance : in theological language, it asserts man's immortality
as a consequence from his divinity. On this argument, two reflec-
tions occur to me. In the first place, it rests on a proposition about
Reality (or about its creator) which may be true, but which I do
not certainly know to be true. I do not know of what ultimate
stuff the universe is constituted, nor how it came into being ; and
certainly I find nothing in my experience which assures me that
my continued existence is indispensable to it. But secondly, if
this type of argument proves anything at all, it appears to me to
prove too much. As the late Dr McTaggart put it,
" I do not see how existence in future time could be shown to be
necessary in the case of any being whose existence in past time is
admitted not to be necessary. If the universe got on without me
a hundred years ago, what reason could be given for denying that
it might get on without me a hundred years hence ? Or if it is
consistent with my eternal nature that its temporal manifestation
should begin at some point in time, could we find any reason for
supposing that the cessation of that manffestation at some point
150 Professor E. R. Dodds [part
in time would be inconsistent with that nature ? I do not see of
what kind such a reason could be, nor do I know of any attempt that
has been made to establish one." ^
In other words, if we accept the metaphysical argument as a
valid proof of survival, we must accept it also as a valid proof of
pre-existence. This is, for me, unfortunate. For the doctrine of
pre-existence is open to several objections which I do not know
how to meet. Until these have been resolved for me, I feel con-
strained to reject the theory of pre-existence, and with it the
metaphysical argument for survival.
I think, however, that even if I could accept the metaphysical
argument, with all its consequences, this would have but little
logical bearing on the interpretation of mediumistic utterances.
For the entity whose immortality and pre-existence the meta-
physical argument has been held to certify is not, so far as we can
judge, at all like the entities which converse with us at seances.
It is a timeless, noiimenal self, exempt from passion and withdrawn
from change, and held to be imperishable either because of that
very detachment or because of its capacity for pure impersonal
thought. Now, whatever the " controls " and " communicators
"
of Mrs Piper or Mrs Leonard may be, it seems certain that they are
not noiimenal selves (if they were, they would give small satisfaction
to the average sitter). Far from being exempt from passion, they
are frequently emotional to the point of sentimentality ; and pure
impersonal thought is precisely what their communications con-
spicuously lack. Hence I do not think that the metaphysical
argument, even if it were valid, could help us, at any rate directly,
in the interpretation of these phenomena.
I turn to a brief consideration of the ethical arguments for survival
(or, more exactly, for immortality), described by Dr Brown as " the
evidence from the nature of human values, and the extent to which
survival would make life and the whole world-process more rational."
It is argued (i) that an apprehension of timeless values in some way
1 Some Dogmas of Religion, chap. iv.
- 1 have been asked what these are. In answer, I should mention the
following difficulties among others, (a) If the doctrine means anything,
it means that in addition to the recognised factors of heredity and environ-
ment a third, presumably far stronger factor, is operative in the formation of
human character : is it not strange that no certain trace of the activity of
this factor has been detected by psychologists ? (6) It means, again, that the
new-born infant possesses, or rather is, a mature and experienced mind : is
it not strange that all the manifestations of that mind are precisely what we
should expect them to be if it were neither mature nor experienced, but were
in fact, what it appears to be, an infant muid in an infant body '?
(c) The
doctrine involves the assumption of an act of incarnation whose mechanism
is exceedingly difficult to picture and which lacks even the remotest analogue
in our biological knowledge.
136] Why I Do Not Believe in Survival 151
constitutes a claim to a permanent existence in time ;
(ii) that the
non-survivalist view is in some way incompatible with the good
life for man, and should therefore be rejected ;
(iii) that the non-
survivalist view is incompatible with the goodness and rationality
of the universe, and should therefore be rejected. I confess that
these arguments appear to me completely nugatory. The first, so
far as it is not a restatement of the old metaphysical argument,
seems to rest on a mere confusion. If values are really " timeless ",
their timeless nature may be as fully actualised in an experience
lasting thirty seconds as in one which lasts thirty thousand years.
And observation does not suggest that there is in nature any
correlation whatever between valuableness and temporal per-
manence. As to the second argument, I discover little either in
my personal experience or in my reading of history which tends to
show that a belief in survival is morally necessary or even, for the
average person, morally useful ; but were the reverse the case, I
should still find it impossible to leap from an admission of the moral
utility of the belief to Dr Brown's " active pragmatic conviction
"
of its objective truth. Finally, to consider the third argument, I
find death no more irrational than copulation, birth, and a thousand
other natural events ; while to the suggestion that our extinction
amounts to a charge of immorality or insanity against the universe,
I can only reply that the universe, so far as my limited knowledge
of it extends, is like other fathers of families " capable de tout ".
Those who desire a more critical examination of this group of
arguments may be referred to the eleventh chapter of The Mind and
its Place in Nature, where Dr Broad breaks these butterflies upon
the wheel of a remorseless and elegant logic. With his conclusion,
that no valid philosophical grounds whatever have been produced
for believing in human immortality (or in human survival either),
I find myself regretfully obliged to agree.
My next question is. Are there any positive antecedent grounds
for rejecting the belief in survival ? If this question means, " Can
survival be shown on antecedent grounds to be impossible ? ", the
answer is, I think, that it cannot, save on the materialist pre-
suppositions which, as I said at the outset, I do not feel constrained
to accept although they may be correct. But secondly, Are there
any valid grounds for considering survival improbable ? There are
two considerations, each of which seems to me to raise a presump-
tion, faiiiy strong though falling short of proof, not indeed against
all forms of the survivahst hypothesis, but against the particular
form of it which is required to account for the supernormal pheno-
mena.
The first of these considerations is historical, and is in part an
152 Professor E. R. Dodcls [part
argument from silence. Now arguments from silence are notoriously
dangerous ; and in this case Dr Broad holds that the absence of
evidence for survival does not constitute evidence against it, since for
all we know the conditions of existence after death may be such as to
exclude the possibility of affirmative evidence being obtained.^ This
is a perfectly satisfactory answer from the point of view of the ortho-
dox Christian, who believes the dead to be segregated in Heaven, Hell
or Purgatory ; it is also satisfactory from the point of view of the
man who says '
I believe that the dead survive, but I know nothing
of their powers or their mode of existence or their location in space."
It is less satisfactory from the point of view of the spiritualist. For
if the spiritualist interpretation of the supernormal phenomena is
correct, we know a good deal about the dead, and what we know is
inconsistent with Dr Broad's defence. All spiritualists believe that
the dead have both the will and the means to communicate with the
living, either by controlling the hand or vocal organs of a medium
or by influencing her mind telepathically. Most of them believe
also that the dead can make their existence known by speaking to
us directly, without the intervention of a human organism ;
by
appearing in visible form ;
by the production of supernormal lights ;
by the supernormal movement of objects ; and in various other
ways. Now if the dead are really endowed with powers so varied
and so remarkable ; and if it is true, as they themselves tell us, that
they are much occupied with the problem of comforting and assisting
their surviving relatives ; on these assumptions is it not matter for
surprise that they refrained for so long from exercising their powers
and making their existence known ? During two and a half
millenia of which we have fairly full written records—say from
650 B.C. to A.D. 1850—they failed so far as I know to produce
satisfactory experimental evidence of their identity."^ Why ?
During certain portions of this period they might have endangered
their surviving friends by attempting to communicate with them ;
but there were long centuries during which action on their part
would have been perfectly safe. Nor was there any lack of the
necessary machinery or the necessary interest on the side of the
living : the evidence collected in Oesterreich's book on Possession
shows that the mediumistic trance is a fairly constant phenomenon
in all ages and among all peoples ; and curiosity about the state of
1 Op. cit., p. 524.
- 1 do not, of course, deny either that necromancy was occasionally prac-
tised, especially in later antiquity and the Middle Ages, or that the belief in
the power of the dead to return in certain circumstances was general in the
latter period. But the " spirits " appear to have made little or no attempt to
establish their identity ; and the ordinary mediaeval belief was founded
much less on contemporary experiment than on the biblical story of the witch
of Endor.
135] Why I Do Not Believe in Survival 153
the dead has left its mark on the Uterature alike of Greece and
Rome, of the Middle Ages, and of the Renaissance. But there is
something more singular still. The two groups of pre-nineteenth-
century mediums about whom we have most information, the
KHToxoi of the late Graeco-Roman period ^ and the witches of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, while performing a number of
the feats performed by modern mediums, perversely attributed
them in the one case to the agency of non-human gods or demons,
in the other to the agency of the devil. Once again, why ? A
satisfactory answer may one day be forthcoming ;
but until it is, I
cannot but feel some doubt about the correctness of the spirituaHst
interpretation of the contemporary phenomena.
I come now to my second consideration, which is a very familiar
one. It is drawn from certain apparent features of the relationship
between the living mind and the living organism. Now it must be
admitted that any attempt to interpret psycho-physical relations
is in the present state of our knowledge fraught with danger and
uncertainty, especially for the non-physiologist Uke myself. Keeping
this warning before me, let me nevertheless consider the phenomena
of old age. Anyone who has lived much in the society of the aged,
and has observed them closely, will I think agree, whatever inter-
pretation he may put upon the facts, that not only the human
organism but the human mind, or that portion of it which expresses
itself in thought, feeling and action, does appear to grow old. I
am thinking here not merely of the grosser effects of time, those
which a physician would classify as symptoms of senile decay ; but
also of the subtler psychological changes which come with advancing
years, the gradually increasing imperviousness to new ideas, the
gradually diminishing response to emotional stimuli, above all, the
growing sense of finality, of fulfilment, of a destiny accomplished
and accepted—in a word, the progressive encroachment upon the
will to live of a new will to cease from living. Analogous changes
appear, so far as we can judge, to attend the onset of old age in the
higher animals, notably the dog and the horse.
Can these appearances—pathetic in some of their aspects, in
others singularly beautiful—be interpreted in a manner consistent
with survival ? Many have thought so ; but I cannot myself feel
that the interpretations they have suggested are free from grave
difficulty. It may be held that the old age of the mind is a tempo-
rary disease caused by the action of toxins produced by the ageing
organism, and that on separation from the organism the mind will
recover. But I find it hard to believe that growing old is really a
reversible process—that mental changes so far-reaching as those
associated with old age can be undone even when the supposed
^ See Journal, xxvii. 216 ff.
154 Professor E. R. Dodds [part
originating cause is removed by death. Moreover, does not this
line of argument assume a degree of dependence of mental states
upon organic secretions which is sufficient in itself to create a strong
presumption against the mind surviving after the dissolution of the
organism ? Another expedient is to assume that, besides the
phenomenal self which experiences old age and its natural con-
summation in death, there is a remoter, ageless self which does not
die because it does not grow old. But this hypothesis, apart from
the total absence of any evidence in its favour, seems open to the
same objection as the noiimenal self of the metaphysical argument
—
for an ageless being can hardly be credited with an origin in time.
In any case, like the noiimenal self, it fails to throw much light on
the supernormal phenomena : an element of the personality so
remote from all ordinary observation and so strangely exempt from
experience seems an unlikely carrier for the collection of small
personal reminiscences which are the stock-in-trade of the average
" communicator ".
The general situation as regards the connection between mind
and body is I think reasonably and moderately stated by Dr Broad,
who says :
^
" The view that the mind is existentially dependent on the
organism and on nothing else is compatible with all the normal
facts, and is positively suggested by them, though they do not
necessitate it. And it is the simplest possible view to take. The
theory that the mind merely uses the body as an instrument is
difficult to reconcile with the normal facts."
Dr Broad's own theory is that the mind is a compound product
of the organism j9^?/-s what he calls a " psychic factor and that this
psychic factor survives bodily death although the mind or personality
does not. He claims that this hypothesis (a) covers all the observed
facts, both normal and supernormal, and (6) is the minimum hypo-
thesis which does so. Whether, if the first claim be granted, he is
right in the second is a question to be discussed at a later stage.
But I may venture to suggest here that the hypothesis in question
does not seem to cover the supernormal facts very satisfactorily.
Let us assume that when the late John Jones professes to com-
municate, and the communication is veridical, what has really
happened is that a detached psychic factor, once an element in the
mind of John Jones, has allied itself with the organism of the
medium to form a new temporary mind, which is not the mind of
John Jones but has one factor in common with that mind. Dr
Broad supposes this alliance to result in the reinstatement of certain
memories which were once present to the mind of John Jones, and
the reproduction of certain modes of behaviour which were once
1 Op. cit., 549.
135] Why I Do Not Believe in Survival 155
characteristic of that mind. So far, so good. But what if " John
Jones " goes on to describe correctly some event which has occurred
since John Jones's death, and is unknown to the medium and
perhaps also to the sitter ? There is nothing exceptional about
such an occurrence at a good sitting. Mr Saltmarsh, in his valuable
analysis of 142 sittings with Mrs Warren Elliott, found that in this
series the total number of veridical statements about events subse-
quent to the death of the supposed communicator was actually
larger that the total number of such statements about events prior
to his death ; and that the percentage of veridicality was also higher
in the statements about events subsequent to death. ^ Now this is
hardly what I should expect if the source of the communications
were the surviving personality of John Jones ; but still less is it
what I should expect if the source were a psychic factor of the sort
assumed by Dr Broad. " A psychic factor by itself ", says Dr
Broad, " is no more a mind than John Jones's corpse is a mind."
What it is, or does, when it is " by itself " (i.e. unconnected with
an organism), Dr Broad cannot tell us ; but at any rate it is not a
mind. From the day that John Jones's organism perished, his
widowed psychic factor ceased to function as a mind, or element in
a mind, until the day that it contracted an irregular union with the
medium's organism. How, then, can it be a possible source of
information about events which occurred in the intervening period ?
But if it is not a possible source, to what source shall we attribute
such information ? To the telepathic or clairvoyant powers of the
medium, or to the agency of non-human spirits ? I see no other
alternative, since the agency of the dead is ex hyjMhesi excluded.
Yet either step is surely fatal to the whole theory. For once we have
granted that by the exercise of telepathic or clairvoyant powers, or
by the agency of non-human spirits, the medium can supernormally
apprehend an event which happened in 1916, the year after John
Jones died, it appears wanton to invent a wholly different explana-
tion for her supernormal apprehension of similar events in 1914
when he was still alive. The psychic factor has become, it seems
to me, an entirely otiose hypothesis.'^
But if I reject Dr Broad's interpretation of the evidence furnished
by psychical research, what interpretation am I to adopt ? In the
first place, where a normal explanation appears possible I shall
certainly accept it. I am, however, satisfied that neither chance nor
cheating, nor any combination of the two, will suffice to account
for the whole of the mental phenomena of mediumship. (About the
physical phenomena I am less certain ; but these do not in any case
come much in question here, since the great majority of them do

156 Professor E. R. Dodds [part
not afford even prima facie evidence of survival.^) As regards the
mental phenomena, my choice is practically confined to three views :
(ffl) That which attributes them to the exercise by the living of
supernormal faculties, viz. telepathy, or a combination of telepathy
and clairvoyance.
(6) That which attributes them to the agency of non-human
spirits.
(c) That which attributes them to the agency of the surviving
dead. I will call these respectively the telepathic, the daemonist
and the spiritualist hypothesis.
Now if my initial presuppositions are accepted, and my subse-
quent reasoning is valid, these three hypotheses vary widely in
their antecedent probability. The telepathic hypothesis invokes
no agency for whose existence there is not strong independent evi-
dence : the independent evidence for regarding telepathy as a vera
causa seems to me almost conclusive,^ and that for clairvoyance
very substantial. The daemonist hypothesis has the status of a
bare unmotived possibility : I know of no valid evidence against
it, and I cannot agree with Mr Drayton Thomas in calling it far-
fetched and fanciful " ; but the only evidence in its favour is
drawn from pre-scientific sources to which I can attach little
weight. The spiritualist hypothesis seems to me, for the reasons
I have given, to start under the heaviest handicap of the three ;
not only is there no valid argument in its favour, but there is a
definite antecedent presumption against it, although this does not
amount to disproof. This being so, an elementary canon of scientific
method requires me to give the preference to the telepathic theory,
provided that it adequately covers the phenomena to he explained.
But does it cover them adequately ? This is the crucial point of
the whole enquiry, and to this I must now address myself.

which have been advanced against the telepathic hypothesis. Most
of them were mentioned 12 years ago by Dr W. F. Prince in a paper
which he read at the First International Congress of Psychical
Research ;

proves (and the proof is valuable) that the conditions of these expermients
are unsuitable for provoking the phenomenon.

and from a recent paper of Mr Drayton Thomas's. I proceed to
consider them seriatirn.
(1) It is objected that the telepathic hypothesis does not account
for the fact that communications invariably claim to come from
the surviving dead.^
About this there are two things to be said. In the first place,
the claim in question is by no means invariably made. Prior to
the rise of the spiritualist movement in the nineteenth century the
spirits of the dead were far from enjoying, if we can credit our
documents, any monopoly of the control of mediums : the professed
source of the communication was at least as often a non-human
daemon or familiar, while in many cases no agency is alleged other
than that of the " seeress " or " wise woman " herself. And even
to-day the asserted monopoly is not without exceptions. Dr
Osty, for example, has obtained numerous veridical communications
both about the living and about the dead, comparable in range and
accuracy with those of the best spirit mediums, from a subject, Mme
Morel, who has no " controls " and no " communicators " and does
not regard the dead as the source of her supernormal knowledge.^
It can hardly be doubted that were this lady imbued with the
current spiritualist convictions her communications would emerge
from the subconscious as orthodox " spirit messages ".
For secondly, if we know anything about the working of the
subconscious mind, we know (a) that it is addicted to dramatisation,
and (6) that its dramas are usually if not always wish-fulfilments :
both points are abundantly demonstrated by the study of dreams.
Remembering further that the great majority of recent mediumships
have been developed in a spiritualist environment, and that the great
majority of sitters come to mediums not out of scientific curiosity
but out of hunger for communion with the dead, I can find nothing
in the facts here which I should not expect to find on the telepathic
hypothesis.
(2) Dr Prince argued in 1921 that the wholesale ascription to
mediums of telepathic powers was unjustified, since the experimental
evidence suggested that only a very small minority of human beings
possessed these powers in any recognisable degree, and there was no
independent evidence that any medium possessed them.
The force of this argument has since been greatly weakened by
the publication of a number of incidents which seem to have their
origin in telepathy from sitter to medium. Perhaps the most
striking of these is the John Ferguson case, published by Mr Soal
1 Proc, xli. 139 ff.

tale," Rev. Meiapsychique, 1932-3, pp. 80-3.
158 Professor E. R. Dodds [part
in Proc, xxxv. The communicator, " John Ferguson ", was
eventually shown to be a fictitious personality ; but before this
happened Mr Soal (the sitter) had privately invented a number of
hypotheses about " John Ferguson's " life and circumstances,
which hypotheses were at subsequent sittings communicated to him
as facts. This fictitious communicator also made a number of
veridical references, the source of which could hardly have been
any other than Mr Soal's mind. Mr Soal has himself mentioned
the possibility ^ that the medium (Mrs Blanche Cooper) may have
been assisted in her " mind-reading " by unconscious whispering
on the sitter's part. The suggestion lacks proof and requires a
deal of stretching to make it cover the facts ^
;
yet if the case stood
alone it might be not unreasonable to discount it on the ground of
this suspicion. In fact, however, it by no means stands alone. Dr
Osty has described numerous instances where different mediums
have reproduced beliefs or hypotheses which were present in the
minds of various sitters, but were subsequently proved to be
erroneous. 3 It is not easy to suppose that all these sitters (including
Osty himself) gave themselves away by unconscious whispering or
other means. Moreover, Osty finds that " quand on experimente,
en seances successives et periodiques, avec un menie sujet sur un
meme etre eloigne, il est aise de se rendre compte que ce qu'on
apprend sur cet etre entre deux seances permet au sujet, dans la
seance suivante, de preciser, de rectifier, de developper ses revela-
tions anterieures." * This agrees in principle with Mr Soal's
experience ; and it points clearly to telepathy from the sitter.
Nor are incidents of Uke import lacking in the records of Piper
and Leonard sittings. Thus when Newbold was sitting for auto-
matic writing with Mrs Piper, an irrelevant (and rare) name, which
he had erroneously associated with the supposed communicator, was
1 Proc, xl. 177.
2 It rests primarily on Mr Soal's statement that he possesses " an exceptional
tendency to articulate words inaudibly " (Proc, xxxv. 475). Did the tendency
manifest itself at the Cooper sittings ? Mr Soal thinks not, but it is hard to
be certain (his bona fdes is naturally not in Ciuestion). Would his inaudible
articulation convey anything to an experienced lip-reader ? It seems quite
possible. But what I cannot readily see is how on this hypothesis I am to
explain such things as the very indirect yet quite convincing reference to
the name " Paglesham " (p. 540). I can imagine Mr Soal unconsciously
answermg his own question by articulating " Paglesham " : but would he
articulate the ingeniously fantastic description " where cowslips grow in
cockle beds ", and the personal allusions which foUow V I permit myself
to doubt it.

reproduced as a spirit utterance in Mrs Piper's script.^ Again, when
the experimenter (Hodgson) thinks about Sir Walter Scott, an
obviously fictitious " Sir Walter Scott " communicates next day
at the Piper sitting ; when he thinks about D. D. Home, a similarly
spurious " Home " presents himself next day.^ In the same way
Mrs Beadon (one of Mrs Leonard's sitters) meets in the street a lady
whom she has not seen for twenty-four years, and is thus reminded
of the lady's brother who died twenty-five years earlier ; at Mrs
Beadon's next Leonard sitting, a few days later, " Feda " refers
to this man by name and gives identifying details. Mrs Beadon
states that she has observed parallel occurrences at many sittings.^
Again, Mrs Salter heard one evening in conversation an anecdote
about a man who wore several pairs of trousers simultaneously ;
next day at a Leonard sitting the control purporting to be Professor
Verrall remarked to Mrs Salter " It isn't given to many men to wear
two pairs of trousers. Well. I did once, I think you'll remember."
Mrs Salter did not remember.^ Here it looks as if the control
mistook an anecdote telepathically derived from the sitter's mind for
an incident in Professor Verrall's life. Again, in the White case
Miss Nea Walker's erroneous belief as to the circumstances of the
death of the presumed communicator is reflected by " Feda." ^
The evidence of such incidents is cumulative. If they are con-
sidered individually, possible alternative explanations can usually be
devised. But collectively they seem to me to enforce the admission
of telepathy from the sitter as a vera causa. The next step is to try
to learn something of the conditions and limitations under which
it operates ; and for this purpose deliberate experiments in tele-
pathically influencing the course of a sitting, on the lines of the
Ferguson case, should in my view be undertaken.^

Proc, xxxii. 133 ff., where ""
Feda " seems to have built up a fantasy about
an imaginary " spirit " out of scraps of information telepathically derived
from the sitter. It is worth noting also that Mi's Leonard claims to have
experienced in her normal personality at least one veridical hallucination of a
type usually assumed to be of telepathic origin {My Life in Two Worlds,
p. 23).
® The examples I have collected suggest on the whole that the ideas most
likely to be transmitted are those which occupy not the foreground but the
background of the sitter's consciousness. Cf. the difficulty which even the
best communicators find in replying to a direct question ; and the remark
of Flournoy that les idees des assistants qui ont le plus de chance de se
transmettre au medium sont ceUes c^ui se trouvent en quelque sorte a I'etat
naissant ou evanescent, je veux dire sur la limite entre la conscience et I'incon-
science, en train de passer de Tune a I'autre " {Esprits et Mediums, p. 481).
This need not preclude deliberate experiment, but it should be borne in mind
by experimenters.
160 Professor E. R. Dodds [part
(3) It is objected that if the telepathic hypothesis is to cover the
facts we must credit mediums with the power of drawing on the
contents of the minds of living persons quite unknown to them,
who are not present at a sitting, and to whom their attention has not
been in any normal way directed. Such an assumption, it is urged,
goes far beyond any telepathic feats of which we have independent
evidence ; and if the phenomenon occurs only in spiritistic conditions
we must assume that spiritistic conditions are requisite for its
production.^
This objection is more formidable than the last ; and it has been
brought into special prominence by the striking successes achieved
by Mrs Leonard in " proxy " sittings. But, like the last, it loses a
good deal of its force when we consider some of the incidents pub-
lished by Dr Osty. These seem to show (a) that correct information
outside the normal knowledge of all present at the sitting, concerning
private details of the life of absent persons, may be given by sensi-
tives who do not profess to be assisted by spirits "
; (6) that
incorrect information may be given which corresponds to the
belief of a third party who is unknown to the sensitive. Of the
first type a number of instances are given in La Connaissance Supra-
normale : e.g. Mme Peyroutet, on being asked by Osty to describe
the past life of the person of whom he was thinking, furnished
numerous details of a highly individual character which were quite
unknown to Osty but were subsequently attested as correct by
intimate friends of the person in question.-' The circumstances
here are analogous to those of a " proxy " sitting with Mrs Leonard,
save that the being whose past is disinterred is a living being and
not a dead one. The second type is exemplified in the case of the
pretended Grand-Duchess Anastasia. Here the sensitive (Mme
Morel), on being presented by Osty with a letter written by the real
Grand-Duchess and a flower which had been handled by the pre-
tender, had a series of visions which corresponded neither with the
objective facts as subsequently verified nor with the impressions
in Osty's mind, but with the fictitious story told by the pretender
—
a story which we are assured was at the time unknown to Mme Morel
and only partially known to Osty.^
Osty is not the only investigator who has obtained results of this
sort without the professed aid of spirits. Andrew Lang pointed out
many years ago, a propos of the Piper controversy,* that Miss Angus's
crystal-gazing experiments afford strong prima facie evidence of an
independent character that " third-party " telepathy (to use a con-
1 Cf. Mr Thomas in Proc, xli. 161 ; and Prince, op. cit., p. 112 S.

135] Why I Do Not Believe in Survival 161
venient phrase) really is a vera causa. On one occasion, for example,
" Miss Angus described doings from three weeks to a fortnight old,
of people in India, people whom she has never seen or heard of, but
who were known to her '
sitter '
,
" in circumstances which appear to
preclude explanation by collusion or coincidence or telepathy from
the sitter. Yet neither in this nor in any other of Miss Angus's ex-
periments is there any suggestion of the direct or indirect agency of
the dead. A spiritualist interpretation might, I suppose, be forced
upon these cases and upon Osty's : it is certainly not the natural one.
Still less is a spiritualist interpretation applicable to the messages
which Mr Soal received through Mrs Cooper from a supposedly
deceased Gordon Davis—who subsequently proved to be alive and
well at Southend.^ Apart from the apparent element of prevision
which it contains, this puzzling case seems to be susceptible of two,
and only two, rational explanations. One is that the source of the
messages was the subconscious mind of Mr Soal : this requires us to
assume a considerable, but perhaps not impossible, amount of
cryptomnesia on Mr Soal's part. The other is that the source was
the subconscious mind of Mr Davis—a person who was quite un-
known to the medium,^ who was a good many miles distant at the
time of the sittings, and to whom the medium's attention had not
been in any normal way directed.
On the whole, I feel obliged to conclude that third-party telepathy,
if it cannot be regarded as an established phenomenon, has consider-
ably more than the status of a bare hypothesis. The independent
evidence in its support is not very abundant, but it is not negligible.
Its paucity need surprise no one who remembers («) that in everyday
life instances of long-distance telepathy from complete strangers,
if they occur, are very unlikely to be recognised ;
{b) that in this
country at any rate a " sitting " practically always means an attempt
to obtain communications not from the absent living but from
the dead. The remedy for the latter circumstance lies in our own
hands.
(4) It is objected that the vivid presentation in trance of a
personality normally unknown to the medium is not adequately
explained save on the spiritualist hypothesis. Mr Salter has
recently mentioned this along with the last objection, as two of the
three chief stumbling blocks in the way of the telepathic theory ;
^
and Mr Thomas lays great stress on it.
To this contention there are two possible rejoinders. In the first
j)lace, sceptics may doubt, and have in fact doubted, whether in
1 Proc, XXXV., 560 ff.

^ Journ., xxvii. 331.
162 Professor E. R. Dodds [part
the circumstances of a sitting such " vivid presentation of a per-
sonality " ever has substantial value as evidence of identity. They
point out that when the tones of the trance speech are recognised by
the sitter as those of a familiar voice, or when certain mannerisms
or fa^ons de fader are felt by him to be characteristic of a certain
person, it is very rarely possible to check the objectivity of the
recognition, as can usually be done when a name, a date or an event
is in question. The door is commonly left wide open to the insidious
temptations of the will-to-believe—temptations whose potency in
this context can be fully realised only by those who have either been
sitters themselves or made an impartial study of the annotated
records of sittings.
But secondly, whether evidence of this type has much or little
value, there is some reason to think that certain mediums can on
occasion " reproduce " the personalities of the unknown living with,
as much success as those of the unknown dead. At any rate, Dr
Osty tells us that one of his sensitives. Mile de Berly, is capable of
" reproducing approximately the timbre and rhythm " of the voice
of persons living or dead whom she has never heard speak, of " saying:
what they might say or might have said ", and of " exhibiting their
customary attitudes." ^ One would have liked more detailed
evidence about these remarkable powers of Mile de Berly—but in.
default thereof it is worth while to look again at the Davis case. The
communicator in that case spoke, in Mr Soal's opinion, with a voice
and accent closely resembling Davis's—so closely that early in the
first sitting Mr Soal was impelled to cry out " By Jove, and it's like-
Gordon Davis !
" Moreover, the communicator reproduced so
successfully a number of Davis's mannerisms that Gordon Davis-
himself later agreed, when shown the record of the sittings, that it-
was very like Gordon Davis. Nevertheless it wasn't Gordon Davis.
It wasn't Gordon Davis unless you are prepared to assume that-
he could simultaneously interview a client at Southend and con-
verse with Soal in London through the lips of Mrs Cooper. Person-
ally I find this assumption more staggering than any which is
involved in the telepathic hypothesis ; and I must therefore con-
clude that the latter hypothesis is not invalidated by the recog-
nised reproduction of such personal characteristics as voice, accent
and idiom.
^

^ It is immaterial to the argument whether we suppose the impersonation
to have been based on material telepatliically derived, either from Mr Soal
or from Mr Davis himself, or on the other hand simply assume that both Mr'
Soal and Mr Davis were victims of the will-to-believe. The point is that a
vivid impression of Davis's personal presence was produced on a highly
intelligent observer in circumstances which make it incredible that he was
in any sense really present.
135] Why I Do Not Believe in Survival 163
(5) A further objection to the telepathic hypothesis is
that it appears to involve an otherwise unexampled selective
action of the medium's mind, in supernormally deriving
from other' human minds precisely those remembered facts
which are required for the building up of a particular trance
personaUty. This was the spear-head of Hyslop's argument for
the spiritualist interpretation of the Piper phenomena, and has
often been urged since.
But I do not think that the available evidence in the least requires
me to picture the subconscious mind of the medium hunting through
the subconscious mind of the assumed agent, as through a lumber-
room, until it finds precisely the bit of information which it needs
in order to give verisimilitude to its impersonation of some deceased
friend of the agent. I am equally free to imagine that when
rapport is established between the medium's subconscious mind and
that of the assumed agent, the nature of the material transmitted is
determined by the relative emotive force of the agent's various
complexes, or by the fact that the material belongs to an associative
complex some elements of which are already in the medium's mind,
or by any other cause that you like to suggest. Selection does
undoubtedly operate at some stage before the material is presented
in trance ; but I see nothing to prevent its operating after the
material has become part of the furniture of the medium's sub-
conscious mind. I am free to imagine, in the first place, that the
particular complex of feelings and images which underlies a par-
ticular trance personality attracts to itself only such elements of
the newly acquired material as have some associative relevance to
its existing content ; and secondly, that the " control " who sits in
the gateway of trance—Feda or Topsy, Phinuit or Rector—operates
on occasion, like the Freudian " censor ", to prevent the emergence
of irrelevant or disturbing matter which might interrupt the illusion
and break the continuity of the medium's dream.^ These are no
more than guesses, although they derive a certain amount of support
from the known mechanism of the normal dream. I claim no more
for them than that they cover the observed facts as well as any other
hypothesis, and better in one important respect than the hypothesis
of possession. The degree of relevance and continuity to be
observed in most trance communications is, to say the least, ex-
tremely limited. In Mr Saltmarsh's words, " one of the most
striking features of communications received through trance
1 Cf. a remark of the acting control" in one of Mr Thomas's Leonard
sittings : "If she [a certain communicator] tells me anything that disagrees
with what she told me previously, I shall have to inform her that, in this
confusing condition of the sitting, she is not recollecting clearly Proc,
xli. 175.
L
164 Professor E. R. Dodds [part
mediums is their disj ointedness " This is what I should expect from
the sort of psychological machinery I have suggested ; it is not what
I should expect if the communicators are what they say they are.
(6) A further objection to the telepathic hypothesis is that it fails
to account for certain cases of " object-reading " (popularly called
" psychometry "). The cases in question are those where a relic
is submitted to an entranced medium, its ownership and history
being unknown both to her and to the sitter, and she nevertheless
furnishes correct details about its present or former owner. These
puzzling occurrences have been most fully studied by Osty in La
Connaissance Supranormale, by Prince and Pagenstecher in Proc.
Amer. S.P.R., xv. and xvi., and by Mr Saltmarsh in his report on
Mrs Warren Elliott.
They are, it seems to me, puzzling occurrences on any hypothesis.
The notion that the relic in some unimaginable way carries a per-
manent record of its own history, which the medium is able to read,
is definitely put out of court by the fact that much of the information
supernormally obtained in such cases refers to scenes in which the
relic played no part whatever." It apparently functions not as a
record but as a signpost pointing to some mind, living or dead,
whence the information is then supernormally derived. How is this
function exercised ? On the telepathic theory, the source of the
information will be a living mind, usually and perhaps always that
of the contributor of the relic ; but I do not know how the presence
of a watch or a purse creates a rapport between the medium's mind
and that of the contributor. Equally, on the spiritualist view, I do
not know how the presence of a material object causes the particular
spirit which once owned that object to present itself to two strangers
at a particular time and place. Are we to imagine the spirit, in the
Warren Elliott experiments, following its relic from the house of
the contributor to 31 Tavistock Square, and vigilantly haunting the
S.P.R. rooms from the day of the relic's arrival until the day when
chance determined that this particular relic should be removed, still
in its wrappings, and without the contributor's knowledge, from the
locked cupboard and conveyed to the sitting ? or if not this, what
are we to imagine, short of crediting the dead with omniscience ? I
can only echo Driesch's remark that object-reading is " the most
mysterious and inexplicable of all supernormal phenomena ".
It seems worth while, however, to mention an analogous incident
which occurred in the Sinclair telepathy experiments, and to which
Mrs Sidgwick called attention in her review of Mental Radio. The

135] Why I Do Not Believe in Survival 165
drawings used in these experiments were prepared in advance in
batches, either by Mr Sinclair or by his secretary, and were then
wrapped in green paper and placed in sealed envelopes. Mrs
Sinclair later picked up the envelopes in succession and tried to
reproduce the contents without opening them. Now on one occasion
the secretary included in his batch two drawings which were not by
him but by a person unknown to Mrs Sinclair. On picking up the
envelope containing the first of these draw'ings, Mrs Sinclair gave a
description which did not apply to the drawing in question, but did
very accurately apply to the stranger's other drawing, which came
seven places further on in the series. It looks on the face of it as if
the handling of the stranger's first envelope had somehow served to
establish telepathic rapport between Mrs Sinclair's mind and the
stranger's. If so, we have here another case of the directive in-
fluence of the relic ;
only here the
'
' relic
'
' has no association with
the dead, and the dead do not profess to co-operate in the achieve-
ment of the result. No solid argument can be based on a single
instance ; but I suggest that it is desirable to carry out further
experiments on these lines both with Mrs Sinclair and with Mrs
Elliott.
Another parallel in a non-spiritist context is furnished by certain
of the feats attributed to the Polish amateur clairvoyant M. Osso-
wiecki, who makes no claim to the assistance of " spirits ".^ Hand-
hng, for example, a sealed letter whose authorship and contents
were not normally known either to him or to Geley (the only other
person present), he stated correctly, among other things, the age of
the writer and also that of the writer's wife (who was mentioned in
the letter).^ These facts were not given or implied in the letter ;
they were not (apparently) known to Geley, who in any case could
not be normally aware of their relevance to the letter ; and the
experiment had no connection with any deceased person. We
seem reduced here to a choice between two explanations—an un-
likely coincidence, or " third-party telepathy mediated by a
material object.
(7) It is further objected that the amount and quality of the
veridical information given varies not with changes of sitter but with
changes of communicator—which is the contrary of what we
should expect on the telepathic hypothesis.
The evidence on this point is not so abundant as one could wish,
since most sitters always evoke the same communicator, and most

l2
166 Professor E. R. Doclds [part
communicators always manifest themselves in response to the appeal
of the same sitter or group of closely associated sitters. Mr Thomas
claims that in a set of " proxy " sittings recently studied by him
this difficulty is removed, since the actual sitter (Mr Thomas) was
the same throughout the series, while there were 24 different
communicators : he thinks that " it may therefore be assumed
with some confidence " that variations in the veridicality of the
communications depend on variations in the ability of the com-
municators. I cannot myself feel any such confidence. In 20 of
these 24- cases the experiment was originated by the relatives of the
alleged communicator, who were in many instances not personally
known to Mr Thomas ; and I gather that the bulk of the facts
correctly given at these sittings were unknown to Mr Thomas at the
time when they were given. It follows that on the telepathic
hypothesis the ultimate source of the information about these facts
is to be sought in the minds of the surviving relatives ; and each
communicator had apparently a distinct set of relatives. We are
thus landed back in our old difficulty : when the communicator
changes, the possible telepathic sources of relevant information
change too, and variations in the veridicality of the communications
can be equally well ascribed to the variation of either factor.
It is, however, a fact, as Hodgson pointed out, that some com-
municators, such as Mrs Piper's " George Pelham ", have been
successful with a number of different sitters, while others have
consistently failed with a variety of sitters. This is perhaps most
easily explained on the spiritualist hypothesis. But other explana-
tions are not impossible : e.cj. that the dream figure called " George
Pelham " emerged from a deeper stratum of Mrs Piper's subconscious
mind than the dream figure called " Stainton Moses ", and was
therefore more accessible to impressions telepathically received.
And there is on the other side a fact which tells, so far as it goes, in
favour of the telepathic hypothesis, namely that while some sitters
consistently fail, others receive veridical information from a number
of different communicators : Mr Soal and Mr Thomas himself are
cases in point. My general conclusion is that little weight can be
attached to objection 7.
(8) In the paper already mentioned Mr Thomas advances a series
of objections which may be summarised in the statement that in
these 24 cases there was no observable correlation between the
success or failure of a sitting and the presence or absence of condi-
tions which Mr Thomas considers favourable to telepathy.
I am afraid that the answer to this is that we know next to nothing
about the conditions favourable to telepathy. I do not know which
of Mr Thomas's cases were " likely cases " for telepathy, though Mr
Thomas apparently does. There are only two things that I can say
135] Why I Do Not Believe in Survival 167
(and those not very confidently), (a) Other things being equal,
telepathy is probably more likely to occur when agent and percipient
are in the same room than when they are miles apart.^ This test
cannot be applied to Mr Thomas's cases, since in none of them was
the presumed agent present at the sitting. But in the Warren
Elliott series studied by Mr Saltmarsh, which included 53 ordinary
sittings and 89 of the " Absent Sitter " type, the percentage of
veridicality in the former class was found to be quite double what
it was in the latter ; and a number of individual communicators who
were successful when their surviving relatives were present at the
sitting were complete failures at sittings where they were absent.^
(b) Other things being equal, an " absent sitter " who is personally
known to the actual sitter is probably better situated as a telepathic
agent than one who is unknown both to the actual sitter and to the
medium. This personal link existed in 12 out of Mr Thomas's 24
cases. The basis is far too narrow for confident generalisation ; but
it is at least noteworthy that the three best cases are " personal
link " cases. The fact that five of the remaining " personal link
"
cases were inconclusive or failures does not, pace Mr Thomas, logically
invalidate the possible inference that the existence of such a link is a
condition required for the attainment of the highest degree of
success ; it merely proves that it is not the sole condition.
(9) It is further objected that the telepathic hypothesis does not
satisfactorily account for cross-correspondences, in so far as these
exhibit evidence of conscious design. This is Mr Salter's third
stumbling-block.
This objection leads me on to the most thorny and difficult ground
in the whole field of psychical research—ground which I could not
possibly attempt to traverse in detail at the end of a long paper even
if I felt myself adequately equipped for the task. All that I can do
is to state the general impression which the evidence produces upon
me, without demanding that others should acquiesce in my con-
clusion—or rather, in my absence of conclusions. For there are to
my mind two points in which the evidence of cross-correspondences
is inconclusive. In the first place, I cannot quite convince myself
that in demonstrating pattern or coherence Mr Piddington and other
investigators have conclusively demonstrated design. The patterns
are there, and I do not suggest that their occurrence is in all or even
in most cases due to chance. But suppose we posit that an unde-
signed telepathic infiltration from time to time takes place between
the subconscious minds of certain automatists. What chiefly then

remains to be explained is {a) why the same idea frequently emerges
in two automatists' scripts not in identical but in complementary
forms ; (6) why tlie emergence of a common idea is occasionally
accompanied in the script by some such note as " seek elsewhere for
this ". I cannot feel that either of these peculiarities affords really
clear evidence of design.
(a) As Pigou pointed out in 1909, " complementariness " occurred
without design in a famous telepathic experiment in which Mrs
Verrall was the percipient.^ And. to quote a more recent example,
when the agent txied to make Professor Murray think of Sir Francis
Drake drinking the health of the Elizabethan mutineer Doughty,
what emerged was " a faint feeling of Arabia or desert." ^ In a
cross-correspondence this would have been called a very neat
example of disguised allusion. Again, Osty has recently pointed out
that in the majority of cases of spontaneous telepathy (phantasms
of the dying, etc.) " la representation mentale de I'evenement se fait
par images symboliques, allegoriques, et souvent elle est fragmen-
taire. Les choses se passent comme si le plan cryptique d'intelli-
gence qui prend paranormalement connaissance de I'evenement
lointain ne voulait pas le presenter a I'ordinaire conscience." ^ Does
not this observation adequately account for the much admired
obscurity of our cross-correspondences ? We should expect them,
it seems to me, on the telepathic theory, to be just what they are—
oblique, allusive, and couched in phrases and images which are
linked not by logical coherence but by emotional associations.
These are in fact the common characteristics of subconscious
products, as exemplified in many normal dreams.
(6) It seems not impossible that the consciousness which produces
the script can sometimes distinguish from the general mass of
1 The " One-Horse Dawn" case (Proc, xx. 156-67, 387-94 ; xxv. 109-11).
Mr Piddington subsequently endeavoured to sliow that this case involved
something more than telepathy between the living (Proc, xxx. 175-229,
296-305 ; xxxiv. 159-65) ; but I find the attemj)t more ingenious than con-
vincing. I cannot feel that he has proved, or come within measurable distance
of proving, that a reference to Jebb's note on Oedipus Tyrannus, 846, was
intended by the intelligence responsible for the scripts. But secondly, if
this were proved up to the hilt, there would be no reason, so far as I can
see, for attributing the reference to any other source than the subconscious
mind of Mrs Verrall. That she may have read, and jDrobably had read, the
note in question is not disputed (Proc, xxx. 214). That upon subsequent
study of her own scripts she failed to recognise the alleged reference does not
surprise me at all ; but it need not have surprised even Mr Piddington very
much, in view of what psychoanalysis has taught us about the great strength
and the apparent arbitrariness of subconscious resistances.

endogenous material those impressions which have been telepathi-
cally received, and may even recognise the particular source of the
latter. This is supported by the case of Miss Samuels, who could
usually distinguish the undesigned telepathic impressions received
from Mr Wales both from those she received from Mr Fuller and
from her own endogenous dreams or day dreams.
^
I am not wholly satisfied, therefore, that the cross-correspon-
dences are the result of design. But, secondly, even if they are, I
know of no conclusive answer to the suggestion put forward by
Mangin, Broad and others, that the design of most of those hitherto
published may have originated in the subconscious mind of Mrs
Verrall. It is certainly true that more difficult intellectual feats
than the construction of these puzzles have before now been per-
formed subconsciously ;
that Mrs Verrall possessed just the sort of
literary and linguistic knowledge which would be required for their
construction ; and that in all the more learned and elaborate of the
published cross-correspondences her script played a prominent part.
We shall be in a better position, however, to estimate the value of
this theory when fuller information is available about the later work
of the S.P.R. group of automatists.
(10) It remains to say a word about an objection which though
demonstrably invalid is more frequent than any other on the lips
of the uncritical. The spiritualist hypothesis, people say, is "so
simple ", the telepathic " so complicated ".
If this means merely that the spiritualist explanation is more
easily grasped by the unthinking, the statement is true, but irrele-
vant. We do not prefer Newton's picture of the physical world to
Einstein's because it is more easily apprehended. If it is meant, on
the other hand, that the spiritualist hypothesis is in the scientific
sense simpler, the statement is relevant, but false. To a scientist,
I take it, the simplest hypothesis is that which makes no assumption
unsupported by independent evidence ; the next simplest is that
which makes the fewest and narrowest unsupported assumptions.
Now the telepathic hypothesis assumes ^ that mediums possess a
supernormal faculty for whose reality there is substantial indepen-
dent evidence ; and it assumes further that they possess it in a
degree for which there is a slight amount of independent evidence.
The spiritualist hypothesis assumes
(1) that many, if not all, human personalities survive bodily
death ;
(2) that they retain an accurate memory of many details in
their past lives ;
^ Proc, xxxi. 124 £f.
^ In this comparison I have taken no account of the facts discussed in
connection with objection 6, which seem equally obscure on either hypothesis.
170 Professor E. R. Dodds [part-
(3) that they have a detailed awareness of many physical events
which have occurred among the living since their death ;
(4) that they have in some cases access to the unspoken
thoughts of the living ;
(5) that they can at times communicate with the living, either-
by direct use of the organism of a medium or by telepathi-
cally influencing the medium's subconscious mind ;
(6) that the unspoken wish of a living mind is in some cases
sufficient to initiate this relationship between a particular-
deceased person and a particular medium.
These are I think the minimum assumptions which will cover the
phenomena I have been considering. If the hypothesis is used, as
most of its advocates use it, to explain also book tests, newspaper
tests, and the whole range of physical phenomena, a large number of
additional assumptions are involved. Thus, far from being simple,
the spiritualist hypothesis is hydraheaded. It is in fact not one
hypothesis at all, but a series of hypotheses, of such a character that
no later member of the series is a necessary, or so far as our know-
'
ledge goes a probable, consequence of an earlier member. If the dead
survive, there is no positive probability that they will remember
details of their past lives ; if they survive and remember the past,
there is no positive probability that they will be aware of terrestrial
events after their death ; and so forth. Whatever advantages the
spiritualist view possesses, simplicity in the scientific sense is not one
of them.
I have now considered all the objections known to me which seem
to me to have a prima facie claim to consideration. To sum up my
conclusions, objections 1, 5, 7, 8 and 10 appear to me to have little or
no cogency ;
indeed, all of them are capable of being turned against
their advocates. Objections, 2, 3 and 4 are to a considerable extent
invalidated by evidence obtained under conditions which appear to
exclude spirit agency. Objection 9 I am obliged to write off as
inconclusive, for the reasons I have briefly mentioned. Finally,
objection 6 calls attention to a set of phenomena which I cannot
satisfactorily explain to myself on any theory.
Until, then, some stronger objection emerges, I must grant that
the telepathic hypothesis covers the evidence as well on the whole
as any other ; and since it is the minimum hypothesis which does so,
it commands my provisional acceptance. Until this conclusion is
upset, I must regard survival as unproved ; and I have stated my
reasons for thinking that survival of the kind postulated by spiritua-
lists, though not impossible, is antecedently improbable. It is in
this sense that I do not believe in survival.
I must add that the two current forms of the spiritualist hypo-
thesis—the theory of telepathy from the dead and the theory of
135] Why I Do Not Believe in Survival 171
possession—seem to me to differ widely in their evidential status.
Against the former no conclusive objection has been drawn, or is
hkely to be drawn, from the trance phenomena, for the excellent
reason that we know nothing at all about the conditions which might
govern this kind of telepathy. Against direct possession there is
evidence which I find insuperable. It has been presented by Mrs
Sidgwick in her two masterly papers on the Piper phenomena ;
i
and it is not necessary here to do more than recall its general charac-
ter. The main points are the shiftiness displayed even by highly
veridical communicators like " George Pelham " ;
2 their confident
statements in cases where they can hardly fail to know that they are
lying ;
the habitual lameness of their attempts to answer direct
questions ;
and above all their acceptance of bogus personalities as
genuine spirits (e.g. " George Pelham " guaranteed the authenticity
of" Phmuit ", " Hodgson " upheld the objective reality of a " Bessie
Beals " whom Hall had invented, " Frank Soal " described "
John
Ferguson " as a spirit, and none of Mrs Leonard's communicators,
so far as I know, has given " Feda " away). These facts are not
mcompatible with telepathy from the dead ; but I do not know how
to reconcile them with the theory of direct possession, although I
have read many attempts to do so.
There are other considerations, of a sufficiently obvious kind
which tend to discredit all forms of the spiritualist hypothesis, but
tell most definitely against the theory of possession. It is, I think
fair to say that the " spirits " have so far failed to convey to us any
distinctive impression of their present mode of life, their occupations,
or their state of mind ;
and that they have never explained this
failure. How comes it that these countless Columbuses, returnin<^
to us (if but for an hour) from the supreme voyage of discovery''
describe the life beyond the tomb in terms that are equally applicable
to life m Putney, or alternatively, are borrowed from cheap theo-
sophical literature ? ^ Can the vivid literary talent of a Verrall or
the philosophic insight of a Myers do no more than this ^
And why in
general, do the " spirits " of intellectually gifted persons produce
no evidence that they retain their gifts in the other world ? No
single valuable contribution to art or science has been made, so far
as I know, by an artist or scientist liberated from the material body :
on the contrary, to study spirit communications in bulk, and

Introduction : Technical Methods
1
The psycliological status of Trance Personalities has been a matter
of primary interest to this Society ever since its formation and has,
indeed, engaged the attention of the cmious from the earliest times.
Hitherto, however, our studies have been restricted, almost
without exception, to what I may term " witness-box " methods.
That is to say, we have listened (if we have not been too bigoted) to
the accounts which these personalities have given of themselves ;
we have appUed (if we have been sufficiently critical) a certain
amount of cross-examination, and we have sought to verify the items
M 173
174 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [pabt
of information whicli they have adduced in support of their claims
to identity. In other words, we have treated them almost exactly
as we would treat the claimant to a dukedom, if we had no finger-
prints or Bertillon measurements of the true, but missing, heir. In
particular, we have not hitherto been able to apply those processes
of Measure and Calculation which alone characterise the transition
from speculative enquiry to exact Science.^
The object of the researches here described has been to explore the
possibilities of substituting anthropometrical ^ for legal methods and
of bringing the personaUties concerned out of the witness-box and
into the laboratory.
2
The general method adopted has been that of the Word Associa-
tion Test, use being made, according to circumstances, of the Psycho-
galvanic Reflex, the Reaction Time, and Disturbances in Repro-
duction, as indicators of the effects produced by the stimulus words.
Many readers are doubtless already familiar with this test ; but
I must devote a few paragraphs to it for the benefit of those who are
not.
In principle, the procedure is simple enough. The experimenter
takes a list of quite ordinary words, such as are met with in everyday
life and calls them out, one by one, to the subject, who is preferably
seated comfortably in such a position that he cannot see what is
going on. The rules of the game are that the subject shall respond,
as quicJdy as possible, with thefirst word suggested by the word called
out. This sounds almost too easy to be informative, but certain
complications are involved which may throw considerable light on
the psychological make-up of the person under test.
For instance, the first word suggested may be too embarrassing to
utter, so that it must be replaced by something innocuous ; or what we
may call purely intellectual difliculties may arise ; or the subject may
hesitate between one reply and another. In any of these cases the
time elapsing between calling out the word and receiving the reply
—
known as the Reaction Time—will be longer than the normal, and
this will be an indication that the word has some special significance
for the subject.
More generally, we may say with Jung—the adoptive father of
the technique—that the calling out of any word is equivalent to
confronting the subject " in miniature " with all the situations in
his experience in which the referent and connotations of that word
have played a part.
This is so evidently true that I need not labour the point here ;
and it is, I think, equally clear that we have in this method, in
1 See Appendix III, pp. 220-240, for Technical Notes, to which this and other
numbers in the text refer.
136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 175
principle at least, a means of distingiiisliing personalities by a
substantially direct examination of their psychological content.
For the experience of no two people is the same, and it is this
experience which gives connotational significance to the words ;
so that a standard list will be differently accented, so to speak, for
each individual and comparison of the accentuations should enable
us to distinguish one individual from another.
Moreover, since reaction times and psychogalvanic reflexes can
be measured, and disturbances in reproduction can be counted, we
have, what is all important, a means of obtaining metrical attributes
of the personalities—the psychological analogues of Bertillon
measurements—to which mathematical treatment generally and
the methods of statistical analysis in particular can readily be
applied.
3
Now it has been shown up to the hilt
—
e.g. by Jung and Bleuler ^
—
that the replies given and the reaction times, etc., observed in the
course of the word association test are not determined only by those
stored experiences, which we call memories, that are easily accessible
to consciousness, but also by other factors
—" complexes " and the
like—lying deep in the subconscious or the unconscious.* This,
indeed, stands to reason and we have only to study dreams intelli-
gently, or read such a book as Freud's Psychopathologij of Everyday
Life, to realise how true it is that oxir most superficial actions, our
most apparently inconsequent psychological formulations, are
influenced by the deepest constituents of our beings and not only
by those we can recognise.
This is, of course, very relevant to the whole subject of multiple
personality in the ordinary pathological sense, and this in turn is
closely connected with our present discussion.
In many such pathological cases we know, and in many others we
have no reason to doubt, that the secondary personality shares a
common subconscious with the primary and is, therefore, no more
than the same " psyche "
—if I may be allowed the term—mas-
querading in unfamiliar guise. It is, indeed, only this knowledge—
—or justiflable inference from analogy, as the case may be—that
entitles us to speak of the two or more superficially different per-
sonalities as being " really " the same. Otherwise, we should be
prejudging the whole central problem which has perplexed observers
ever since the first hysteric was judged to be possessed of a devil.
Again, it has been shown
—
e.g. by Prideaux and others—that in
cases of functional amnesia words which were of emotional signi-
ficance in the forgotten part of life arouse abnormally large reactions
when apphed to the amnesic patient.
176 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part
In view of these facts and others like them, we should confidently
expect that the various personalities of any manifold—if I may
adopt a convenient term—would show substantially identical, or at
least significantly similar, reactions when tested in this way.
This view is supported by some experiments of Prince and
Peterson in the EGA case as long ago as 1908.^ Using the psycho-
galvanic reflex as indicator, with the early technique due to Tar-
chanov, they succeeded in eliciting in personality A reactions of
abnormal size, in response to test words relevant to one of B's
dreams of which A had no conscious knowledge.
It follows from the foregoing that if the personalities of mediumis-
tic trance are really no more than secondary personalities of the
medium, as classical psychology would have us suppose, and if
current theories of multiple personality are correct, then we ought
to obtain from the supposed Control or " communicator " sub-
stantially the same reactions as those given by the medium in the
normal state. If we do not, and if the difl^erence is greater than can
reasonably be attributed to chance, then we must conclude that one
or other of these provisos needs revision ; that is to say, either the
Controls are not mere secondaries, or our psychological theories of
multiple personahty must be overhauled.
The general plan, then, is to take a number of sets of reactions
to a given list of words from the normal personality and an equal
number of sets from the trance personality, to compare the two
aggregates of figures so obtained, and to calculate the probability
that any resemblance or difference between them has arisen by
chance alone—that is, by the operation of all those uncontrolled
and unknown factors which, taken together, we call Error.
This last part of the procedixre is, in an important sense, the most
indispensable of all ;
for, strictly speaking, no result is worth
anything until we know just how much it is worth.
4
I first suggested this method as far back as 1921, when I showed,
using the psychogalvanic reflex and a correlational method of
computation, that it was possible to distinguish normal people from
each other and to identify them with themselves on different
occasions by these means.®
But the honour (if honour it prove to be, as I hope it may) of
having first attempted to apply the technique to the mediumistic
trance goes to my near-namesake Mr Hereward Carrington, who is
well known to students of Psychical Research and is now Director
of the recently formed American Psychical Institute. In 1932 and
1933 he carried out, unknown to me, a series of tests with Mrs Eileen
136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 177
Garrett and her Control " Uvani " (whom I have also studied) and
the results were published in the first Bulletin of the Institute
mentioned. The fact that these results were not at all conclusive,
as was at first supposed by himself and by certain uncritical en-
thusiasts, has been in no way his fault but must be attributed
entirely to ignorance of the psychological, physical and mathe-
matical technicalities involved, on the part of those on whose
assistance he relied. It is only fair to emphasise this here in view
of the criticism to which the work in question must elsewhere be
subjected. After all we do not blame, but rather praise, a pioneer
aviator who succeeds in getting only to Newfoundland and not to
Florida, if he has been provided with an unreliable compass, a
twisted drift-sight and a misprinted Nautical Almanack.
This seems a convenient point at which to acknowledge most
gratefully my own contrasting indebtedness to those who have
helped me in the work I am about to describe.
First, of course, there are the three mediums, Mrs Garrett, Herr
Rudi Schneider and Mrs Osborne Leonard, on whom the tests were
made. Next the various Controls and " communicators " them-
selves, for, whatever their psychological status may ultimately prove
to be, they have been uniformly obliging in this matter.
I am also greatly indebted to Mr Theodore Besterman for collect-
ing the data for me in the cases of Mrs Garrett and of Ptudi Schneider
and, particularly, for suggesting that I should make a study of the
latter as an integral part of the work being done on his mediumship
as a whole.
In the case of Mrs Leonard I am under a deep obligation to Mr
Drayton Thomas, not only for performing the same somewhat
tiresome function, but also for most generously devoting a large
number of his private sittings to the research and for enlisting the
invaluable co-operation of his two " communicating controls." Mr
Besterman, in his capacity of Investigation Ofiicer to this Society,
might almost be described as a professional chaser of the wild-goose
eggs found in mares' nests, and is correspondingly inured to every
form of thankless and wearisome investigation—though this, of
course, in no way detracts from the value of his work here ; but Mr
Drayton Thomas is well known as a convinced, if critical, supporter
of the spiritistic view of these phenomena, and I think, if I may say
so without impertinence, that it speaks volumes for the genuineness
of his scientific outlook that he should so willingly have begun and
so enthusiastically have continued a long and tedious research—
a
research which he must have thought at best superfluous and one
which might quite possibly produce results notably damaging to his
most cherished convictions.
Above all, I wish to express and to emphasise my gratitude to
178 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part
Professor Fisher, now occupying tlie Chair of Genetics at London
University. Whatever success this research may be deemed to
have achieved is—given the observations—almost entirely due to
him ;
for, if he had not developed his elegant and powerful Analysis
of Variance, the results could not, I think, have been obtained at all
;
while, if he had not personally guided my uncertain footsteps at
every stage of the analysis, I should still be floundering in the morass
of my own ineptitudes. The responsibility for the way in which
I have applied his methods is, on the other hand, entirely mine.
5
I will now turn to a somewhat closer examination of the technique
used, and will begin with the psychogalvanic reflex, to which I have
already alluded more than once.
I want it clearly understood that there is no magic whatever about
the psychogalvanic reflex. This formidable name refers merely to
a decrease in the apparent electrical resistance of the subject's
skin, and such a decrease takes place (in normal subjects, at any rate)
whenever any stimulus is apphed. It is true that, in spite of many
years of study by numerous experimenters, there is still some
difference of ojiinion as to precisely what causes it, as to the nervous
mechanisms which control it, and as to what it is that it indicates.
For some say that it indicates " emotion," while others say " cona-
tion " and yet others (of whom I myself was formerly one) prefer to
speak of " affective tone." Mercifully, none of this matters for our
present purpose ; we are only interested in the undisputed facts
that the decrease in apparent resistance is an easily measurable
quantity and that it is positively correlated with the degree of
psychological disturbance—of whatever kind this may be—that
takes place when a stimulus is applied. We shall do best to think
of it, in this context, merely as a measurable part of the total
preparation for action which takes place in the subject as a result
of confronting him " in miniature," as we have put it, with the
situations recalled by the stimulus word.
Similarly there is nothing in the least remarkable about the
apparatus we used for its measurement, except that it was specially
designed for portability. It consists merely of an ordinary Wheat-
stone's bridge—the standard instrument for measuring electrical
resistance—provided with the usual knobs and dials for reading
the magnitude of the resistance to which it is applied (in this case the
resistance of the subject) and it is fitted with a built-in galvanometer
of a portable reflecting type, built-in batteries, sensitivity control
and the usual switching arrangements. For a description of the
apparatus, see Appendix I.
136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 179
On the other hand, a few words may be of interest as to the way
in which it is used. The standard method, so to speak, which I
employed successfully in all my early work of 1920-21, consists in
using a pair of circular zinc-plate electrodes, about two inches in
diameter (in the Garrett-Uvani experiments they were 44 mm.),
covered with chamois leather soaked in salt solution, and applied to
the palm and back of the subject's left hand. The whole is padded
with cotton wool and may conveniently be bandaged to a splint to
minimize mechanical movement between the hand and the elec-
trodes. Such mechanical movements tend to loosen one contact or
the other and thereby to increase resistance, thus reducing or
nullifying the effect we are seeking to observe and even producing,
in many cases, a negative deflexion of the galvanometer.
This procedure works well for most ordinary people. So far as I
can remember, I have met only about three, in a hundred or so
tested, for whom it did not ; but there are a few, who have a very
high resistance and a tendency to erratic response, for whom more
drastic methods are necessary. For these we now use " foot-bath
"
electrodes, such as are employed for work with electro-cardiographs.
These consist of porcelain tanks containing the salt solution, in
which the subject's feet are immersed, while special compartments
contain zinc-plate electrodes, which accordingly do not make direct
mechanical contact with the subject. This plan lowers resistance
and practically eliminates the effects of muscular movement. It is
the preferable procedure for all cases where there is any uncertainty
as to the magnitude and reliability of the response obtainable with
the simpler type of hand electrodes, which I should now use only in
emergency or for specially good subjects. A still later plan, more
convenient in many cases, is to use the foot-baths as hand-baths in
which the hands and forearms of the subject are immersed, suitable
transverse " grips " being provided to help in reducing casual
movement.
It will be understood that what is actually measured is simply
the movement of the spot of light given by the galvanometer along
the scale attached to the latter, and that this movement is a measure
of the resistance change produced in the subject's skin by the disturb-
ance caused when the stimulus word is called out and answered.
Suitable corrections
—
e.g., for sensitivity and for the voltage
applied to the bridge—must, of course, be applied before the
deflexions noted during the experiment are subjected to analysis.^
6
I pass to a consideration of the reaction times. These are, of
course, easy enough to measure ; for all that is needed is to use an
180 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part
ordinary stop-watcli, reading fifths of seconds, start it as the
stimulus word is called out (preferably on the accented syllable of
polysyllabic words), and stop it as the reply is given (again prefer-
ably on the accented syllable). The time thus recorded is the reac-
tion time, and there is only one remark worth making here, namely,
that any constant error on the part of the observer—or, indeed, any
constant lag on the part of the subject—is automatically eliminated
in the course of the subsequent analysis.
There are, however, two points connected with the use of reaction
times, which are of very great importance, for ignorance of one
might easily mislead and ignorance of the other might altogether
vitiate otherwise valuable work.
The first is that differences in the actual mean magnitude of
reaction time, taken over a series of words, do not necessarily imply,
or even presumptively indicate, a difference of individuality between
the personalities concerned. That is to say, if one personality gives
an average reaction time of two seconds for a list of words and
another gives an average of two seconds and a half, this is by no
means necessarily an indication of non-identity in the sense that
interests us here, even if the difference is shown by analysis not to
be attributable to chance. Such a result could be brought about
by many causes, such as drugs or fatigue or even a change of " mood "
and it is, indeed, just the kind of difference which might reasonably
be expected to accompany the trance state, as a part, perhaps, of
the subconsciously determined impersonation undertaken by a
secondary personality. We are interested only in the differential
incidence, as regards personalities, of prolongation of reaction time
among the various words of the list.
The second point may be explained as follows : In the case of the
psychogalvanic reflex it is easy to see that there are plenty of physical
and physiological reasons why the deflexion obtained cannot be
indefinitely large. The subject's resistance cannot drop to zero
(I am talking of ordinary deflexions and neglecting the not-impos-
sible effects of the e.m.f. mentioned in Note 7) and even if it did, the
resistance of the leads and electrodes, etc., would ensure a finite de-
flexion. To the first approximation, at any rate, we are accordingly
entitled to take the deflexion as a definite numerical measure of the
disturbance produced, which indeed, unless we call introspection to
our aid, can only be stated in terms of the magnitudes we measure.
But there is nothing in principle to prevent a reaction time being
prolonged indefinitely ; there is only the moral effect of its being
an experiment and not a child's game (and possibly theforce majeure
of the experimenter) to prevent the subject postponing the reply for
ten minutes or till the week after next. Consequently, very long
reaction times are apt not to be significant in proportion to their
136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 181
length. If the average is one second, for example, a time of one
second and a half probably means something ; but a time of three
seconds will mean little more, while one of ten will almost certainly
mean no more at all than that of three.
^
Now the effect of such meaninglessly long times, occurring at
random, cannot be to produce spurious eifects of similarity, for
similarities depend, as is easily understood, on coincidences, as
between the personalities, of long or short times on the same words,
and the chance of this occurring by accident is taken care of in the
analysis. But they might produce spurious effects of difference, as
can be understood at once by imagining two idealised sets of identi-
cally similar reactions (which would, of course, give perfect simi-
larity) and then considering the effect of adding random increases
to the entries in one of them. We must, accordingly, be very much
on our guard against this effect, if ever we meet with apparent
differences between personalities based on reaction times. My own
practice is to write double the mean value (or, better, double the
median value for all values greater than this, and to compute on
the basis of the figures thus obtained. My experience leads me to
beheve that this is just about right ;
but, pending further ad hoc
research, I am not in a position to defend this procedm-e against
anyone who likes to contend that one and a half times the mean, say,
or two and a half times the mean, are better " cut-off " points.
In certain cases of critical importance, therefore, I have resorted
to an over-drastic test by writing simply the value one for all values
greater than the mean (or median, as the case may be) and zero for
all values less than it. This procedure, of course, sacrifices all the
information there may be in the gradations of the times and I
accordingly use it only occasionally as a crucial qualitative test and
rely on my " double the mean " plan for comparative work, where
the error introduced, if any, will become what I may loosely term
a second order effect depending on the differences between errors
themselves already small.
Since writing the above I have begun a comprehensive study of
the points involved and hope to be shortly in a position to propose a
completely standardised procedure for dealing with both reaction
time and psychogalvanic reflex data in this and other respects.
Some such standardization is essential in order that results obtained
in differing circumstances or by different workers may be truly
comparable.
7
Thirdly, there is what is known as the reproduction test.
When the experimenter has gone through the list, noting the
reaction times, the psychogalvanic reflexes and the words given in
182 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part
reply to the stimuli, he goes through it a second time, asking the.
subject to reply, if possible, with the same word that was first given
in association. Failure to do this, or prolonged hesitation in doing
so, is counted as a " disturbance in reproduction," and the incidence
of these disturbances among the various words of the Hst affords
another basis for deciding whether the personalities concerned are
similar or different.
This " complex indicator," to use the technical term, is one of
exceptional merit,i^ mainly on account of the almost complete lack
of extraneous error connected with it ; and it has the additional
advantage of being exceptionally easy to compute, since all the
entries are necessarily either one or zero.
8
In addition to these three tests, I have done a considerable
amount of work on other possible sources of information, notably
on the Form of the Association ; that is to say, on the grammatical
form of the response and on the logical or grammatical relation
between it and the stimulus word. But I have definitely come to
the conclusion that, in the present state of the art, the method is
substantially valueless.
It is easy enough, on the face of it, to classify the words or the
relationships under different headings and to compute the chance
that the numbers thus obtained for different personalities agree or
disagree by accident to the observed extent. I have, indeed, ob-
tained some most striking results by this method—for example, all
the four personahties dealt with in the case of Mrs Leonard and
described below appeared to be sharply separable by this means.
But I have yet to find a system of classification which is both
unambiguous and psychologically relevant, so that I was left with
the uneasy feeling that I could quite well have produced entirely
different results with almost equal plausibility.
I have accordingly abandoned the method, for the present, as an
instrument of research, though I think it by no means impossible
that special study might lead to a scheme capable of yielding very
valuable results.
I have also tried other plans, such as the study of grammatical
form alone, of the ways in which complex indicators are combined,
and even of such preferences as are shown for initial letters for the
response words. But none of these have yielded any results of
statistical significance one way or the other, and I have accordingly
fallen back on the three classical indicators already described.
i
136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Perso7ialities 183
9
I have no time for more than a very few words on the subject of
the beautiful and searching method, known as the Analysis of
Variance, whereby the data obtained have been examined. (The
general procedure is illustrated in Appendix II.)
If we inspect a mass of reactions obtained from two different
personalities in response to the same set of stimulus words, we
notice, of course, that, in general they differ one from another.
These differences are due to a number of causes ; one personality,
for example, may be, on the whole, more sluggish in reply, or less
sensitive as regards the reflex, than the other ; the various words are
responsible for marked differences of reaction ; and there will be
differences also corresponding to the several occasions on which the
personalities have been tested—greater sensitivity on one day, less
on another, and so forth. In addition to these clearly identifiable
factors there operates a host of incalculable minor influences
—
ranging from distractions during the course of the experiment to the
trivial incidents of the medium's daily life and thought—and these,
i
collectively, make up error.
Now, what I may colloquially term the " overall differentness " of
the hypothetical " population," of which the observations form a
sample, is known as its Variance and to it contribute all the various
factors I have mentioned. The function of the technique is to sort
out the contributions made from the various sources, to express
j
them in comparable form and, by comparing them with each other,
to determine the probability of the similarities or differences
existing between the reactions obtained from the different per-
sonalities being the result of chance alone.
It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of the last few words.
Anyone can manipulate figures and get an answer of sorts ; and all
too many people do. But unless that answer is backed by a proba-
bility telling us what degree of reliance may be placed on it, it is
(likely to be worse than useless.
In Science it is the Probability Integral, rather than Faith, that
is " the assurance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not
seen."

Part II
Experiments and Results : Interpretation
10
At last I come to the experiments conducted and the results
obtained from them.
The first case to be investigated was that of Mrs Garrett and her
control " Uvani," who, incidentally, purports to be an Arab and not
to know English except, I gather, through the intermediacy of the
medium.
These two personalities were tested at six double sittings,"*
and Mr Besterman, as aheady noted, was responsible for collecting
the data, which comprised all three indicators.
Copies of these observations, as of all others mentioned in this
paper, are preserved among the Society's archives.
The list of one hundred words used was the same that I em-
ployed in my original work on the differences between normal
persons. It was derived from that given by Dr Eder, in his Intro-
duction to Jung's Studies in Word Association, by deleting the
twenty words which I had previously found to give the largest
psychogalvanic reflexes, on the average, when applied to about
100 normal subjects, and replacing them with twenty others which
I judged likely to be less exciting.
The reason for doing this in the first instance was that I feared lest
the inclusion of many words of great common interest—such as
those bearing on erotic life and the like—might obscure individual
differences in respect of other matters. In the present case I was
again influenced by these considerations, hut also by the knowledge
that this list had already worked well. The order of the words was
suitably varied from sitting to sitting.
No difficulty was experienced in obtaining reaction times or
verbal responses from either personality, each of whom, especially
Mrs Garrett, had had previous practice with Mr Hereward Carrington
in America.
11
On the other hand, Mrs Garrett proved to be by far the worst
subject for the psychogalvanic reflex that I have ever worked with,
while Uvani was little better, if at all. I have met, perhaps, so
many as three or four persons of this high-resistance, erratic-
response type before, but having previously had ample material to
draw on, I discarded them at once in favour of more amenable
subjects. We could not do this here, since mediums of Mrs Garrett's:
136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 185
calibre are not too easy to come by, so we struggled on doing the
best we might and finally obtained some 520 positive deflexions of a
sort, from the two personalities together, out of the 1200 aimed at.
There were also 92 reasonably definite negative deflexions of no
interest to us and ascribable to mechanical movement, while the
remaining 588 attempts to obtain a reading failed to give anything
worth writing down.
We used the hand electrodes throughout, hoping always that
better results would be obtained next time ; but I think now that
I ought to have suspended the work after the first sitting and adopted
foot-bath electrodes at once.^'
These data (the 520 positive deflexions referred to) were far too
fragmentary for treatment by the Analysis of Variance, which de-
mands for its operation a compact array of figures without gaps.
I was accordingly forced to employ the far cruder technique of
correlation, which I had used in my early work, and this itself was
reduced in value by the many gaps in the material.
I shall not trouble the reader with a detailed account ^® of this
work ;
for, although it occupied me for very many weeks, nothing
unquestionably significant came of it.
None the less it is noteworthy that, no matter whether I dealt
with the actual ohmic changes produced, or with the most elabo-
rately corrected derivatives of these ; or whether I used the
classical method of correlation, or that by " ranks " (which there is
some reason for doing with material so bad as this ; or whether
I eliminated or did not eliminate two words (" Frog " in the case of
Garrett and " Dog " in the case of Uvani) which seemed unduly to
influence the results,^^ I always obtained a much stronger suggestion
of difference than of similarity.
As a matter of fact, I obtained one result to the effect that the
chance of the observed difference being accidental was no more
than 1 in about 600 ; but in view of the general unsatisfactoriness
of the material, I do not care to rely much on this figure.
12
The reaction times, however, told a far clearer story. In this
case I was obliged to discard the first sitting altogether, because the
oflGicial stop-watch broke down in the middle of it ; but none the less
Mr Besterman obtained for me a good compact mass of 91 words
at each of five double sittings—a total of 910 observations. Such
an aggregate is readily handled by the Analysis of Variance—
•
bnce one knows how—and Professor Fisher himself very kindly
dealt with the first fifty words for me in order to illustrate the
procedure.
1
186 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part
Actually, I worked these figures four times ;
first with tlie un-
corrected "
data ;
second, writing double the mean for all values
greater than this ;
third, writing 1 for all above the mean and 0 for
all below it ; and finally doing the same thing but using the median
instead of the mean.^^
All four procedures led to the same result. There was found, m
each case, either a wholly negligible similarity or none at all,
together with a highly significant difference.
The chances of this difference being accidental were found to be
about one in ten miUions, one in one million, one in ten thousand,
and one in ten million respectively.
Incidentally, this goes far to confirm the very approximate
correctness of the plan of using double the mean for all greater values.
13
I also analysed the disturbances in reproduction in this case.
Unfortunately a great many replies took the form of " No " or
" I don't know," and it is scarcely reasonable to maintain that the
repeating of such negations constitutes undisturbed reproduction.
I was accordingly obliged to omit these words, with the result that
the data became nearly as fragmentary as those for the psycho-
galvanic reflex.
I obtained, however, an unbroken block of 26 words, which I
treated by Analysis of Variance,^* and I also appUed another
method, known as Contingency, to the comparable pairs of rephes,
working through the data sitting by sitting.^^
The two procedures agreed in showing a significant difference
between the two personalities, the chance of this difference being
accidental amounting to probably much less than one in one
hundred.
14
Combining the results from these two sources of reaction time and
reproduction test—which are quite independent—and allowing
ourselves the modest make-weight of a one in ten chance from the|
psychogalvanic reflexes, we conclude that, in respect of the range
of interests covered by the words of the list, these two personalities
are significantly different—different, that is to say, to an extent
that would arise by chance only once in some thousand million
trials. 2®
They show, therefore, no sign of sharing a common subconscious
content in the way that the classical view of multiple personality
would lead us to expect.
136] The Qua7ititative Study of Trance Personalities 187
15
The next case to be studied was that of the well-known " physi-
cal " medium, Herr Eudi Schneider, and his Control " Olga," who
purports to be, I understand, the surviving consciousness of one
Lola Montez, once well known as an artiste and otherwise.
As already mentioned, this investigation was suggested to me by
Mr Besterman with a view to its forming a part of a wider study of
Herr Schneider's mediumship which was then in progress, but it
developed, as will be seen, into a very valuable contribution to my
own work.
The data were again collected for me by Mr Besterman^'' and con-
sisted of the psychogalvanic reflexes and reaction times elicited in
response to one hundred German words adapted by Mr Besterman
from Jung's own list.^^" The words of this list largely resembled,
either by actual equivalence or close affinity, those used for Mrs
Garrett, but a number of special words were included which I shall
discuss below.
Foot-bath electrodes were used for the psychogalvanic reflex with,
on the whole, very satisfactory results. There was no trouble with
negative deflexions, the subject's resistance was low and deflexions
of good size were easily elicited.
There was still a considerable number of readings spoiled for one
reason or another and the first of the six double sittings had to be
discarded altogether. We obtained, however, an unbroken block of
56 words for each of the other five, making a satisfactory total of
560 items for analysis.
This analysis disclosed a highly significant similarity between
the two personalities, the chance of its being accidental amount-
ing to something less than one in one hundred thousand. No
more than a faint and wholly insignificant trace of difference was
discernible.^"
I may say in parenthesis that once we get into these high figures
(or, rather, these microscopic chances) the presence of a few zeros
more or less may be disregarded. We obtain a measure of difference
or similarity, as the case may be, the nature of which I shall discuss
below, and the chances which I cite are measures not of these
quantities but of our confidence in them. This confidence naturally
increases with the number of data available, so that once it has
become high we know that it is only a matter of going on long enough
to obtain any specified chance we like, however small, assuming
relevant conditions to remain unaltered. It would, therefore, be
quite erroneous to conclude that Eudi and Olga are less definitely
similar than Garrett and Uvani are different ; for the results ob-
tained from the latter pair are based on 910 items of information and
188 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part
those for the former on only 560 ; and even this leaves out the
question of the varying degree of error in the two cases. We are
entitled to say that our estimate of the Garrett-Uvani difference is
likely to be somewhat nearer the true value than our estimate of the
Kudi-Olga similarity ; but the fact of significant difference and the i
fact of significant similarity may be regarded as coercively established
^
in the two cases.
16
I mentioned just now that the list contained a number of special
words. These were inserted with a view to throwing light, if
possible, on Rudi's (and Olga's) attitude towards the genuineness of
the phenomena alleged to occur in his presence.
When I analysed the data, I did not know which these words
were ; but I selected ten, which seemed to be relevant and to have
aroused especial interest to judge by an inspection of the reflexes |
they produced. I should add that no others appeared to have any |
bearing on the subject and that these ten did actually include all
those chosen by Mr Besterman for this purpose.
These words were : aufpassen, Gesetz, streitenjahcl, Angst, Geist,
drohen, Sclmindel, Vorsicht, vertrauen. They may fairly be trans-
lated : Beware, Law (hence, rules, conditions, etc.). Have a row with
(hence controversy, etc.), False, Fear (or anxiety), Spirit, Threaten,
Fraud, Caution, Trust (hence distrust, suspicion, etc.). It is easyl
to see that all these words are likely to arouse, directly or in-
1
directly, thoughts of fraud and suspicion, fear of exposure (if there is|
any) and the like. . I
In order to see what kind of importance these words had, I with-il
drew them from the aggregate and analysed afresh the data corre-
sponding to the remaining 46 words. I still obtained a definitely
significant similarity,^! the chance of its being accidental coming to
,
no more than about 1 in 250, so that it cannot plausibly be main-
j
tained that the observed similarity is due to a strong common ji
interest shared by two distinct individuals. On the other hand, the ;
'
similarity is diminished to such an extent that this group of ideas, ;
j
associated with fraud and suspicion, may fairly be said to dominate
the psychic life of the joint personality, which we may term RuD-j
OLGA. It I were pressed to desert purism for a moment in the 1
interests of vividness, I would hazard the opinion that this group of
ideas is responsible for something like one-third of the total similarity
observed.
This is the more noteworthy in view of the fact that the list con-
tained a good number of words connected with such almost univer-
sally interesting topics as love, sickness and death.^s
Even those with a weakness for illogical distinctions without
136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 189
difference must, I think, admit that if Eudi and Olga are—in some
mystical and transcendental sense—not " the same " they are, at
any rate, " two minds with but a single thought, two hearts that beat
IS one ".
17
The reaction times given by Eudi were of peculiar interest.
In the first place they Avere very short, averaging about 1-9 second,
as compared with about 2-5 for Mrs Garrett, 3-8 for Uvani and 4-5
ifor the whole Leonard group to be discussed later. {N.B. Olga was
very much longer, with a mean of no less than 8-4 seconds, but this
may be attributed to the pecuUarities of the " trance " state and is
not relevant to the present issue.)
Secondly, they maintained a most remarkable dead level of
magnitude, showing extraordinarily little variation from word to
w^ord.^^ This is of importance for the following reasons :
My imperfect acquaintance with the German language has pre-
ivented me making as thorough a study of the replies given as I could
(wish ; but two things are quite clear to me even under this handicap.
First, there is a very high proportion indeed of replies which seem
;. to have no connection whatever with the stimulus word ;
second,
,j
of these irrelevant replies, a considerable number—of the order of
,
fifteen or twenty per cent, I should judge—appear to be determined
,y
by the immediately preceding word, or by one only two or three
J.
places removed from it.
jj
!
When we find the first of these features—irrelevance—coupled
with an abnormally long reaction time (as in some of the early
I,.
Leonard sittings) we may confidently attribute it to " mind-
^ wandering." But when we find it coupled with an abnormally
\ short time we cannot but suspect that the subject has been making
•Ijiup his mind what to reply before he hears the stimulus word. And
J.
'
this view is strengthened by the apparent borrowing of associations
f'from near-by words. I have counted some fifty cases of this
j
apparent borrowing in the first three Eudi sittings, whereas, in the
; whole of the rest of the material examined, I have noticed only some
({
half-dozen examples of this happening.
p. I necessarily speak with difiidence here ; but the strong impression
j5
I gather from the data as a whole is that Eudi, far from co-operating
,['
properly in the test, was attempting rather to follow a plan of
campaign well calculated to obscm-e the issues involved.
18
I-
When these times were compared with those of Olga and analysed,
further points of some interest emerged.
190 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part
I first treated the raw data, without applying corrections of any
kind. This gave me a highly significant difference between Rudi
and Olga—a surprising and almost unbelievable contradiction of the
even stronger similarity I had obtained from the psychogalvanic
reflexes. When, however, I wrote double the mean for every value
greater than this {of. 6 above) and re-analysed, I found negligible!
indications of difference and similarity alike—the latter being, if
anything the less feeble of the two. When I applied the still morei
drastic " one or zero " method, which I have already mentioned
i
(using the mean as the critical value), I obtained a difference of
rather less than nothing, if I may loosely put it so, and a similarityj
which, though scarcely significant statistically, was quite well
marked.^*
It is clear that this procedure, by eliminating the cause of spurious
difference already noted, has yielded a result conforming both to the
decisive answer given by the reflexes and to the known inferiority
of the reaction time data.
These points are not without an interest of their own, but
the real value of the Rudolga investigation to the main structure of
this paper is that it shows clearly that, when we are confronted
with two apparently different personalities which are really one and
the same, the method proclaims them to be so with no uncertain
voice.
From the methodological standpoint, in which I am far more
interested here than in demonstrating any particular conclusion,
the importance of this can hardly be over-estimated. We should]
look with grave suspicion on our fine new telescope if it showed
every star in the heavens as double !
19
I think that having gone so far, almost anyone might be excused
for supposing that all we had to do in future was to sit back in our,
chairs and sort out pairs of personalities into similar sheep and dis
similar goats. Such, however, is far from being the case, and when
I came to deal with the Leonard group of personalities, which I shall
now discuss, I was faced with intricacies of relationships involving
corresponding difficulties in analysis.
I must accordingly ask for close attention while I develop an
argument which cannot fail to be complicated ; and I can only
hope that the reader will not find it so hard to follow as I have found
it to prepare.
Through the great kindness of Mr. Drayton Thomas, as already
mentioned, I was able to study, in the case of Mrs Leonard, no fewer
than four personalities. These were : first, Mrs. Leonard in her
I
iSSC
MI
wi
bee
M
136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 191
normal state (but see section 29 below) ;
second, her Control
'
Feda," who—as most readers probably know—usually takes
charge of the trance and purports to act as a kind of intermediary
between the would-be communicators and the sitter ;
third, the late
'
Reverend John Wesley Thomas—father of Mr Drayton Thomas ;
and, fourth, Mr Drayton Thomas' sister, nee Miss Etta Thomas and
daughter, therefore, of the Reverend John. These two appear to
!
be able to control the medium—if I may be allowed spiritistic terms
:
for a moment—almost as well as Feda herself ; and it was, of course,
while they were doing so that their reactions were taken.
I shall refer to these four personalities, for the sake of brevity, as
L, F, J and E respectively.
20
Most unfortunately, we were unable to use the psychogalvanic
reflex in this case. Mrs Leonard herself, I hasten to add, was very
willing ; but there were external obstacles which could not be
surmounted and we were accordingly forced to rely on the reaction
times, reproduction test and response words only. This, as may be
i imagined, was a heavy handicap, especially as all four personalities
j
gave very long times all round and I was by no means sure that the
'
variations in these would be sufficient to give definite results.
In any event, the task of determining the relationships within a
fourfold personality with the aid of nothing more elaborate than a
common stop-watch may reasonably be described as formidable.
I may say here, in parenthesis, that the response given to the
words of the list showed a most striking concordance with the
professed characters of the personalities concerned. Thus J was
rich in scriptural allusions and references to church matters, E in
associations constellated by reminiscences of ill health and F in
words having a more or less Oriental flavour.
As I have already explained, I have not yet been able to devise a
satisfactory method of subjecting responses to mathematical
treatment, but it is greatly to be hoped that ]\'Ir Drayton Thomas
—
who is far better qualified to do so than I—will see his way in dis-
cussing this aspect of the research in a special communication.
The main experiments consisted of six quadruple sittings and
the same list of words was used that did duty in the Garrett-Uvani
j
work. But it was found that we could not count on getting more
than 75 reactions from each personality, because the work seemed
to exhaust somewhat rapidly the " power "—whatever that may be
—on which the process of " control " depends. For this reason,
also, we obtained no reactions at all from E for the second sitting,
I
because the power gave out after taking a himdred each from
L, F and J.
I
192 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part
Thus the comparisons discussed below are based on six sets of
seventy-five words for each personality, except when E is involved,
and then on five sets of seventy-five.
Extra reactions, up to a total of one hundred, were actually taken
on a number of occasions, in the hope that the responses might be
used statistically ; but this hope proved illusory, as already ex-
plained. '
21
Now in studying a quadruple manifold of this kind, the most
natural thing to do, perhaps, would be to throw all four personalities
into hotch-potch—as the lawyers say—and apply a test to the total
mass of data to see whether, taken as a whole, it is substantially
homogeneous or not.
Unfortunately, we cannot allow ourselves so simple a procedure
as this ;
because, although the result would be extremely striking
if the mass were found not to be homogeneous, we might easily be
misled if it were.
Suppose, for example, that Feda were a clearly distinguishable
personality, bearing the same relation to Mrs Leonard that Uvani
iDears to Mrs Garrett, and suppose also that she were capable of
assuming diverse superficially different forms while remaining
fundamentally the same—as a well-behaved secondary personaHty
should do. Then the sameness between F, J and E might easily so
obscure the difference between F and L, if all were treated together,
that we should conclude that the whole manifold was homogeneous,
whereas actually it would not be.
It is accordingly necessary to take the personalities by pairs and
ascertain what relationship exists between the members of each.
There are, of course, six such pairs to be studied, namely L and F,
L and J, L and E ; F and J, F and E ; and J and E.
I accordingly analysed each of these pairs in turn and obtained
the following results for similarity based on the reaction times.

Now I cannot discuss the mathematics of the subject here ; but
it will not be misleading to regard the figures in the column headed z

as measures of tlie similarity between the personalities concerned
—though somewhat clouded, of course, by error—and those in
the column headed P as the chances that these apparent similari-
ties have arisen by accident. Thus the smaller the value of P the
greater our confidence in the measure of similarity to which it
belongs.
It will be noticed that the closest similarity is between L and J
—not between L and F as we might, perhaps, expect—and that we may
feel practically certain that this is genuine ; L and F, with J and E,
come next and we may feel quite confident about them also ; the
similarities between L and E and between F and J are rather small
and their associated P's rather high, so that we have not much
confidence in them ; while there is no similarity at all between F
and E, so that the question of confidence does not arise.
22

These figures naturally do not correspond exactly with those
obtained from the reaction times ; and it would be very odd if they
did, for the two tests clearly involve appreciably different processes.
The reaction time test is a matter of finding a word with which to
reply, while the reproduction test is one of remembering which word
you found. The results of the two should give somewhat similar
results (and they do), but there is scarcely more reason why they
should be identical than those obtained by examining school
children in Mathematics and in French.
The relatively very great similarity between J and E should be
noticed here—a similarity consistent with their supposed relation-
ship of father and daughter. This similarity is well above the
average for reaction times also.
194 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part
23
Another point of considerable interest may be brought out as
follows :
-11
Let us take the average similarity of each personality with the
other three and arrange these averages in order of magnitude.
This gives us :
Foe Keaction Times. For Keproductions.
L - - -2731 J - - -4045
J - - -2473 E - - -3486
E - - -1227 F - - -3166
F - - -1037 L - - -2589
Notice here how J and E keep together in each case and par-
ticularly how the J factor, so to speak, dominates the scene in the
reproduction test and is second in the case of the reaction times.
On the whole it is markedly J whom the others most resemble—not
L as one might expect. We shall find this tendency again and again,
and I have no hesitation in saying that, if the four sets of figures had
simply been marked W, X, Y and Z and given to someone to analyse
who did not know which was which, he would have come to the
conclusion that the one corresponding to J was the " highest common
factor " in the group and would have surmised that this was the
normal medium.
It is also interesting to note—though I do not want anyone to
attach a grain more importance to it than he wishes—that F least
resembles the others in the matter of reaction time, where some
element of word-selection is involved and likeness of vocabulary is
calculated to promote similarity. This is curiously consistent with
Feda's claim to be of Indian birth, so that English would be an
acquired language to her, and with her habit of talking somewhat
childishly. If F is a secondary personality of L, in the classical
sense, she certainly seems to play her part with an extraordinary
attention to detail ;
but, on the other hand, it might be rash to
wager very heavily on the vaUdity of the indication obtained.
24
I must now ask my readers' indulgence while I digress to discuss
a point which must already have been perplexing some of them,
especially those who are accustomed to deaUng with statistics.
" Why,"—it has probably been wondered—" having discovered
pretty strong similarities in five cases out of six, is it not frankly
admitted that we are dealing with a straightforward case of quad-
ruple personality and have done with it ? Is not all this talk about
:l36] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 195
differences of similarity and the dominance of one factor rather than
another, and all the rest of it, no more than a somewhat disingenous
attempt to discover dilferences where none exist and so pave the
way for a fanciful interpretation of facts which could be simply
explained ?
"
With this feeling, if it exists, I have every sympathy ; for it is
not unnatural on the facts so far presented in the manner I have so
far presented them.
None the less, I propose to reserve my main defence for a moment,
and I will ask the reader to follow me in an argument which I believe
|i to be in some degree novel, which is certainly important, and likely,
I think, to convince him that the differences I have been discussing
are not artifacts, but genuine differences worthy of examination.
I want those who are conversant with statistical practice to forget,
and the others not to think of, the ideas of " populations " and
" samples " which form, so to say, the current coin of statistical
small talk.
I want to discuss the matter rather in terms of such everyday
objects as Automatic Machines—the kind of things one finds on
railway stations, where one puts in a penny and takes out a packet
I
of butterscotch or a good cigar. The resemblance of such a machine
ito a medium under test is very close ; there is only the trifling
!
difference that instead of a coin one puts in a stimulus word and
instead of a packet of butterscotch one takes out a reaction time,
jit would, indeed, be easy enough, in principle, to design a machine
I
which in answer to a word called out to it would reply with another
after an interval determined by the nature of the word called out.
Consider two of these machines and imagine that each has slots
!for a half-penny, a penny, a three-penny bit, a sixpence and a
shilling—or as many other coins as you like. Let us suppose also
that both machines deliver bars of butterscotch of different weights
according to the coins inserted, and that we want to determine
j
experimentally whether the machines are similarly constructed or
not. We put our five coins into the first machine and receive, let
us say, packets containing respectively one, two, six, twelve and
twenty-four ounces of the commodity. We do the same with the
second machine and receive—somewhat to our surprise—two, six,
one, twelve and twenty-four ounces for the respective coins. We
conclude that the machines are to some extent similar (because the
two biggest coins produced the same results) and to some extent
iifferent (because the three smaller ones did not).
Now it is quite easy to calculate a measure of similarity from these
lata—one of the z's, in fact, that I have been tallying about—and
ilso the chance that this result is accidental—for example, that one
3f the machines is out of order. But we need not bother about the
196 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [parI
actual values in this rather fantastic case : What I want to emphai
size is that, unless one of the machines goes wrong, we can go on
repeating the test indefinitely without ever getting a different
measure of similarity—because the similarity is, as it were, built
into the machine. But we will, of course, get a constantly increasing
measure of confidence ; for the more often we get the same result
the less hkely it is to be due to some passing derangement and our P
the chance of accidental occurrence—is a measure of this likelihood.
Now, in machines there may be said to be no error ; but if there
were—as there is in obtaining reaction times from human subjects
—
or if we weighed our butterscotch inaccurately, we would get a
false measure of similarity ; but the longer we went on the more
closely would our estimate approximate to the true value and the
decreasing magnitude of P would be an indication of this.
It follows that, unless we are prepared to deny the propriety of
regarding a subject under test as a response-producing mechanism,
it is no use talking in an all-or-none sort of way (protopathically, as
the late Dr Rivers would have put it) about significant versus
insignificant similarities. We must recognise that these figures we
have calculated—these z's—are genuinely measures of the relation-
ships between the personalities, somewhat deformed by error, it is
true, but accurate and reliable to the extent indicated by the asso-
ciated chance. And in so far as they differ between themselves they
indicate corresponding differentiations within the psychological
manifold considered.
25
I do not know whether the reasoning in which I have just indulged
will have seemed convincing. If it has not, the reason, I venture to
believe, is to be found only in my imperfect exposition.
Fortunately, it does not particularly matter ; for I am in a
position to adduce further facts which I think will be found sub-
stantially conclusive.
I have already mentioned that the technique of Analysis of
Variance affords a test of difference as well as one of similarity.
When we apply this test to the Leonard reaction time data we
have :
2 P
LF - - No difference observable (z is - -0531)
LJ - - „ „ „ (0 is --1773)
LE - - „ „ „ (2 is --1088)
FJ - - -2266 -005 v.n., say 1 in 200
FE - - -2063 -01 „ „ 1 „ 96
JE - - No difference observable {z is - -1946)
136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 197
Taking tlie average diiferences in the way we did before we have :
' F - . . . . .1266
E - - - - - --0324
J - - - - - --0484
• L - - - - - --1131
It will be seen that this order for difference is precisely opposite
to that for similarity ; which is as it should be, if—as seems natural
—the most markedly similar personalities are the least markedly
different. The chance of this effect arising by accident is, of course,
1 in 24—a comforting, if not compulsive, reassurance that the
measures of similarity and of difference which we are studying are
not a " fortuitous concourse " of chance determined figures, but an
ordered assembly with, so to speak, a definite structure behind it.
The figures for reproduction test differences are somewhat curious :
for, although the differences shown are all feeble, they are all positive.
I do not know what the chance is of this occurring by accident among
six partially interdependent quantities of this kind ; but it is clearly,
I think, not more than 1 in 8, because we can choose (in several
different ways, as it happens) three ^dependent comparisons—such
as LF, LJ and LE—the probability of any one of which being positive
is one-half, on the assumption that chance alone is at work. Com-
bining this with the above-mentioned chance of 1 in 24 we get a
combined chance of about 1 in 160, which makes us feel pretty
certain that there is some method in this madness.
The actual figuies for the differences are :
2 P
LF - -0437 About -31
LJ - -0836 „ -23
LB - -1542 „ -045
FJ - -0712 „ -41
FE - -1504 „ -05
JE - -0390 „ -33
The average differences for personalities are :
E - - - - - -1145
L - - - - - -0938
F - - - - - -0851
J - - - - - -0646
and these show only a trilling correlation in the expected sense with
the corresponding figures for similarities. On the other hand,
among the similarities and differences themselves we observe no
fewer than three coincidences in rank (in the expected sense, of
course) and the chance of this happening by accident is 1 in 18.
Thus we see that from all sides small contributions conspire to
198 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part
give us a strong assurance that we are dealing with an ordered
system of differing relationships and not with a casual collocation
of artifacts arising from the fortuitous incidence of error.
26
The coercive evidence, however, is to be found in the reaction
time differences for FJ and FE. The chances of these being acci-
dental were about 1 in 200 and 1 in 100 respectively, and it will be
remembered that these comparisons gave also the smallest measures
of similarity. I have, of course, checked these by the " one or zero
"
method mentioned in section 6 above and obtained confirmatory
results. *°
Now these two comparisons are independent, in the sense that
there is no sort of reason, other than the existence of an inherent
structure such as we are interested in, why a difference between F
and J should involve one between F and E.
We may accordingly combine them by the usual rules and we then
have a combined chance of only about 1 in 19,000 of there being no
heterogeneity at all within the total mass of data.
It follows from this, to a very high order of probability, that the
Leonard Quartet, if I may so describe it, is 7wt—like Minkowski's
Space-Time
—" a homogeneous four-dimensional manifold " but
that there are highly significant heterogeneities within it.
This should dispose of any lingering objections that may still be
felt as to the propriety of treating the differences between similarities
as validly informative results, even if my ad hoc argument by
analogy with automatic machines has failed to carry conviction.
27
I must mention here that, in addition to the six quadruple
sittings just described, we carried out an entirely separate set of
experiments with the Leonard personalities, dictated by my early
fear that the reaction times were too long and too obscured by error
to give reliable results.
For this second set of experiments,*- I used a different and—if I
may put it so—a much " stronger " list of words, containing many
more of marked general interest, and this fact alone would prevent
us from expecting precisely parallel results. I also asked Mr
Drayton Thomas to do his best to speed up the reactions ; and this
he did effectively, for the mean time for all personalities dropped
from 4-5 to 3-1 seconds.** On the other hand, it proved possible to
use only fifty words instead of seventy-five and to obtain only four
instead of six sittings.
136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 199
The results obtained accordingly bear but little resemblance to
those from the main set of experiments,*^ and these results are of
low reliability, so that this work is mainly of interest in showing
that a total of only 200 observations from each subject is not likely
to afford a firm basis for future investigations.
None the less, one or two points of interest emerge, which seem
worth mentioning. For example, J and E still show the strongest
similarity, not only on the reproduction test as formerly but also
on the reaction times. J's dominance of the group asserts itself here
in respect of reaction times and not of reproductions, where he drops
to third place ; and F retains her position at the bottom of the
reaction-time list, thus tending to confirm the suspicion that there
is something aberrant about her when an element of word-selection
is involved.
28
I should like to suggest, at this point, somewhat parenthetically,
that it should be possible to extract yet more information from these
facts, and those yet to be given, by a process of systematic inter-
comparison. We might develop an argument, or series of argu-
ments, somewhat on the lines " If the similarity between A and B
is greater than that between B and C, and if the difference between
A and C is less than that between B and D, then . . . etc." Such a
procedure systematically applied would presumably disclose cer-
tain inconsistencies within the nexus of relationships considered
and it should be possible to decide what scheme of similarities and
differences calls for a minimum distortion of the figures given,
allowing for the fact that they are of differing reliability as indicated
by their associated P's (or the ratios of the to their standard
errors which determine these).
This appears to call for a mixture of logic and mathematics beyond
my present powers ; but I fancy it might prove a valuable line of
investigation.
29
The foregoing pretty well clinches, I think, the case for the
existence of marked and genuine diiferences between the com-
ponents of the Leonard group ; but I have yet to present what are,
perhaps, the most striking of all the results I have obtained. The
circumstances which led to them were as follows :
When I first began work on the analysis of the Leonard data I was
much perplexed to find so many resemblances as those I have
described. I had not then formulated the technique which later
i
enabled me to distinguish the personalities, and the contrast between
'
this considerable measure of similarity and the marked difference
observed between Garrett and Uvani was very puzzling.
200 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part
It was an almost casual, but none the less valuable, remark by
Mr Drayton Thomas that set me on what appears to be substantially
the right track. In one of his letters, he mentioned what he termed
Mrs Leonard's " personal preparation for a sitting " and suggested
that this might result in the reactions taken in what was supposed to
be her normal state being not, in fact truly normal.
I at once asked that a further six sets of Leonard reactions should
be collected in circumstances calculated, so far as possible, to ensure
a genuinely normal condition and, in particular, as far removed as
practicable from any of Mr Thomas' own sittings. Mr Drayton
Thomas most kindly concurred in this proposal and further enlisted
the services of two friends, Mr W. H. Wilson and the Rev. G. C.
Batten, to assist in the work. We are very much indebted to them
for their good offices in this matter, which could scarcely have been
managed in the time available without their help.*^
I shall speak of IVIrs Leonard thus tested as " Normal Leonard
"
—L(N) or Ln—and of Mrs Leonard previously tested in a supposedly
normal, but actually prepared, state as " Prepared Leonard "—
L(P) or Lp.
I had in mind, of course, the idea that the process of preparation
would presumably be intended to promote in advance of the sitting
some measure of preliminary rajjport with the expected communi-
cators and that, on any hypothesis, this might lead to reactions taken
in this state being coloured, as it were, by whatever influences are
at work during the sitting itself.
30
I accordingly examined first the reaction time relationship between
Normal Leonard and Prepared Leonard, and then those between
Normal Leonard, F, J and E as before, with the following interesting
results :
There is only the shghtest of similarities between the two Leo-
nards ; but equally there is no difference.
The figures are :
Similarity Difference
z -P z V
•1085 - - -18 --0253 -
—
The two states may be regarded as quite neutral, so to speak, with
respect to each other.**
On the other hand I found no similarity, but a very marked
difference between Normal Leonard and Feda, whereas there had
been a definitely significant similarity in the case of Prepared
Leonard.
136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 201
The comparative figures are :
Similarity Difference
z P z P
L(N) & F - - -0050 — -2834 -0008 v.n.
L(P) & F - -2740 -009 - -0531 —
This tremendous reversal of relationship cannot rationally be
attributed to chance. We conclude, therefore, that some highly
significant change is wrought in Mrs Leonard's psychical constitution
by the process of preparation referred to.
When we compare Normal Leonard with J, it is interesting to
note that there is still a considerable measure of similarity and only
an insignificant trace of difference, as compared with an overwhelm-
ing similarity and no difference at all in the case of Prepared Leonard.
The comparative figures are :

Z P 3 P
L(N) & J - -2546 -013 -0444 -32
L(P) & J - -3445 -002 v.n. - -1773 —
In the case of E we find a negligible similarity and an equally
negligible difference ; the two personalities are even more neutral to
each other than the two varieties of Leonard. Previously there had
been a very modest degree of similarity and no difference at all.

I shall discuss the possible significance of the other changes below.
We may now re-write our tables using Normal Leonard instead
of Prepared Leonard and obtaining :

F - -3119 -1679
E - -3269 -1170
J - -3329 -1061
It will be noticed that the two orders show a one to one (inverse)
correspondence in accordance with expectation.
Note how, with these data. Normal Leonard differs violently from
E and significantly from J.
After this there can be no excuse whatever for regarding the
Leonard manifold as homogeneous.
32
I will do my best to take a bold sweep and straighten out this
tangled tale in a few dogmatic words.
The four factors, L, F, J and E are clearly distinguishable, if not
by one test then by another.
Of these four factors J is dominant, particularly as regards the
trance itself and the prepared state of L. The influence of the J
factor extends even to normal Leonard states ; but this is not
136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 203
unreasonable on any hypothesis. Mediums are often described as
" sensitives " and it is certainly likely that they owe their gifts,
whatever the explanation of these may be, to a susceptibility which
more ordinary people do not share. It seems to me inevitable
that the mere fact of doing a test, even in her normal state, after
having done so many with Mr Drayton Thomas, would arouse in
Mrs Leonard's mind, or attract to it, whatever influences are operat-
ing in the Thomas sittings.
The E factor is closely linked with J, and it seems to me that the
resemblances noted between L and E, such as they are, arise more
because E is like J and J dominates L than because E and L resemble
each other. Note how E escapes from L as it were when J's influence
is weak, as in the reproduction test with Normal Leonard.
F seems to occupy a somewhat intermediate position. Her
allegiance appears to oscillate between L and J according to circum-
stances and her connection with E seems to follow her connection
with J. But the reaction times distinguish her very sharply from
Normal Leonard.
33
Unfortunately, I cannot very well end this paper without a few
words on the thorny subject of interpretation, even though I am
much more interested in illustrating a method than in drawing
conclusions from these applications of it.
Thus, although I am above all things anxious that we should
maintain a conservative policy and develop this kind of work on a
basis of reasoning from present knowledge rather than of guessing
from present ignorance, it would be mere cowardice if I did not
point out some of the difiiculties which would embarrass any
attempt to explain these facts in the light of current psychological
conceptions.
Let us see what we can make of it on orthodox lines.
We might start by saying that the work of Prince and Peterson
was on too small a scale to be very weighty, and we might go on by
saying that the condition under which Rudi appears to play the part
of Olga is not a trance at all. Both these points are debatable, but
we will not bother about that now.
This procedure enables us to suggest that the yielding of signi-
ficantly dissimilar reactions is a regular feature of multiple persona-
lity. I do not in the least know how we could reconcile such a
contention, and all that it implies, with the rest of our knowledge
of how subconscious content constantly influences behaviour. But
I doubt not that there would be found, let us say, here or there a
psychoanalyst hardy enough to undertake the task, for are not
some of these true sons of Habbakuk
—
capable de tout ?
204 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [pabt
But I think that even the hardiest and most successful expositor
might find himself in a quandary if he were then asked, " Well
then, by what criterion do you define individual minds as different ?
"
If he replies, " By the criterion of having different bodies," he begs
the whole question at issue and is ipsofacto unfitted for human inter-
course, while, if he says, " By the criterion of having differing sub-
conscious content," he will be reminded that this is just what he has
been attempting to explain away. I think his only chance would
be to maintain that—in the case of Mrs Garrett, for example—there
are " really," if we only knew it, duphcate brains and nervous
systems which are switched into and out of action by the process
of going into trance.
Personally, I consider this sort of thing to be fantastic to the
point of absurdity and calculated to arouse only the ribald laughter
of instructed persons ; but I suppose that as a most desperate pis
aller it might satisfy the prejudiced and the ignorant for a time.
But I cannot imagine what our supposed apologist would do when
he came to the Leonard material and found himself confronted with
this strange medley of personalities, resembling each other in some
respects, differing in others, in varying degrees and according to
circumstances—for all the world as if they were really four different
consciousnesses each interpenetrating the other to some extent.
Above all, he will find it awkward to explain how it comes about that
a personality which gives so perfect a rendering of a distinguished
Wesleyan Divine, contrives to dominate the scene and to be, as it
were, plus royaliste que le Roi—more normal than Normal Leonard
herself.
I fear he will be driven to the conclusion that I must have calcu-
lated the whole thing backwards like a cinema-film reversed.
34
On the other hand, for anyone who likes to be bold enough to
entertain the hypothesis that the personalities are what they purport
to be, the whole thing becomes simple enough. And it is simpler
still if we rid our minds of the antiquated notion that consciousnesses
are some sort of discrete entities which can be isolated in psychical
preserving jars and neatly labelled L and F and J and E.
Once our thought is freed from this kind of hmitation, it is easy
enough to imagine the temporary formation of a corporate or
composite personality or consciousness in which each member
affects the others though each is uppermost when in control of the
medium. On such lines as these, I find, everything falls readily
into place ; the dominance of J—a man of strong character in life ;
the affinity with E, his daughter and for many years his close
136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 205
companion ; the consistent least similarity of F to the others when
word-selection is involved ; the influence of the strong-minded and
interested J on the normal but always sensitive L ; and the negligible
effect of the less interested F in the same circumstances—all "fit
together into a coherent pattern as neatly as the pieces of a well made
puzzle.
35
None the less, although what I have just said seems to me scarcely
to be denied, I want to make it perfectly clear that nothing whatever
in the facts I have presented entitles anyone to claim—as some
enthusiasts are sure to do, however plainly I warn them—that this
work " proves human survival " or even " demonstrates the exist-
ence of discarnate entities." Let it be clearly understood that
it does neither the one nor the other, and any claim that it does
will constitute a grossly imwarrantable extrapolation from the
facts.
It is perfectly true that the facts are easier to explain if we make
certain tremendous assumptions of a spiritistic nature ; but this
does not constitute proof. It may be merely an indication of our
own psychological ignorance, just as at one time it was found easiest
to explain simple astronomical occurrences by supposing the sun
to be swallowed by a monster every night and regurgitated every
morning.
Discarnate consciousnesses may exist : I think that they do.
Human survival of death may be a fact in Nature : I think that it is.
It may even become strictly demonstrable : I believe that it will.
But however true these propositions may be, not one of them follows
from the facts I have described in this paper.
All that I claim that these facts show is, first, that the Word
Association test—properly applied and its data properly analysed
—
affords a most powerful instrument for the study of the problems
which confront us ;
and, second, that in order to cope with the facts
elicited we may well be obliged to revise somewhat extensively our
theories concerning multiple personality.
And I want to insist that, despite the difficulties I have indicated,
it is from this starting point of multiple personality—of which as
psychologists we know a good deal—and not from that of discarnate
entities—of which as psychologists we know nothing at all—that
the study of these phenomena must be developed,
j
When, if ever, we succeed in obtaining significantly similar
'
reactions from the same ostensible communicator through two
i
different mediums, we may begin to talk about discarnate entities,
I And when, if ever, we obtain from a supposed communicator,
through a medium, reactions significantly similar to those he gave
o
206 Whately Caringion, M.A., M.Sc. [part 136]
before his death, we may reasonably begin to talk about proving
survival.
In the meantime we must suffer ourselves to be guided by the
relentless Law of Parsimony, which bids us abhor superfluous
hypotheses ; but we may well take for our motto the words of
Terence :
Nil tarn difficile est quin quaerendo investigari possit.
" There is no limit to the powers of Research."
PEEPAEATORY NOTE TO APPENDICES
The objects of the following appendices are : First, to lighten the
text, which would otherwise be unreadable ;
Second, to afford
detailed support to the statements made therein ;
and. Third, to
provide such information as to the method of procedure and the
reasons for it as will enable others, if they so desire, to repeat the
experiments in a manner resembling the original work sufficiently
closely to afford valid confirmation of it (or the reverse) ; or at
least to enable usefully comparable results to be obtained.
If, as is only too possible where so much detail is involved, I have
failed in either of these last two objects, I shall be very pleased to
remedy the defect to the best of my ability, either by publication
or by correspondence ;
especially if—as I greatly hope may be the
case—others are moved to undertake parallel researches on these
lines.
Questions of interpretation will best be decided by doing more
work.

The Psychogalvanic Eeflex Apparatus
The apparatus used for observing the Psychogalvanic reflexes in
the Garrett-Uvani and Eudi-Olga investigations was built to
specification by Eesearch Engineers, Ltd., of Canonbury, who were
also responsible for the detail design.
The circuit used was the ordinary Wheatstone's bridge (too well
known to need illustration or description here), having one fixed
arm of 1,000 ohms, one arm variable in the usual way from 0 to
9,999 ohms by three dials, and the third providing alternatives of
1,000 or 100 ohms—the latter being used, of course, for external
resistances greater than 9,999 ohms and giving a range up to 99,990
ohms if desired.
The galvanometer was a Gambrell portable reflecting type (Type
No. 10716) using a 100 ohm coil and having a sensitivity of 5 mm. on
the scale per microampere. {N.B. These instruments are very
compact, being self-contained and fitted with a translucent scale
only some 6" or so from the mirror.)

208 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part
Since, in this class of work, we are negligibly interested in the
actual resistance of the subject, but only in the relative sizes of
changes of resistance, the bridge was built up of " commercial
"
grade resistance units, costing only a shilling or two apiece, instead
of using expensive precision resistances.
Dry batteries were fitted giving, by means of a two-way switch,
a nominal three or six volts across the bridge. The actual voltage
applied at any moment could be read by means of a simple volt-
meter mounted on the operating panel. This precaution is im-
portant.
These batteries also supplied the galvanometer lamp and an
additional small lamp for the use of the operator.
The electrode leads (of ordinary " flex ") were arranged to plug
into sockets in the side of the containing case.
The sensitivity control of the galvanometer consisted of a
1000 ohm resistance connected in parallel with it, one lead to the
galvanometer traversing this resistance ; thus sensitivity was a
maximum when the galvanometer was shunted by the whole 1000
ohms.
The sensitivity indications on the control dial were, accordingly,
correct in general only for the external resistance (4000 ohms) at
which the bridge was calibrated for sensitivity. The following
table shows the sensitivity factors for other external resistances.

These and similar factors were, of course, used in reducing the
deflexions observed to standard form. See Appendix III, 20.
The following table shows the approximate changes in external
resistance necessary to produce one mm. scale deflexion on the

The whole apparatus was built, for portability, into a case
measuring about 9" wide by 15" high by 10" deep. This was fitted
with a recessed and detachable door, or lid, in which the hand
electrodes, leads, etc., were housed, and by an ingenious arrangement
due to Messrs. Research Engineers this door could not be closed for
transport until the safety lever of the galvanometer was pushed over
—a procedure which also automatically switched off the galvano-
meter lamp.

Test Observations
1
The following notes are not a mathematical exposition of the subject,
for which Professor Fisher's Statistical Methods for Research Workers
and the original papers cited therein, should be consulted.
They are intended merely to show, in a purely empirical way, how
the method is applied in practice to the particular problems here
considered, so that anyone acquainted with simple arithmetic and
possessed of a calculating machine will be able to use it in this class
of work. I hope, however, that the elementary illustrations given
will serve to indicate, roughly at least, the " why and wherefore
"
of the processes involved.

Suppose that we are dealing with any pair of personalities, X and
Y, and that we have tested them Avith n words on n' occasions each.
In the illustrations which follow, I am supposing that n' is 5 and
n is some small number. In practice, 'ii' will often be 5 or 6, whereas
n will usually be 50, 75, 100, or some other relatively large number.
We will start by writing down the observations in tabular form
in the manner indicated below, keeping to letters for the moment
instead of actual figures, for the sake of generality.

It will be understood that the entries in any row have to do with
the same word, the entries in any (pair of) column(s), such as III
(and III') have to do with the same occasion, and the entries in any
" block " have to do with the same 'personality.
Now if there were no error whatever, of any kind—physical,
psychological or observational—and if all the words were of exactly
equal significance on every occasion to each subject, then all the
entries would have the same value. This is an absurd case, of
course, but will serve as a starting point.
Next, suppose that the two personalities differ in the sole respect
that one is, say. twice as " reactive " as the other ;
but that, again,
there is no kind of error and that the words have all the same equal
significance for both subjects. In this all the entries in either block
will be the same, but all those in one will be double those in the other.
This case does not particularly interest us and we will neglect it
here.
Now, suppose that there is still no error, and that the personalities
are identically similar ; but that the different words have a varying
significance {ex hypothesi, for both subjects alike). Then all the
entries in any one roiv will be the same, but those in any column will
vary. We might have the kind of thing illustrated in Table II,
where I show four words only in order to save trouble.

This is the idealised case of two identically similar personalities,
free from error, not varying from occasion to occasion, but varying
considerably in their reactions to different words. Notice that the
entries under T and T' (which are the totals of their respective rows)
vary a good deal, as do those under " Sum," which are obtained by
adding T to T' ; while those under " Difference," obtained by
subtracting T' from T for each row, are all zero. The first fact
indicates the varying effects of the different words, the second the
similarity (identity) of the two personaUties.
212 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part
If, on the other hand, the two personalities were somewhat
different (there being still no error and no variation from one
occasion to another) we should get something like Table III :
Table III

Notice here that the entries under " Difference " are not zero and
vary through a range of 20 units.
It should not now be very difficult to realise that the variation of
the entries under " sum " is a measure of the differing significance
of the words for the two personalities taken together ; while the
variation of the entries under " difference " is due partly to this
and partly to the extent to which the personalities differ with
respect to the different words. This last is the quantity in which we
are interested.
In order, therefore, to judge the extent to which the two per-
sonalities are similar we must compare the variation of the entries
under " Sum " with that of the entries under " Difference "
;
because, if the former is large compared with the latter, we shall
know that the differentness of the words, rather than that of the
personalities, is mainly responsible for whatever variation is found
in the " Difference " column.
Now, in statistical practice, for reasons which I shall not attempt
to explain, variations of this kind are always measured by taking
the sum of the squares of the quantities concerned from their mean
value (or some derivative of this, such as its value divided by the
number of quantities or the square root of this last—known as the
" standard error " or " standard deviation ").
The quickest way of calculating this quantity is to use the formula
S{x-x)^=Sx-{) -xS{x)
where S{x -x)^ stands for " the sum of the squares of the quantities
from their mean," S(x-) for " the sum of the squares of the quan-
tities " and xS{x) for " the sum of the quantities multiplied by their
mean." {N.B. Since x equals tlie sum of the quantities divided by
136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 213
their number, it follows that the quickest and most accurate way of
computing this quantity is to take the sum of the quantities, square
it, and divide by the number of quantities.)
This procedure is used for calculating all " sums of squares."
{N.B. The abbreviation " sum of squares " is habitually used for the
expanded expression " sum of squares of difference's from the
mean.")
In order, then, to compare two personalities for similarity, we
start by working the quantity S{x - x)^ first for the " Sum " column
and then for the " Difference " column.
In the infantile example given in Table III we have :
Sums Differences
S(x) - 580 S{x) - 0
S{x^) - 89,000 S(a;2) - 400
fS(.r) - 84,100 xS{x) - 0
S{x-x)'^ - 4,900 S{x-x)- - 400
In order to reduce these values to a " standard form," so to
speak, independent of the number of observations on which they
are based, we must divide each by the number of contributing
entries—^in this case 10, because there are 5 entries in each of the
two rows which go to build up any given Sum or Difference. In
general, we divide by 2n', where n' is the number of occasions
(sittings) involved.
Further, we must obtain a magnitude which is not at the
mercy of the number of words used. To get this we do not
divide by n, the number of words, but by n-1, because there are
only n-1 independent comparisons which can be made between
words.
The result of the fijst process is to give us the " sum of squares
"
for the entries considered, and of the second to give us the " Mean
Square."
Thus, by dividing by 10 in the above case, we obtain 490 and 40
for the " sums of squares " for the Sums and Differences respectively;
while a further division by 3 {N.B. There are only four words, so
that n - 1 is 3) gives us 163-3333 and 13-3333 respectively.
Now the first of these, as already indicated, depends on the
varying effect produced by the differing significance of the ivords,
and we may therefore speak of it as the Sum of Squares for Words,
denoting it by W, and the corresponding Mean Square by
MS.W. The second depends on the differential effect of words on
the personalities, so that we may call it the Sum of Squares for
Word-cum-Personality, denoting it by \'VT ; the Mean Square
will similarly be MS.WP.
214 Whately Garington, M.A., M.Sc. [part
The next step is to divide MS.W by MS.WP, which gives, in this
case 12-25.
For mathematical reasons given in Professor Fisher's book we
next look up the natural logarithm (the logarithm to base e) of this
and halve it. Thus :
Log, 12-25 2-5055
1 „ „ 1-25275
This quantity is known as z and is the measure of the similarity
between the two personalities.
But we now want to know how much it is worth, and inasmuch
as in this case it is based on only four words we shall not expect it
to be worth very much, although " as z's go," so to speak, it is a
high value.
Now it can be shown {loc. cit.) that the standard error of such a z is
equal to the square root of the reciprocal of the number of indepen-
dent comparisons (technically known as " degrees of freedom ")
which can be made between the quantities from which it is derived ;
that is to say, in this kind of case, between the numbers of words.
As there are only four words in this case the standard error will
be the square root of 1/3 which is -5774 very nearly.
We accordingly divide z by this standard error (commonly known
as Oz) and look up the value of P corresponding to it in a table
giving the deviation of the normal distribution ^ in terms of the
standard deviation [e.g., loc. cit., Table I).
In this case we have :
z/cr, =2-1695.
Reference to the table shows us that the corresponding value of
P is almost exactly -03. But this must be halved, because it only
represents the chance of getting a z of this magnitude by accident,
whereas we want to know the chance of getting one not only of this
magnitude but also of this sign ; for there is nothing in the mathe-
matics to prevent z being negative.
So we end up with
z = 1-25275, P = -015.
We may interpret this result as meaning that there is a strong
similarity between the two personalities, which is fairly—but not
overwhelmingly—reliable, for there are about 15 chances in 1000 of
its being accidental.
As an alternative to the last part of the procedure, we may use
Professor Fisher's Tables, which give the values of z, for various
numbers of degrees of freedom for the two Mean Squares concerned
at the two points P -05 and P -01. {N.B. It is a more or less arbitrary
^ N.B. z is normally distributed.
136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 215
convention that anything yielding a chance of -01 or less is considered
definitely significant, anything between -01 and -05 as semi-signi-
ficant, and anything greater than -05 as non-significant.)
In actual word-association test practice, of course, where the
numbers of degrees of freedom for W and WP are always equal , it
is quicker (and more accurate) not to work the mean squares but
to divide one 2w'W by 2n'WP straight away. In the example we
should divide 4,900 by 400 without reducing them to 163-3333 and
13-3333 first.
In practice, also, where 50, 75 or more words are used, the figures
are very much heavier. The following is an example from actual
work.
Case : L(P) and F. 75 words, 6 sittings.

To recapitulate : In order to test two personalities for similarity,
proceed as follows :
Write down the observations in rows and columns as shown in
the illustrative tables above. Add the entries in each row for each
personality, thus obtaining the " Personality Word Totals " given
under T and T'. Sum these by words for the two personalities,
obtaining the figures under " Sum." Subtract the right-hand word
total (say) from the left, writing down the (algebraic) difference
under " Difference ". Check all this by the ordinary methods of
summing columns, etc.
Work the sum of the squares of the differences from their mean
of the entries under " Sum ". Do the same for entries under
" Difference " (algebraic mean, of course).
Divide the result for Sums by that for Difi^erences (this is short-
circuiting the process of reducing to Mean Squares). Find the
natural logarithm of this quotient. Halve it. This gives z, the
measure of similarity you want.
Subtract one from the number of words used. Find the reciprocal
of the resulting number. Find the square root of this. Divide z by

216 Whately Camigton, M.A., M.Sc. [part
it. Look up the value of P in a table of normal deviates. Halve
this. The result is the chance that the observed similarity is
accidental.
The process of testing for difference is not so easy as the foregoing
test for similarity ; nor is it so easy to describe or explain.
We will start by saying, very colloquially, that " Error is the
extent to which the same things don't happen under (apparently)
the same conditions ", and will add that, if there is no error (as in
the idealised examples given above) any difference observed is
absolute and cannot be attributed to chance, accident or error at
all. because there is no error to which to attribute it.
In these examples, it will be noted, each personality is shown as
giving precisely the same reaction to a given word on every occasion.
In practice, this is far from being the case, however carefully we
try to ensure that experimental conditions are the same. The
result is that, instead of such figures as
19 19 19 19 19 and 17 17 17 17 17
for personalities X and Y respectively, we get something like
19 23 15 18 20 and 16 18 15 21 15
The point to notice here is that although each entry for X in the
fijst case differs from the corresponding entry for Y, this difference
is constant, namely 2 ; whereas in the second case the differences
vary being, in fact,
3 5 0 -3 5
In the first case, the constant difference is due to the fact that the
word has a different exciting power on the two personalities ; in
the second, the varying difference is due to the distortion of this
effect (if any) by error and whatever systematic difference of effect
may be produced on the personalities by the fact that the occasion,
as such, is different for the several pairs of observations.
It is, therefore, the magnitude of this variation in difference
between corresponding pairs of entries that interests us when we are
trying to determine whether the difference between personalities
(indicated by the magnitude of the Mean Square for WP calculated
above) is attributable to Error or not.
In principle, then, the first step of the procedure is to take the
corresponding pairs of entries for each word, subtract (algebraically)
the one from the other, as just shown, and calculate the sum of
squares of deviations from their mean of these differences. This
sum of squares must then be divided by 2, because two entries
contribute to each variate—just as in calculating W and WP we
divided by 2n' . Thus in the case just indicated, the (algebraic)
136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 217
mean of the differences obtained by subtraction is 2 and the sum of
the squares of their differences from it is 48, which divided by 2
gives 24. This is the contribution, so to speak, made by this word
to the total variation due to change of occasion and personality
together with error.
We must therefore repeat the process with each word, when, by
summing all these contributions we shall obtain the total variation
due to these causes.
In practice this is intolerably laborious and very liable to error ;
the following is the best procedure I have been able to devise.
Taking the analogue of Table III (in which, of course, the entries
for each word for either personality will, in general, vary), write
down the algebraic differences between corresponding pairs for the
various occasions by inspection as we did in the elementary example
just worked. We thus obtain figures such as these (taken from
actual work) :
Sitting
:
I II Ill IV V Total
Word
1 -92 -53 -9 -77 59 -172
2 26 -82 38 -41 -19 - 78
3 111 0 -65 -62 -41 - 57
4 -43 55 3 69 61 + 145
etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.
The totals on the right should agree with the corresponding
entries in the " Difference " column (see Table III) which were
used in computing WP, and this fact? affords a most valuable check
both on the subtractions by inspection here involved and the
original summing of the data for W and WP working.
When these figures have been written down for all words, find the
sum of the squares of the lot. This is best done by columns direct
on the machine, either using it to do the squaring for one (in the case
of heavy figures) or working by a mixture of tables and memory for
smaller figures.
From the sum of squares thus obtained subtract the value of
S{x'^) which was used in computing WP, divided by the number of
occasions [sittings) used {yi'). Divide the result by 2. Application
of elementary algebra will show that this gives precisely the same
answer as the formal ritual previously described where the sum
of squares of differences from the mean is computed for each
word separately. It is incomparably quicker and less liable to
mistakes.
We thus obtain a new S{x -x)- to the treatment of which we will
return after a short digression.
218 Whately Gariyigton, M.A., M.Sc. [part
As already indicated, the variations we have just been considering
inchide any systematic variations due to the differential effects of
occasion on personality. For example, a warmer day might
stimulate one personality with respect to all words and depress the
other. The variation thus introduced must be subtracted from the
quantity which we have just found before we can decide how much
of the latter consists of true Error of the kind that interests us.
The occasion-cum-personality contribution in question may be
denoted by OP and calculated as follows :
Sum the columns headed I, II, III, etc. (that is to say, the " occa-
sion columns ") for each personality and subtract the corresponding
totals one from another, just as we did for the corresponding pairs
of entries in the case of the individual words. Thus we might have :
X Y
Occasion: I II III IV V I II III IV V
Total: 257 129 365 238 164 264 132 368 246 180
and the differences between corresponding totals would be
-7 -3 -3 -8 -16.
Work the sum of the squares of the differences of these from their
mean, which here comes to 113-2. But to the formation of each
difference there contribute 2n entries, where n is the number
of words as before. Consequently we must divide by 2n in order
to get the proper value of OP. If, as was often the case in my work,
we are using 75 words, we divide by 150 and in this case we should
obtain for OP the fantastically low value of 113-2/150 or -7547.
This quantity, then, whatever it may be, represents the contribu-
tion made by occasion-cum-personality to the total discrepancies
between corresponding pairs of entries. We therefore subtract it
from the S{x-x) last calculated (from the differences of correspond-
ing pairs), thus obtaining a new quantity, called OWP (occasion-
cum-word-cum-personality) which is Error for our purpose.
But in order to obtain from this a quantity comparable with WP
(which, it will be remembered, is our index to the extent to which
the personalities differ) we must again divide by the appropriate
number of degrees of freedom so as to obtain a Mean Square for
OWP for comparison with MS.WP.
This number is given by {n-l){n' -1) where n and n', as pre-
viously, are the numbers of words and occasions respectively. Thus,
if there are 75 words and 6 sittings we divide by 370. This division
gives MS.OWP. We divide MS.WP by it, just as we divided (in the
strict procedure) MS.W by MS.WP, and derive a z and a P in
precisely the same manner as before.
136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 219
The following is an example from actual work :

z= -2266

z/(T,= 2-5188
Whence P is found to be -005, very nearly.
{Note. In these cases, where n is fairly large, cr^ may be taken as
n'
2{n-l){n'-iy
The foregoing, though highly imperfect from a mathematician's
point of view, will, I trust, be sufficient to enable the comparative
amateur to perform the actual calculations necessary to obtain
valid results from his observations, and to form some idea of what
he is doing and why.
One word of warning may be added. Unless it is actively
desired to qualify for the sweet security of a mad-house, it is futile
to attempt such computations on any considerable scale w^ithout
a suitable calculating machine.
I did about two-thirds or more of my own work on a hand-driven
machine and would never do so again. An electrically driven model
is virtually essential.
It is hopelessly slow and very error-liable to look up large squares
in tables and add them on the machine ; the big summings of
squares for W (and usually for WP also) should be done direct on the
machine, which must accordingly accumulate products—as practi-
cally all do. The machine should also " accumulate multipliers ",
so that at the end of such a summation of squares the sum of one
set of factors is available as a check against omissions. This, how-
ever, necessitates double dials (as in the Monroe KA 163 or MA. 3. 173)
because without them the individual squarings cannot be safely done.
Best of all is a machine such as the Rheinmetal SA. lie with full
automatic multiplication in addition to accumulation of multipliers.
This greatly reduces the strain on the operator and correspondingly
minimizes liability to error and necessity of repeated checking.

N.B. It would be almost miraculous if, in the single-handed computa-
tion of so formidable a mass of material, offering many thousands of
opportunities for error, no minor slips should remain undetected.
I have, however, applied the ordinary checks to all calculations and
special checks to those of critical importance ; and I am confident that,
although a complete and faultless re-working might possibly lead to
alterations in, say, the second or third place of decimals in some of the
values given, no substantial change in the results would be found
necessary. W. W. C.
1. This is not to say that no work has been done on the psycho-
logical characteristics of trance personalities ; Mrs Sidgwick's
monumental study of the psychology of Mrs Piper's Trance {Proc.
S.P.R., xxviii.) is an outstanding example, while the particular
observation that " Phinuit ", though claiming to be a French doctor,
had a negligible knowledge of either French or Medicine, belongs to
the same category. But no such work, that I know of, contains the
all-important quantitative element.
2. The proper word is clearly " psychometrical " ; but this has
unfortunately long been used to refer to a class of paragnostic
phenomena into which no metrical element enters. It is for con-
sideration whether it would not be well boldly to adopt the term for
the kind of method here discussed, which does consist in obtaining
metrical attributes of the " psyche ", and to find a more appropriate
term for the variety of paragnosis concerned.
3. Cf. Jung, Studies in Word Association, 1918.
4. "... subconscious or unconscious. ..." I use the words
interchangeably except that " unconscious " indicates a lesser
accessibility and a greater difficulty of exhumation. There is no
essential difference of kind, but only of degree, between conscious,
subconscious and unconscious ; the distinctions, though convenient,
are arbitrary ; there are no hard and fast water-tight compartments.
Or, if there are, it is futile to talk about their contents, because
—
by
definition—we can never tell what is in them.

7. "... apparent ..." An electromotive force may also be
generated, sucli as could be detected by a sufficiently sensitive
galvanometer without the aid of a Wheatstone's bridge or any
E.M.F. applied externally. This may reinforce or diminish the
effect of the resistance change proper, but we cannot tell this
by looking at the galvanometer. Hence the use of the word
" apparent ".
8. We may take the deflexions as being proportional to the
voltage on the bridge, for any given change of resistance, and correct
by dividing the deflexion observed by the quotient of the voltage
used by that at which the bridge was calibrated—in this case 3 volts.
The sensitivity correction depends on the actual construction of the
apparatus ; see Appendix I.
9. Actually the same kind of consideration does apply to some
extent to psychogalvanic reflexes.
This is not due, as might at first be supposed, to the deflexion
being an " unknown function " of the magnitude of psychical
disturbance in which we are interested ; for it does not seem
possible to define the extent of the disturbance except in terms of the
measurements we make on it—any more than we can define physical
objects in any terms other than those of the measurements which,
directly or indirectly, we make on them.
But introspection shows that the psychogalvanic reflex may be
misleadingly increased by a process best described as regeneration,
e.g. the subject may first be embarrassed (say) by the word and then
much more so by his own embarrassment. This latter effect may
be determined by local circumstances, such as the person of the
experimenter, and is not therefore necessarily a measure of the
intrinsic excitingness of the word.
Special research on the optimum " cut off point " for psycho-
galvanic reflexes is accordingly needed ; but fortunately no sig-
nificant difference dependent on them arises in the course of this
work.
10. The " median " is that value of the variate above and below
which values occur in equal numbers. It is identical with the mean
only in symmetrical distributions. Thus in the distribution
M, 11, 8, 12, 10, 9, 13, the value 11 is both mean and median ; while
for the series 4, 12, 11, 12, 14, 9, 13, 10, 6, the median is 11, but the
mean 10-101 . . . etc. The median is also known as the " probable
mean ".
11. Compare my Measurement of Emotion, p. 64, where I conclude
that disturbance in reproduction " is not only a complex-indicator,
. . . but the complex-indicator jjar excellence ".

12. " . . . preferences for different initial letters ... for the
response words ..."
In the case of Garrett and Uvani I counted the number of replies
beginning with A, B, C, etc., for each. I also counted the corre-
sponding frequencies for the first and last fifty words in each case.
The correlation between the frequencies for the whole of G with
the whole of U was -7309 ; and for G (1-50) with G (51-100) it was
•7158. But this high correlation between G and U is largely due
to the restrictions imposed by the numbers of words available
beginning with the different letters. I accordingly took the average
frequencies of these as indicated by three different dictionaries and
obtained correlations with these dictionary values of -6434 for
G (1-50), -7764 for G (51-100), -6807 for G and -8467 for U. Elimi-
nating the " dictionary effect " by the usual method of partial
correlation, I obtained a figure of -4482 for G (1-50) and G (51-100)
and one of -3955 for all G with all U. The former represents the
consistency of Garrett in this matter, apart from the influence of the
language, and the latter the agreement of G with U. Neither is
highly significant, while the difference between them is neghgibly
so. The test accordingly fails, but seems worthy of a mention on
grounds of general interest.
13. It seems convenient to interpolate here a note of warning
against a mistake to which some might be liable and a fallacy in
which many frequently indulge.
First : Any test which does, in fact, significantly distinguish
personalities, is ipso facto a valid test, and over-rides any number
which fail to do so. The test of counting legs, for example, would
seldom enable us to distinguish normal persons, though it might
work for senile millipedes ; and the same applies (with reservations)
to the teeth of young healthy persons, as also to fingers and toes.
But if these tests failed we should none the less accept the results
given by comparing Bertillon measurements, supposing these to
indicate difference.
Second : It is commonly but erroneously maintained that " no
number of negative results can outweigh one positive result." This
is not true. When I say that the chance of a phenomenon occurring
accidentally is p, this is equivalent to saying that ^/pure chance alone
is at work the phenomenon will occur, on the average, once in p
trials. And it may be that we have, to speak colloquially, struck
just that pth occasion at the first shot. Hence the importance of
knowing the value of p ;
for, if this is fairly large, such as -2 for
example, our assurance that we have not done so is correspondingly
slight.

(b) Half a dozen preliminary words, or thereabouts, taken from
an auxiliary list were given at the beginning of each test of each
personality, and before starting on this main list, in order to make
sure that everything was working properly and to give the subject
a chance of " settling down"'. If this precaution is omitted the
early words of the list are apt to give unduly large effects, notably
as regards psychogalvanic reflexes. The mere fact of being
tested renders the subject especially susceptible until he gets used
to it.
It was presumably a failure to realise this fact and to allow for it
that led Wechsler and Jones {cf. Psychological Bulletin, 1927,
pp. 173-4), using eight of the most exciting and eight of the least
exciting words taken from my own earlier results, to conclude
that position in the list was of great importance. As the starting
effect, so to speak, may well continue for just about six or eight
words, it is not surprising that working with a list of only 16
words, without preliminaries, they should have reached this con-
clusion.
224 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part
In these early experiments I used only five preliminary words
(c/. The Measurement of Emotion, p. 31, which. Wechsler and Jones
presumably have not read) ; but that these were enough for
my contemporary purpose is shown by the fact that if the order in
which the words were given is correlated with the order of mag-
nitude of the mean corrected deflexion for my whole 50 sub-
jects (which Wechsler and Jones clearly did not trouble to do),
we obtain a coefficient of only - -08, which shows that order
had, on the whole, an utterly insignificant effect on the results
obtained.
The value of the criticism may be estimated from the following
flat contradiction (Psy. Bull., loc. cit.) :
" The difi^erence between earlier and later position is much
greater in the case of emotionally toned (critical) than in the non-
emotionally toned (non-critical) words. For example, when the
word '
table '
occurs at the head of the list, the deflexion it elicits
is on the average eight times that when placed at the end ; but the
word '
kiss '
has a deflexion only 20 per cent, greater when placed
at the beginning than when placed at the end." (My italics.
W. W. C.)
Or can it be that American kisses are even less exciting than
American tables ?
(c) The dates of the sittings were: 24. vii., .31. vii., 14. viii.,
21. viii., 28. viii. and 2. ix., 1933.
15. In order to localise, so far as possible, the effect of any
breakdowns in the trance or the experimental technique, the words
were handled in blocks of 25 as above and the changes of order were
made within the block. Six orders determined by a simple plan
were used. No personality received the words in the same order
twice ; but each received them in each of the orders once. The
same order was not used twice at a double sitting.
The object of this varying of the order was primarily to prevent
subjects getting warning from one word of which was coming next,
but also to minimise the effects of " perseveration " where the effect
produced by one word " carries over " to the word or words
following.
16. I conducted, however, a short ad hoc study of these negative
deflexions in connection with a point which arose in preparing my
review (q.v.) of Mr Hereward Carrington's work on this medium.
I should like to emphasise here that the occurrence of these numerous
negative deflexions is no kind of reflection on Mrs Garrett's bona
fides.

18. The following table shows the coefficients of correlation
actually obtained by the various procedures.
The columns headed GG- and UU show the coefficients resulting
from working the means of odd-numbered with even-numbered sit-
tings for Garrett and Uvani respectively, and are thus measures of
their self-consistency. Those headed GU give the results of working
the means for all Garrett sittings against all Uvani sittings and there-
fore give a measure of their agreement with each other.

{N.B. It will be noticed that although the consistencies of the two
personalities fluctuate violently we never get anything approaching
a noteworthy agreement between them.)
19. To test the difference between any two of the above co-
efficients for significance w^e may proceed as follows [cf. Fisher,
Statistical Methods for Research Workers, p. 182).
Convert the coefficients into the quantities called " z "s by the
formula
2 = i{log,(l+r)-log,(l-r)}
where r is the coefficient of correlation concerned and e the base of
natural logarithms, as usual. Find the standard error of each z by
takmg the reciprocal of three less than the number of pairs of
136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 227
variates concerned. Subtract the lesser from the greater z and
find the standard error of this difference by summing the two
reciprocals just obtained and taking the square root of this sum.
Divide the difference of the z's by this and look up the chance of
getting such a result by accident in a suitable table, e.g. loc. cit.,
Table I.
Example : Take GG and GU for the second entry in the left hand
half of Table II above.
Applying the above formula we get
r z n - 3 Reciprocal
GG 4198 44735 76 -01316
GU --0279 --02785 92 -01087
Difference -47520 Sum -02403
Sq. Root -155
Diff Sq. Root 3-065
Whence the chance of this being accidental is found to be less
than one in a hundred though greater than one in a thousand. We
should take this to be significant and conclude that G and U are
" different " were it not for the very low self-consistency of Uvani,
i.e. the low value of the coefficient for UU.
When we take the mean value of the z's derived from GG and UU
as a measure of the total self-consistency, so to speak, and a corre-
sponding value for the standard error of this, we obtain a probability
of accidental occurrence of just about 1 in fifty. It needs a certain
amount of optimism to regard this as significant.
The figures obtained by the method of ranks gives much better
results, namely a chance of no more than about 1 in 600. But
the method of ranks is itself somewhat discredited and the pro-
cess of " stepping up " from the value p first calculated to the cor-
responding r involves assumptions which may not be warranted
here.
Consequently, though I have little personal doubt that the result
is genuine, I do not care to claim it as such.
20. Correction of Garrett-Uvani Psychogalvanic reflex data :
The data actually entered on the working sheets were the scale
readings of the galvanometer at the beginning and end of each
deflexion, together with the relevant balancing resistance, sensitivity
adjustment and the voltage actually applied to the bridge.
The first step in reducing these data to the form required was the
construction of a tripartite Reduction Factor, consisting of (a) the
sensitivity factor, (6) the voltage factor and (c) the resistance
factor.
The first of these was obtained from a table (see Appendix I)
giving the true change in sensitivity at any setting of the sensitivity
228 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part
control for a given external resistance. The second was the quotient
of the voltage at which the bridge was calibrated (3-0 v.) by that
actually in use. The third was derived from calibration curves
showing the change in resistance necessary to produce a deflexion
of 100 scale divisions, at full sensitivity and with three volts on the
bridge, for any given external resistance.
The next step was to multiply each of the two scale readings just
mentioned by this composite Reduction Factor, thus obtaining the
amounts (in ohms) by which the external resistance had changed,
from the value to which the bridge was balanced, at the beginning
and end respectively of the reaction.
The difference between these quantities is evidently the actual
ohms change constituting the reaction.
The resistance to which the bridge was balanced, less the first of
the two ohmic changes just mentioned, is the true external resistance
at the beginning of the reaction, and I expressed, in all cases, the
actual-ohms-change calculated as a percentage of this " initial
resistance " ; for I argued that a change of, say, 10 ohms in 10,000
could not reasonably be regarded as equivalent to one of 10 ohms in
5,000 or 20,000.
The percentages thus obtained were further corrected for the
possible effects of fatigue, or like secular changes within the period
of the sitting, as follows :
Assuming the change to be linear in time, I grouped the per-
centages, for each sitting, by tens of words (1 to 10, 11 to 20, 21 to 30,
etc.) and calculated (by the usual method of least squares) the
equation to the straight line most nearly passing the points whose
coordinates were the means of these groups of percentages and the
numbers 5-5, 15-5, 25-5, etc.^
From this equation I derived a new factor for each percentage
change, such that, dividing by it, I turned each into a percentage of
the mean (percentage) change for the sitting concerned.
These were the figures used in the correlations.
It appears, however, in the light of further study, that much of
this very laborious technique is redundant, although I think it the
nearest practicable approach to a truly rigid treatment.
In the first place, the use of the " resistance factor " (c) mentioned
above is largely nullified by the subsequent expression of the actual
ohms change as a percentage of the " initial resistance " ; for the
first process consists in multiplying by a quantity which, for high
resistances at any rate, is very nearly a linear function of the initial
resistance, and the second consists of dividing by the initial resistance
itself ; so that the relative values of the figures ultimately obtained
^N.B. This saves much labour, but introduces a small error, negligible in
all ordinary cases.
136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 229
for the various words (in which alone we are interested in this
work) are little altered from those of the deflexions corrected for
voltage and sensitivity only.
Secondly, the use of the " initial resistance " instead of the
" balanced resistance " is a minor refinement which could be
omitted without serious results.
Thirdly and most importantly, in comparing two personalities,
it is clear that whatever error is allowed to reniain by omitting
these correctional procedures applies to both ; so that the final error
affecting the results is no more than differential.
Given reasonably good raw material, I should only use this very
elaborate technique in cases where (a) the issue was of the first
importance and (6) the less elaborate treatment yielded ambiguous
results ; or (c) where it was desired to obtain the nicest quantitative
information possible.
The same applies to the correction for fatigue, etc., which seems
seldom if ever necessary. Its desirability in any particular case can
be judged by inspection or by some simple test such as that indicated
in Note 29 below.
21. The reason is as follows : Despite what I said above (Note 9)
about the impossibility of defining the disturbance in which we are
interested except in terms of the measurements we make, it seems
none the less true that it is absurd to allow a whole set of reactions
to be dominated by one or two " freak " words. Frog, for example,
in the case of Garrett, gave a change of 1,084% (10-84 times) the
mean change on one occasion and 1,018% on another, while Dog
in the case of Uvani went as high as 1,178%. The method of ranlis,
whatever its limitations, does at least obviate absurdities of this
kind ; and I think it worthy of consideration for very erratic
material although, of course, it wastes whatever niceties of gradation
there may be. The point, however, has no importance for the
results described in this paper.
22. See note above. I am inclined to think that these two words
have a genuine significance for the two personalities respectively,
but that the effects produced by them have been greatly exaggerated.
This may be due to the regenerative effect mentioned in Note 9,
but also—I am inclined to suspect—to the personalities half-
wittingly " playing up " to what they knew was expected of them.
{N.B. The word Frog occurred in Mr Hereward Carrington's list
and the marked effect received comment.) It is not so easy as
it sounds to be a good test subject and so to adjust one's mind
that each word comes freshly and without reference to previous
tests.

25. Given the number of disturbances in reproduction for the two
personalities at a given sitting, it is easy to work out the expectation
of coincidences between these if chance alone is at work. The
number of actual coincidences is counted and compared with the
expectation. The chance that the difference between the expected
and observed number is fortuitous is calculated by the usual method.
{Cf. Fisher, loc. cit., p. 80 et seq.)
The same procedure can be apphed to two successive sittings of
the same personality. As a result of five such tests of each kind
I get a mean value for [cf- ^oc. cit.) of 0-355 for comparisons of
G with U and the chance of this being accidental is between -5
and -7. For comparisons of G with G, and U with U, at different
sittings, I get a mean value of 11-613 with a corresponding chance of
about -0005 (by extrapolation from the table given). This result,
supporting that obtained by analysis of the 26 unbroken words,
appears to justify the statement that the chance of the difference
between G and U being accidental is probably much less than
1 in 100.
26. This figure (though of no real interest
—
vide supra, p. 187) is
justifiable even if the contention of Note 25 is refuted, because the
most conservative reasonable estimate from the reaction times is
less than 1 in 1,000,000, and Note 24 shows a chance of 1 in 120,
while the reflexes are certainly good for one of 1 in 10.

This list also was given in differing orders on different occa-

It will be noticed that by misadventure the word kochen appears
twice. This does not affect the results obtained, since one of the
sets of reactions obtained was spoiled by gaps, so that the word
appears only once in the block of 56 unspoiled words on which the
conclusions are based.
A total of 47 words (marked *) are exactly or closely paralleled
in my list as used for Garrett-Uvani and the Leonard group (first
series).

29. Partly for the reasons given at the end of Note 20 above and
partly because the material was so much better, I did not apply to
these data the elaborate ritual of correction which I used in the case
of Garrett-Uvani. Each deflexion was multiplied only by the
sensitivity factor and the voltage factor, thus giving what it would
have been at full sensitivity and w^ith three volts on the bridge.
As an indicative test of the adequacy of this procedure I worked
the figures given in Table V above for the Rudi material for the first
sitting. {N.B. The first ten words give an abnormally high mean
due to insufficient preliminary words having been given, but this .
136] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 235
does not affect the issue here. It was partly for this reason and
partly because Olga broke down after only 25 words that the sitting
was discarded.)
The words were grouped by tens from the list and the means,
allowing for gaps, were computed for each group («) correcting for
sensitivity and voltage only, as above (6) using actual ohms change,
and (c) taking the fully corrected data as for Garrett-Uvani.
If the different methods of treatment made no difference at all,
the ratios interlineated in the table would be identical in any one
row. The fact that they differ very slightly shows that the more
elaborate treatment makes little difference as compared with the
less.
{N.B. It will save repetition if I mention here that a somewhat
analogous test was applied before computation to all reaction time
data. These tests did not disclose any appreciable systematic
tendency towards change of time with the progress of the experi-
ment.)

(N.B. The difference, if any, would show up here rather than in the

32. Lest any trace of difference should by chance escape notice, I
also applied to the fragmentary data for the 44 words, left after
taking the unbroken block of 56 for analysis, the same correlational
procedure that I had used for the Garrett-Uvani psychogalvanic
reflexes. The coefficients obtained were :

This residual material is, accordingly, entirely uninformative.

N.B. No reproductions were obtained from J or E at the second
sitting. See text, § 20.
It is convenient, if not strictly relevant, to note here that there is
considerable doubt whether Feda reacted properly in the first
sitting. Apparently she often thought of a reply before hearing the
stimulus word. Notice the relatively very short reaction time for
this sitting and compare with the remarks on this subject in connex-
ion with Rudi Schneider. Text, § 16.
The effect, of course, is merely to dilute the useful material with
a certain amount which is useless and does not affect the validity
of the results obtained, except by making them less marked.
Suitable admonishment, together with practice, led to a normal
performance by Feda in this respect.
39. We need not trouble about the P's corresponding to small
negative z's. A big negative z would indicate that the two per-
sonahties were " contravariant " ; that is to say that there was a
strong tendency for one to give a small reaction whenever the other
gave a large one, and vice versa. This would indicate a causal
comiexion between the two, just as a significantly large negative
correlation would do ; but it would, I think, be quite unintelhgible
psychologically.

240 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part 136]
twenty weeks, while tlie first series itself extended over twelve weeks
We can, therefore, hardly attribute the change to lapse of time ; ioi
if Mrs Leonard remains substantially the same during twelve weeks
(and if she did not we could scarcely obtain significant results from
the first series of experiments) she is not likely to change radically
in the next seven or so.

Note the considerable speeding up of Leonard's reactions, even
as compared with the Second Series figures (Note 37). This may
be partly due to systematic differences in the modus operandi of the
timers, but such differences provided they are constant for the
individual operator make no difference to the computed results
while if they are not they only increase error without altering the
sense of the results.

Hereward Carrixgton, An Instrumental Test of the Independence
of a " Spirit Control ". (American Psychical Institute :
Bulletin I : pp. 96. Price ^2.00. New York : 20 West
58th Street.)
The Bulletin in which this paper appears is the first issued by the
recently formed American Psychical Institute, of which jMr Here-
ward Carrington is Director, and we may feel confident that if the
spirit of objective enquiry which has inspired the work reported is
maintained, the Institute will make many notable contributions to
psychical research in the future.
In addition to the strictly instrumental tests, the Bulletin contains
a few pages dealing with the formation of the Institute, accounts of
a variety of collateral experiments of various kinds, and discussions
Df the results. I shall, however, confine myself almost exclusively
to the quantitative work with the psychogalvanic reflex and reaction
times, considering this to a great extent in the light of my own recent
studies in the same field, which are described elsewhere in this
issue.
Inasmuch as I was the first to suggest the method used (as Mr
Carrington handsomely acknowledges) the task of reviewing this
first attempt to apply it places me in a peculiarly invidious position.
For if I praise (and much praise is merited) I shall be suspect of
vrishing to exalt my own offspring ; while if I criticise (and many
3riticisms leap to the instructed eye) I shall be thought envious of
Mr Carrington for being before me in applying my suggestion. And
the worst of it is that both accusations will be true ! Between this
Scylla of jealousy and Charybdis of opportunism I must steer as best
I can, but the difiiculties are doubled by the fact that although Mr
Carrington has given, in effect, what appears to be the right answer,
it is the easiest thing in the world to drive the proverbial coach and
four through the procedure whereby he arrived at it. And it is
aecessary to point out the joints in the methodological harness lest
prospective workers in this field should be misled, or the uncritical
induced to mistake a valuable reconnaissance for a sweeping
victory.
In briefest outhne, what Mr Hereward Carrington did was this :
tie applied a word association test to the well-known medium, Mrs
Eileen Garrett, and to her " Control " known as " Uvani " (purport-
ing to function through her body, of course) on various occasions ;
241
I
242 Review [paet
the measured reflexes and times corresponding to the words usedj fl
in the test were then compared by correlation, and the conclusion »
was drawn that those from Mrs Garrett and Uvani respectively
"°
showed much less agreement than those from Mrs Garrett on
different groups of occasions. From this conclusion Mr Carrington,
very reasonably, felt himself entitled to infer that the two per-
sonalities do not share a common subconscious mental content and
should therefore be regarded as " different " individuals. This
argument is perfectly sound ;
because, without begging the whole! uf
question at issue, there seems to be no other way of defining what
"™
we mean by " same " or " different " in this context. But the
validity of the inference, like that of any other argument, depends
on that of the data to which it is applied, so that, if these are
unreliable, the inference is equally so.
Now, the conclusion that the Garrett and Uvani deflexions (oi
times) differ significantly, which is the starting point of Mr Carring-
ton's argument, is itself the end product of a complex process ir
which three sciences, namely psychology, physics (in the case oi
psychogalvanic reflex) and mathematics play a part. These thre(
aspects will be considered seriatim below.
But Mr Hereward Carrington, although he has spent many years
in the active pursuit of psychical research, is not and does not profess
to be a trained psychologist, physicist or mathematician. H(
therefore had recourse (in principle very wisely) to those who did
Unfortunately, with one or two honourable exceptions, these co-
adjutors did not serve him well, but omitted almost every pre-
caution and committed almost every error that could find place ir
the work.
To account for this fall from grace we may charitably invoke th(
theory of the Enchanted Boundary—so trenchantly developec
by Dr Franklin Prince ^
—which separates psychical research fron
other sciences and is such that so soon as the sceptical ''
scientist
'
crosses it
" his weapons become like rotten wood, the joints of hii
armour begin to gape widely, and his proud steed alters to a sorrj
jade, stumbling at every pebble in the way ". Otherwise we shoulc
be compelled to infer a degree of levity and incompetence which r
would be distressing to associate with Transatlantic science.
I will now discuss various specific points which have occurred t(
me in the course of reading the Bulletin : .
- • .
•
Psychological.
(1) To anyone accustomed to using the word-association test
Mr Carrington's psychological advisers brand themselves witl
amateurishness by permitting the use of the infinitive forms " t<
1 Cf. Psyche, iii. 298, and his book of that name.
136] Review 243
sing ", " to die ", etc.,. instead of simply " sing ", " die ", etc.
The use of these forms is, in principle, objectionable because the
essence of the test is that it should be conducted crisply, so that the
subject receives in a clear-cut manner the unheralded impact of the
stimulus word. Imagine—to take the extreme case—an experi-
menter saying, " Now I wonder whether you would be so kind as to
give me the pleasure of hearing your reaction to the interesting
little word '
pusillanimously '
^
" This is ridiculous, of course, but
any premonitory irrelevance is apt to take the edge off the word
given.
But the reason why these forms were used is simple. Most of the
original work on the word-association test was done in German,
notably by Jung and his co-workers and in their lists we naturally
find the infinitives " singew ", " sterhen ", etc. When such lists
are translated into English, the translator rightly indicates that an
,
infinitive was used ; but no man familiar with either the theory or
practice of the test would dream of using such infinitives in English
working.
I am well aware that these forms are given in the supposedly
authoritative work of a well-known American psychoanalyst ; but
: this merely shows that he inserted the matter concerned more " for
the sake of completeness " than because he knew anything about
the subject.
I do not say that the use of these forms made the slightest differ-
ence to the result : I do not for a moment suppose they did. But
I do say that their use indicates that Mr Carrington's psychological
advisers were unfamiliar with the practice and ignorant of the
theory of the word-association test.
(2) Conformably with this conclusion, I find no indication that
the order of the words was varied as between one experiment and
another (c/. supra, p. 224, note 15). This precaution is desirable
because every word should be presented to the subject so far as
possible de novo, whereas, if the order be not altered, some words
will soon give warning of those that follow them and the effect of
1 these latter will be altered.
(3) No account seems to have been taken of the possible effect
of fatigue in producing spurious resemblances or differences, by
prolonging unnaturally the reaction times towards the end of a
sitting or increasing or diminishing reflexes. These effects seem to
be negligible, but the possibility should have been noted, if only to
be dismissed. To allow it to go by default, so to speak, suggests

to reflexes, thougli here the oversight is more pardonable, for onl
an intimate personal experience with the method would lead on
to realise how the effect can come about here.^
(5) When correlational methods are to be used, faute de mieux, it
is important that allowance should be made for the fact that the
psychological or physiological " mood " of the subject may vary
from one occasion to another ; for otherwise a sitting conspicuous
for very long times or very large deflexions may dominate the
others and distort the result. This may best be done by expressing
each time or deflexion as a percentage of the mean for the sitting to
which it belongs. But this was not done, leaving room for un-
necessary error, though inspection does not suggest that this was
serious.
These last three points are admittedly semi-mathematical,
inasmuch as some notion of how figures are compared is needed for
their apprehension. But it is the business of the psychologist to
supply his statistical colleague with figures from which systematic
errors have been eliminated, or to collaborate with him in their
removal ; and every competent experimental psychologist possesses
(or should possess) at least a smattering of statistical theory, which
seems to have been lacking here.
In this connection I may point out that the figure of minus -4 given
for the coefficient of correlation between G and U for the first series
of experiments conducted in 1932 (p. 32) indicates just as close a
relationship between them, though inverted, as would plus -4 ;
either figure is highly significant when 100 pairs are concerned. I
am told that this is a misprint for - -04, but it has strangely escaped
the notice of the enthusiastic " critics " who have hailed the work
as conclusive.
Physical.
Reverting to the experiments themselves the following points
are noticeable in connection with the psychogalvanic reflex tech-
nique.
(1) No circuit diagram or equivalent account of the electrical
arrangements is given, nor can I find any details regarding sensitivity
of galvanometer, average resistance of the subject, average change
of resistance per stimulus, etc.
(2) So far as I can ascertain by personal enquiry, the ordinary
Wheatstone's bridge method was used in the second series of tests
(1933) and the Godefroy transformer technique in the first. Now
the latter procedure, while possessing the advantage of an invariable
zero point for the galvanometer, does not give a measure of the
. .
1 Supra, p. 221, note 9. , . . A.: -
136] Review 245
resistance change in the skin but of the first differential of this with
respect to time. One might fairly say that the " bridge " method
measures the effect produced by the stimulus and the " transformer
"
method the rapidity of its onset. It was rash to assume that
these two are even qualitatively—much less quantitatively—equi-
valent.
(3) No allowance is made for, nor any relevant data given con-
cerning, the possibly great effect on deflexions of changes in the
subject's resistance during the experiment apart from the transient
effects of the stimuli {supra, p. 228). This, again, is a point which
(it would seem) may, in fact, be legitimately ignored. But in pioneer
work of this kind, where technique is not yet standardised, every
such point should be considered and the reasons (if any) for ignoring
it should be given. Otherwise, the suspicion that it has merely not
been thought of, with the corollary that the work is superficial, is
almost irresistible.
(4) Much more serious than any of these is the failure to under-
stand what is involved in the production of " negative deflexions
"
{supra, p. 179) indicating an increase as opposed to the normal
decrease of resistance on stimulation. These (as I think that every-
one who has worked at all extensively with the reflex will ao-ree)
are almost invariably due to mechanical movement between^ the
hand and the electrodes. {N.B. It is theoretically possible that they
might be generated by a back e.m.f. induced by the stimulus ; if so,
reversal of the electrode leads would abolish them.) As such, they
may indicate the kind of psychic disturbance which it is desired to
measure ;
but this needs demonstration before they can be used as
indicators with safety. Using my own material (Garrett-Uvani)
I obtained a positive correlation of -17 for Garrett and of -28 for
Uvani between the positive and negative correlations observed
(neglecting the sign of the latter). This is about what one would
expect ;
but it means that, in general, to treat negative deflexions
as if they were positive is to dilute informative material with much
less informative and thus obscure the answer.
Yet this was done, I understand, in computing the results of the
1932 experiments—and that without (presumably) such feeble
justification as I have just given.
(5) No account seems to have been taken of day-to-day variation
of resistance. See Psychological (5) above.
Statistical.
(1) Mr Carrington would have done better to have sought the
advice of a competent statistician, if possible, before planning his
experiments. He would then have been told that to base a research
of this kind on no more than two sets of readings from one of the
246 Review [part
personalities (Uvani) is asking for trouble. It is true that to liave
arranged for more Uvani sittings would have necessitated abandon-
ing others of considerable intrinsic interest. Possibly Mr Carrington
was wise in adopting the policy he did—on the whole, I think he was
—but it should have been made clear to him that this policy was
almost certain to preclude the obtaining of statistically significant
results.
(2) The plan adopted for comparing individual words (p. 33) is
antiquated and tells us nothing reliable when it has been applied ;
for who shall estimate the chance of the medians of pairs of variates
differing significantly from those of octets eleven times in a hundred 1
Moreover, although it may still be " customary to consider differ-
ences as large as four times their probable error ... as significant ",
this is a matter of pious homage to tradition rather than modern
statistical practice.^ The proper way of treating such problems is
by using the sums of squares of their deviations from their means
as described by Professor Fisher.^
(3) The use of the Spearman-Brown formula (p. 34, lines 9 and 36,
lines 1 and 2) is at least equally archaic. When first devised it often
served a useful purpose (though not wholly reliably) in enabling one
to pass, as we should now say, from an inter-clsiss to an intm-class
correlation. It would be better, now that we know how to do it,
to calculate an intra-class correlation straight away.^
(4) Mutatis mutandis, the above criticisms apply to the reaction
time data.
(5) It would have been better to compare the odd-numbered
Garrett sittings with the even-numbered, rather than the first four
with the last four, in order to compensate for any systematic change
with time in Mrs Garrett's reactions to the words.
(6) On the all-important question of the significance of the differ-
ence in the correlation coeffi^cients for G compared with U, as against
G with G and U with U, the method adopted is not satisfactory.
The proper procedure is to convert the coefficients into " z's " by
the formula z=i(log^ (1 +r) -log^ (1 -r), take the mean of the z's
for the GG and UU correlations, subtract that for the GU correlation
and divide the difference by its standard error, which is the square
root of the sum of the reciprocals of the number of pairs of variates
respectively concerned less three.
This procedure gives a value of 1-88, in the case of the reaction
times (see top of page 36) corresponding to a chance of accidental
occurrence of about 1 in 16. This cannot be judged significant,
apart from the reservations made under the heading Psychological
^

2 Loc. cit., 114-115. 3 chap. vii.
136] Review 247
above and from the fact that the two correlations are of very unequal
value.
^
The corresponding result from the reflex data is, as will be seen
by inspection, quite insignificant.
Thus it will be seen that from the total experiments emerges but
one promising result and that of very dubious significance—dubious
in the sense that unless it were confirmed (as I am happy to say that
it amply is by my later work ^) no statistician would accept it as
convincing, though actually it happens to be the right answer.
For this comparative failure Mr Carrington himself is in no sense
responsible ; for there can be no doubt that the care he expended
on the work would have led to results as convincing as my own if he
had not been misdirected on so many points.
He may well feel inclined to echo Mr Chesterton's lines :
" The New World's wisest did surround
Me, and I'm sorry to record
-:; I did not find their views profound,
. . .. Or their conclusions well assured."
For the credit of American Science it is to be hoped that more
effective help for him will be forthcoming next time he undertakes
experiments on these lines. And the sooner the better ;
for, in my
partial judgment at least, we need an immense amount of such work
at the present stage of the science.
I am not quite clear whether Mr Carrington supposes that a
marked difference in the mean reaction time or deflexion indicates
a difl^erence of personality of the kind he is seeking. On p. 38 he
rightly discounts the value of this and insists on the paramount
importance of the differential reaction as between individual words ;
but in his footnote to p. 34 and his textual note on p. 36 he appears
to take it seriously, for otherwise his disagreement with the '"
fair-
ness " of Dr Zubin's comparisons lacks motive. Actually, difference
in the values of the means is of no importance, for such an overall
change could easily be brought about by drugs, by fatigue, or even
^ The immediately preceding comments were made on the assunijJtion that
the correlation coeificients given are correct ; but they do not appear to be so.
Making allowance for the fact that the figures given in the published sheet
for the 193.3 sittings awkwardly show .], .2 . . . etc., where one fifth, two fifths
. . . etc., are intended, I obtain for the UU correlation the value .3283 instead
of .4565, for the 59 pairs of variates available. This is derived from the use
of the full Bravais-Pearson Product Moment Formula. Dr Zubin seems to
have worked with a Correlation Table, grouping all values greater than
6.0 sees, together in the 6 sec. class. This may account for the discrepancy
and the procedure seems to counteract the misleading effects of " too long
"
times. But, again, it should have been mentioned and justified.

by a heavy meal. Atropine, for example, properly applied,
abolished the psychogalvanic reflex, while a large lunch would, I
thinJv, appreciably slow the reaction time. These are all-round
physiological changes having nothing to do with psychical individua-
lity, and if anyone likes to maintain that they are " really " psycho-
logical, he will have to prove it first and find that it makes no
difference afterwards. At best, a change of mean time or of mean
reflex would indicate a change from, say, an excitable to a sluggish
type and this seems just the kind of thing—no more than an exagge-
rated change of mood—which a true secondary personality could
compass.
The test of individuality depends on the transvaluation, so to
speak, of associations revealed by the differential response to words.
Turning to the brighter aspects of the paper, there can be no doubt
that what Mr Carringtou has lost on the swings of significance he
has gained on the roundabouts of variety.
Particularly interesting, for example, are some of the personality
tests (Bernreuter, Page, Thurstone, etc.) applied by Miss Frances
Strakosch, and the Rorschach test given by Dr Levy. Some of
these (attitude towards the Church, attitude towards Birth Control)
may not be worth very much, but the general method ought to prove
extremely fruitful in this field and is very well worth develop-
ment.
Most of all I like, in idea though not in its particular application,
the test on what might be called " interference of learning " carried
out by Miss Strakosch and Dr Shipley. Briefly : Mrs Garrett and
Uvani were caused to learn lists of paired numbers in such a way that,
if there were any connection between the personalities, the learning
by one might be expected to facilitate learning by the other in one
set of circumstances and to retard in another. Indications of such
an interconnection were found ; but this is exactly the kind of test,
as Mr Hereward Carrington points out, which would show it on
any hypothesis, for any kind of learning by verbal repetition is
bound to establish nerve paths of lowered resistance in Mrs Garrett's
body, which is involved in each case. Such learning leads to an
automatism, so to speak, in which the higher centres or " pure
mind "—if this means anything—are not involved, as anyone can
testify who has learned a poem well enough to recite it while reading
a newspaper understandingly, or to work a calculating machine
while thinking of something else.
But the general plan of applying " mental tests " is excellent
and should be followed up. The right kind of test will not be easy
to select ; but from the hundreds available it should be possible to
choose a dozen or so which would enable quantitative methods to be
apphed to the comparison of the results.
136] Review 249
Another very striking part of the work is to be found in the highly
identificatory repHes sometimes given by " third entities " (supposed
communicating controls other than Uvani) of whom several were
tested. For example, the associations " Glass—Alaska " and
" Needle—Niagara " given by " Will " are superficially extremely
far-fetched, but apparently quite relevant to the supposed com-
municator. Our own experience with Mrs Leonard and her controls
suggests strongly that this method of " free association " is likely
to prove a far quicker way of eliciting evidential reminiscences
(especially if the subject is not required to answer against time) than
direct questioning or urging the communicator to think of something
evidential. This line of research should also be further developed.
To sum up : Taking the paper as a whole, Mr Hereward Carrington
is to be congratulated not only on his courage and enterprise in
undertaking so formidable a research under so heavy a handicap in
respect of material resources, and on his determination to import
the essential element of quantitative measurement into the cloudy
waste of psychical speculation, but on ha\ang produced a very
notable contribution to the subject—perhaps the most important
single contribution ever made.
But will scientists in other fields please note, for their future
guidance, that nothing short of a little better than their best is good
enough for psychical research ?

Introduction
The history of Rudi Schneider's mediumship up to the end of 1931
is given, in a summary form, in Proceedings, xl. 428-436. In the
following year the only sittings of any importance were those
organised in London by Mr H. Price in February-May ^ and by
Lord Charles Hope in October-December.^ The main points
emerging from these two series are : (1) An accusation of fraud on
a single occasion by Mr Price, an accusation which is open to
criticism and has been dealt with elsewhere *; and (2) the apparent
confirmation in Lord Charles Hope's sittings, though to a lesser ex-
tent, of the infra-red absorptions described by Osty.
^ An informal report of this research was given at a Private Meeting of the
Society on 30 May, and a preliminary account appeared in Nature (1934),

252 Report of an Investigation into [part
The Council of the Society regarded Dr Osty's reports ^ as pre-
senting a strong prima facie case for the infra-red phenomena
described by him. As the resources of the Instilut Metapsychique
had been strained by the earlier investigations, the Council made a
grant and an offer of collaboration to the Institut, which was
accepted. One of us (Th. B.) accordingly proceeded to Paris and
took part in seventeen sittings at the Institut during February-
March 1933. These were totally negative (except for a very slight
curtain movement during an informal sitting at a moment when
Th. B. was not present). Rudi accordingly returned to his home at
Braunau, where Th. B. followed him in the hope that the atmosphere
of the medium's home might be conducive to the production of para-
normal phenomena. The four sittings at which he was present there
were negative, except for two very slight curtain movements under
conditions making a judgment impossible.
At this stage it was arranged that the medium should have a long
rest before attempting to give further formal sittings, and that, after
an interval, a party of members of the Society should go out to
Weyer, in Upper Austria, where the medium now lives since his
marriage with Fraulein Mitzi Mangl. Miss Reutiner, Lord Charles
Hope, Mr Evelyn, Captain Cochrane-Baillie and Th. B. accordingly
went to Weyer in September 1933 and took part in several sittings
(Th. B. in three). Seemingly paranormal phenomena, in the form
of considerable telekineses and curtain movements, were observed,
but under non-evidential conditions. As a consequence Rudi was
invited to the S.P.R. He gave a series of sittings in the Society's
s^ance-ioom. between October 1933 and March 1934 inclusive.
The sittings were organised with a fourfold objective in view.
(1) To look for confirmation of the infra-red phenomena previously
reported, (2) to test the alleged telekinetic powers of the medium,
(3) to record any phenomena observed instrumentally, excluding
human testimony so far as possible, and (4) to make the conditions
of the sittings such as to inspire confidence in any results that might
be obtained.
In the event no phenomena clearly of a paranormal kiiad were
obtained. Nevertheless sufficient experimental details will be given
to enable the reader to judge of the methods employed.
The Seance-room
The Society's smnce-room was specially built for the purpose of
mediumistic investigations. It is supported on pillars, the space
below being used as a storeroom. On its south and east side the

double bolted on the inside during sittings, leading to a small ante-
room, which in turn leads to the main part of the house.
The space C (see plan, Fig. 1) is divided from the cabinet by a solid
partition, reaching from floor to ceiling. It contained a shelf, later
two shelves, stretching from wall to partition, on which stood a
254 Report of an Investigation into [part
Moll galvanometer, with its lamp and scale, a cardiograph embody-
ing an Einthoven string galvanometer, a voltmeter and a switch-
board. This apparatus was observed by 0. G., who had to crawl
under the lower shelf in order to get to and from his chair. The
apparatus enclosure was for all practical purposes light-tight.
The Cabinet
The larger enclosure formed the so-called cabinet, into which the
mediumistic " force " is said to enter, there concentrating itself and
issuing through the opening to produce phenomena. This cabinet
contained, at the request of OJga, the medium's control, a bowl of
water (on one occasion of ice), a lead box, and other things detailed
below. The history of this box is as follows. In sitting No. 20 Olga
alleged that the force was harmed by counter-vibrations. An in-
verted tin box was therefore introduced as a temporary measure, and
it was proposed to Olga that a permanent box impervious to all
radiation i
should be made into which the " force " could enter and
collect itself. Olga agreed with enthusiasm, and accordingly a box
was made (at the expense of one of the sitters, who wishes to remain
anonymous) of 2-inch chemical lead. The overall dimensions are
12" X 12" X 15". At the side nearest to the medium is a circular hole
of diameter 3", into which the force could enter, and on the side
facing the cabinet curtains was an oval of size 6" x 9", through which
the force was to issue. The justification for using this box is clear, for
Olgas statement, though improbable, might have been true. If, on
the other hand, Olga's notion about harmful radiations were purely
subjective, then the suggestive effect of accepting it and taking
appropriate steps could presumably only be beneficial to the pro-
duction of paranormal phenomena.
Curtain Movements
A phenomenon alleged to occur in sittings with Rudi Schneider is
the movement of the curtains forming the cabinet. These curtains
usually bear vertical strips of luminous ribbon, and in the present
sittings there were placed, in addition, luminous spots in four places
near the bottom edges of the curtains. Thus if a decided movement
occurred it was unmistakable, particularly as a record was always
dictated as to the spots visible to each sitter. Smaller movements,
however, would necessarily be uncertain, owing to the optical and
psychological difiiculties of accurately perceiving and locaUsmg
small luminous areas in the dark. Moreover, it was obviously desir-

cosmic rays, at all points of its surface other than the holes left as an entrance
and exit for the force.
137] The Medmmship of Rudi Schneider 255
able that the exact extent of such curtain movements, together with
the amount of energy exerted to produce them, should be measured.
A simple method of achieving this was accordingly devised. A strip
of leather was wound on a roller operating on an adjustable ratchet,
the roller being fixed against the wall forming the back of the cabinet,
and the farther end of the strip to the curtain. Hence a movement
of the curtain towards the sitters (the usual direction), at the point
where it was attached to the dynamometer, would force the attached
strip to turn the roller, which w'ould then remain in the position of
furthest extension, thus enabling the distance pulled to be measured.
The force exerted could be tested with an ordinary spring balance.
Actually the most sensitive adjustment of the ratchet enabled a
force of about 3 oz. to be measured.

No movement was ever recorded by this appliance and it was
accordingly dropped in favour of another and still simpler device of
a nature likely, if successful, to be more stimulating psychologically
to the medium. Nevertheless no response was obtained, and finally,
shortly before the end of the sittings, a still more sensitive arrange-
ment was installed. From the ceiling of a cardboard box measuring
8" X 8" X 18", were suspended a strip of brass and a strip of tinfoil 13^"
in effective length, and separated at the top by an insulating block
of ebonite, |" in thickness (see Fig. 2). The two strips were placed
in a bell circuit in such a way that if they were brought into contact
a bell was rung. On the tinfoil side of the box containing this
arrangement there was made an oval hole, which was connected by
means of a light tube to the oval hole of the lead box, into which,
after being lagged with cotton wool, it exactly fitted. Thus, the
" force " on leaving the lead box would be obliged to enter the con-
256 Report of an Investigation into [part
tact box and could hardly help exerting pressure on the tinfoil and
thus ringing the bell, for the tinfoil was so sensitively hung that the
slightest puff brought it into contact with the metal. At the same
time even vigorous blowing at the entrance of the lead box could not
affect the tinfoil. Under these conditions no response was obtained,
although the bottom of the curtain continued to move slightly.^
These circumstances do not completely dispose of all the curtain
movements, some of which seemed to extend to as much as 25 cms.
The need for further investigation of these movements was con-
stantly in mind, but it could not be done in a conclusive manner
without interfering with the more important tasks in hand. The
investigation of these movements was therefore limited to the
methods described, which at least make it probable that all the
curtain movements were due to stray draughts which were from
time to time stronger than usual. This can hardly be said to be
proved, but six or more people talking and singing in a room, com-
bined with an entry of cold air tlirough a grid, may be capable of
producing considerable effects now and again d uring a period of some
200 hours.
Cine Camera, Lighting, etc.
On occasion the cabinet also contained other things which will be
described below in connection with the temperature and mitogenetic
tests.
In front of the cabinet stood the box containing the thermopile,
etc., details of which will be given below in the section devoted to the
infra-red investigation.
On the thermopile box stood an inverted waste-paper basket,
under the edge of which was caught the corner of a handkerchief
nhich hung down the side of the box nearest to the cabinet curtains.
On the basket stood a small luminous hand-bell. Other objects on
the box were, at various times, a small celluloid ball, a black ruler,
and a partly luminous xylophone. These things were intended to
be the objects of the medium's telekinetic forces. In the hope of
photographing these objects in paranormal movement a cinemato-
graphic camera was installed with a film sensitive to the infra-red,
supplied by Messrs Ilford, and it was eventually found possible to
obtain sharply defined moving pictures in a feeble red light. By in-
creasing the infra-red flood lighting, and using horn or ebonite filters,
it is confidently expected that cinema films could be taken in total
1 The siini^le expedient of excluding the draughts could not be adopted, for
this would have made the room uninhabitable during the long sittings. The
source of the draughts is a small ventilation grating in the ceiling, through
which fresh air is pumped into the room through a conduit, by a motor-
driven fan in the ante-room. It is certainly a pity that a more convenient
system of ventilation was not adopted when the seance-room was built.
137] The Mediumship of Rudi Schneider 257
absence of visible light. By this meaus motion pictures could be
obtained of telekinetic phenomena in a light that is innocuous to the
medium. No telekineses of the obj ects provided for the purpose were,
however, obtained, and consequently the camera was not used during
the actual sittings.
Over the table hung a lamp, the position of which was adjustable
vertically and laterally. This lamp was specially designed and made
for these sittings. It consists of a hood of black-painted metal 12>\"
long, with a diameter of 12", inside which hung eight small electric
lamps, each in its own compartment and controlled by its own switch,
and each supplied with a red filter of different thickness. In this
way it was possible to obtain a large range of intensities of red light
and to know what amount of light was in use at any given moment,
for any change was at once recorded. The lamp as a whole was also
controlled by a rheostat, but the use of this was avoided.
The Control of the Medium
The method of controlling the medium is simple and effective.
He is seated in position H (Fig. 1), facing in the direction of the
arrow. Directly in front of him sits the first controller, who takes
the medium's hands in his own and puts his knees and the lower
part of his legs firmly against and outside the medium's. Moreover,
frequently tliroughout the sitting Olga requests the sitters to " hold
tight ", that is, to make sure that the circle is completely formed.
This request has the natural consequence of making the sitters, in-
cluding the controllers, hand-conscious, and thus serves to prevent
any lack of continuity in the control of the medium. Next to the
first controller sits the second controller, who is nearly always a
woman. She places her right hand round the medium's right wrist,
thus supplementing the first controller's guard of that side of the
medium nearest to the apparatus.
A detailed account of the method of control and of the precautions
taken to preclude fraud is on record, but in view of the negative
results it does not seem necessary to give this account in full. It
should be stated that luminous strips ^ were sewn to the sleeves of
the medium's pyjamas, which were provided by the Society.
General Arrangements
There was no notetaker in the seance-TOom. The records were
dictated by Th. B. into a telephone suspended round his neck, to the
secretary, who was seated in the Society's office, some distance from
the seance-room. In this way a complete record (extending in all to
some 400 typewritten pages) was made of all conversation with Olga

(except occasional trivial remarks), all observations made in the
room (the instrumental ones being called out by 0. G-.). Needless to
say, the task of the secretary, Mrs C. Wright, was an arduous one, and
we take this opportunity of expressing our cordial thanks to her for
the efficient way in which she carried out her work. Occasionally,
when the sitting was particularly long, the secretary left a little
before the end, and the last few minutes were taken down by the
medium's wife, Mitzi Schneider. Throughout every sitting held in
the seance-TOom, Frau Schneider was in the Society's office with Mrs
Wright or at the telephone in the manner described.
Such were the personal precautions taken to prevent fraud on the
part of the medium (apart, of course, from the direct precautions
taken to prevent interference with the apparatus). . These precau-
tions were all of a simple kind, which were not in the least trouble-
some to the medium, who, indeed, welcomed them. Naturally, if
paranormal phenomena had been forthcoming these precautions
would have been tightened up and elaborated ; as described they
were merely a first step.
When the sitters had taken their seats and the controllers had
taken charge of the medium, which was always done, at the begin-
ning of each sitting, in a bright white light, the light was extinguished,
generally by means of a rheostat placed in the observation corner.
The required amount of red light had already been switched on and
then remained. After an interval of about fom- to seven minutes,
the medium's hands and arms usually begin to tremble, this being
regarded, for purposes of record, as the beginning of the trance.
These tremblings fairly rapidly increase in strength until they are
interrupted by several violent clonic spasms ;
usually the medium
suddenly falls quite limp for a moment or two during these prelimin-
ary efforts. Then, after one of the clonic spasms, the medium relaxes
a little, though persisting in a moderately violent, jerky movement of
his trunk, and begins to change the rate and depth of his respiration.
Until this moment his breathing is more or less normal, allowing for
his violent movements. Now, however, the medium half opens his
mouth, and begins to breathe rapidly, noisily and wetly. This goes
on, interrupted by frequent clonic spasms, moments during which
the medium falls quite limp and does not breathe at all, brief com-
mands and jerky fragmentary conversation, until Olcja asks for an
interval. The process of coming out of trance is an almost exact in-
version of that of falling into trance. These processes are gone
through at the beginning and end of each part of the sitting.
The Trance and Respiration
The object of the present research as a whole was primarily to in-
vestigate the problem whether Rudi Schneider possesses paranormal
137] The Mediumship of Rucli Schneider 259
powers, and, if so, to iiiquii'e into the nature and capacities of those
powers. Other problems arising incidentally, however interesting in
themselves, had to be subordinated to this primary aim, at any rate
so long as the main question remained open. Consequently no steps
could be taken to study the psychological aspects of the medium's
I trance which might have adversely affected the subject's mediumis-
tic activities. Hence we restricted deliberate experiments on these
lines to word-association and psychogalvanic reflex sittings, the
results of which must now be set out.
As we have seen, when Rudi goes into trance his personality
changes. A strictly objective account of the change would be : when
in trance Rudi behaves as if he were a woman answering to the name
of Olga, who declares herself to be the surviving spirit of Lola
Montez.
Before we turn to the consideration, so far as our fragmentary
material permits, of the nature of Olga, a few words ought to be said
about the trance itself. On this subject we have little of value to
offer. We are unable to offer definite evidence as to the genuineness
of the trance, for the not inadequate reason that no conclusive
I
methods of determining this point exist. The method, quite in-
i
adequate moreover, of testing the subject's anaesthesia, could not be
tried without greatly endangering the object of the sittings. So far
as it goes evidence of this kind incidentally obtained tends to suggest
that the trance is genuine. During the violent movements in which
the subject indulges in his trance he frequently administered toler-
ably severe blows on various parts of his anatomy, without ever
giving much sign that he was even conscious of pain. But as the
subject in his normal state (as when playing football), has been seen
to experience without complaint even harder blows, this evidence is
not particularly convincing.
There remains the problem of the subject's abnormal breathing
when in trance. Tliis breathing is an invariable concomitant of the
trance, and has the appearance of beginning quite suddenly at a
rate of about 60 to 100 cycles per minute. Our impression is, how-
ever, that this sudden beginning is an illusion due to the noisiness of
the breathing when it reaches this point. What actually happens
appears to be this : the subject settles down and puts himself into a
favourable attitude ^ of body and mind ; after about four to seven
minutes, tremors begin in his extremities ; at the same time the
rate of breathing slowly increases with the increasing violence of his
muscular movements ; at a given moment the rate of breathing
becomes too great to be conveniently carried out by normal means ;
and at this moment the subject opens his mouth and begins the noisy
breathing so characteristic of his trance.
^ What this is is not known, as the medium is unable to say.
260 Report of an Investigation into [part
From this point the rate of respiration increases and varies up to a
maximum of 240 cycles per minute in the present sittings, though
higher rates have been recorded elsewhere. The question therefore
arises whether this breathing is in itself an indication of the genuine-
ness of the trance, on the ground that it is impossible to breathe nor-
mally at this rate without losing consciousness. This statement, at
least, can be answered definitely in the negative.
Dr C. G. Douglas kindly assisted in the collecting of samples of the
medium's breath in Douglas bags and their subsequent analysis.
Four samples of expired air were collected as follows :
Case I. 15-5°C. and barometer at 751 mm. The medium sitting
resting in light and out of trance. This was three-quarters of
an hour before Case II.
Case II. 15°C. and 756 mm. Collected 2 minutes 52 seconds after
the beginning of the panting.
Case III. 15°C. and 756 mm. 7 mins. 23 sees, after beginning of
panting.
Case IV. 15°C. and 756 mm. 13 miiis. 30 sees, after beginning of
panting.
In Cases II-IV inclusive the room was dark and the medium was
in trance.
Case II shows slight over-breathing. Case III shows a moderately
large rate of oxygen consumption if the time 0'46" instead of 1'46"
is correct. This figure corresponds to a man walking at some 4 miles
per hour, and since the medium was in fairly violent motion at the
time this high figure is in no way excessive.

Case IV is normal for ordinary mild exercise as far as the respira-
tory coeflficient is concerned and the breathing is definitely shallow.
No measurements were ever secured while the " force " was doing
work because it never was observed to do work. The above figures
suggest that the medium's breathing is one that gets shallower as the
137] The Mediumshij) of Rudi Schneider 261
rate of respiration increases. During a sitting short periods of apnoea
are observed, but these do not alternate regularly with, the breathing
and so there is no Cheyne-Stokes breathing. Moreover, the medium
shows no signs of distress at the end of a sitting.
A still more conclusive proof of the normal natm-e of the subject's
breathing in trance is the fact that we have both succeeded in pro-,
ducing exactly similar elfects during similar periods of time.
The figures for the total quantity of air breathed may be slightly
too small since there may be some leakage of the valves at the more
rapid rates of respiration recorded. This error, however, would not
aifect the composition of the exlialed gases. Even a 50% leakage
through the valves would still leave the figm^es at perfectly normal
values, so it must be concluded that there is notliing paranormal
about the respiration of the medium in trance.
This is a convenient point at which to insert a medical report

Finally, the trance cannot be compared with any known form of
e.g. hypnosis, since there are no hard and fast categories of hypnotic
states, whatever the early workers in this field may have supposed.
Even if there were, any useful comparison would be impossible,
since (a) the trance never takes place otherwise than in approximate
darkness, thus making visual inspection impossible, and (6) since the
clonic movements of the subject and his noisy breathing mask other
less obtrusive features that may be characteristic of the trance.
Rudi and Olga
There remains one possible indication as to the genuineness or
otherwise of the trance, which leads us directly to the consideration
262 Report of an Investigation into [part
of the personalities themselves. This is the question of memory : are
the memories of Kudi and Olga co-extensive ? Obviously a definite
answer is impossible, since, as Mrs Salter has well said in a somewhat
similar context, " It is very much easier to discover that a man does
not know a language when he is pretending he does, than to discover
that he does know it when he is pretending he does not." ^ kt the
same time we believe that Eudi's amnesia in regard to Olga is com-
plete. This belief is based on Rudi's behaviour when in his normal
state, in which he never gives the shghtest indication of any direct
knowledge of what goes on when he is in trance. This being so we are
also incUned to believe that the subject's trance represents a genuine
loss of normal consciousness ; but we are neither able nor do we
wish to put this any higher than a mere belief, though it is admittedly
a strong one.
We do not, however, feel confident of Olgas amnesia in regard to
Rudi's experiences. Olga herself, to say nothing of Rudi, behaves as
if there were no " correspondence " between them. This is mani-
festly illogical, for if Olga is a spirit who knows what is going on in
the physical world, as she claims, why should she not be aware of, at
least, the subject's physical activities 1 The same difficulty applies
to Olga's alleged ignorance of Rudi's mental activity, since she fre-
quently claims to know what others are thinking of. Nor is evidence
wanting that Olga does in fact know of Rudi's doings and thoughts.
Thus, to take only one example, Olga sent messages to Rudi not to
be unhappy at the death of his father. Again, it is frequently notice-
able that Olga insists on asking for special sittings when these will
interfere with arrangements already made by Rudi ; this is less direct
evidence, but none the less convincing.^ In short, we have little
doubt that there is no amnesia by Olga regarding Rudi.
This kind of one-sided amnesia is by no means uncommon, and it
unfortunately solves no problem. For Rudi's amnesia may be, and
very probably is, no more than the expression of a belief. If Rudi
believes that he cannot or ought not to remember Olga's experiences,
this belief is quite sufficient to account for the fact that in effect he
does not remember them. This naive causality of the mental life
increases by a hundred-fold the difficulty of most of the tasks of
psychical research.
We then arrive at the heart of our present problem, the true nature
of Olga. If Rudi loses consciousness on going into trance and if he
does not afterwards remember what he did in trance, then clearly
Olga and Rudi cannot be regarded as the same personality unless we
give a quite unjustified extension to our terms. There are thus two
1 Mrs W. H. Salter, " The History of George VaHantine," Proc. 8.P.R. (1932),
xl. 404.
2 This kind of antagonism is fairly characteristic of dual personalities.
137] The MecUumsM]) of Rudi Schneider 263
main possibilities : (1) that Olga is, as she claims to be, the spirit of
Lola Montez ; (2) that she is a more or less discrete part of the total
Rudi personality.
(1) The first of these possibilities it is difficult not to dismiss out of
hand. The full spiritualistic theory of the survival of the " whole
"
personality is certainly not acceptable, for Olga clearly does not
behave in a manner characteristic of Lola Montez. Thus, to take
only one minor example, she does not speak English although the
Montez did so. Even if we hold a minimum theory of survival, e.g.
the persistence of a small number of characteristic memories, it would
be hardly possible to accept Olga as Lola Montez, for she never in our
presence gave the slightest indication of the possession of any such
memory.
(2) Thus we can only inquire whether Olga is different from Rudi,
or at any rate more different than a mere secondary personality can
be expected to be. This point, obviously, can only be settled by the
inspection of various kinds of behaviour, and this we have done by
applying the word-association and the psychogalvanic reflex tests to
each personality separately and by comparing the results.
The psychogalvanic reflex portion of this experiment has already
been reported on by Mr Carington {Proc. S.P.R., xlii.), who shows
that Rudi and Olga are similar to such a degree that they must be
regarded as being the " same ". As Mr Carington also points out, it
seems that Rudi did not frankly co-operate in regard to the word-
associations. There is evidence to show that he systematically pre-
pared responses instead of uttering the first word that came into his
head. This strongly suggests that he was afraid that free responses
might betray something he wanted to keep to himself. A clue to the
nature of this " something " is possibly to be found in the stimulus-
response Schwindel-schon (Fraud-good) which occurred about half-
way through the first session ; too much weight miist not, however,
be placed on a single response of this kind, nor should it be forgotten
that this response may have been motivated by an old and super-
seded state of mind. At any rate, after this point there is practically
nothing in the nature of a genuine response. It is with regret that
we are obliged to draw attention to this fact, for it is impossible to
praise too highly Rudi's straightforward behaviour throughout the
ordinary sittings and his willingness to submit to every suggested test.
In these circumstances the word-association test is almost useless
for our present purpose, and there only remains one feature of the
Olga responses to be discussed. In the ordinary sittings Olga does
not speak much ;
indeed, the medium's rapid breathing makes nor-
mal conversation impossible. Her remarks are limited to instruc-
tions regarding the conduct of the sittings, and the vocabulary used
for this purpose is naturally limited. Now from the word-association
264 Report of an Investigation into [part
sessions with. Olga the curious fact emerged that Olga's vocabulary
seems to be wholly limited to the words used by her in the ordinary sit-
tings (her responses, like Rudi's, had no relevance to the stimuli). The
extent of her vocabulary is only a little more than half the normal.^
From the presence of such frequent repetitions of particular
responses as 14 (Acht, Achtung), 25 (alle), 18 (Freund, etc.), 14
(Licht), 11 (lustig), 19 (nicht), 15 (schliessen), 25 (sprechen), 13
(Strahlen), 15 (zahlen), and from the large number (70) of words
occurring only once, it may reasonably be inferred that there is no
consistency or definiteness in the word-responses. For such con-
sistency would produce results showing a few words occurring only
once or twice, very few, if any, occurring as often as those enumer-
ated above, and a large number occurring between three and six
times. Analysis of the lists confirms this inference, for the fact
emerges that there is no correlation between given stimuli and given
responses. This must necessarily be the case for the words that occur
most frequently ; but the following table shows that it is equally true
of the few words occurring between three and six times.

It is thus clear that the limited vocabulary produced by Olga in her
responses is not due to her possession of a consistent personality, that
is, one frequently giving the same or similar responses to given
stimuli. The responses to only two of the above words, indeed,
Himmel and Kreis, show any signs of consistency. Berg and Gebirge
(the use of these synonyms was due to an oversight in the compilation
^ A complete table of the words used by Olga in her responses is on record at
the Society's rooms.
137] The Mednimship of Rudi Schneider 265
I
of the lists), elicited the following responses in addition to Himniel
:
hell, frei, laut, besser, Hohe. It is thus a reasonable inference that
the notion of mountains produces a pleasurable reaction in Olga.
Kochen, which three times elicited Kreis, was also duplicated by
accident in drawing up the lists, and produced the following re-
sponses : zergangen, Abteilung, bewegen, bisjen sprechen, ja,
Freund. Hence the recurrence of Kreis may be simply due to the
fact that kochen was presented twelve times instead of six. If there
is any significance it is possibly due to a mishearing of Kreis as Eeis
(rice), a favourite dish of the medium's.
Berg-Gebirge, then, being the only stimulus-word which elicited a
characteristic response from Olga, it is interesting to compare the
results obtained with Rudi. These were as follows : Garten, Kopf,
bewegen, weinen, halt, Himmel, grausam, fein, Glaube, Bild, Baum,
Himmel. These responses are about equally similar and dissimilar
to Olgct's, the two occm-rences of Himmel being particularly notable.
However, as we have already decided that the Rudi responses cannot
be taken too seriously it will be wiser not to press this point.
All these facts, fragmentary as they are, point to the conclusion
that the trance is genuine and that Olga is a personality artificially
induced or suggested for the purpose of the sittings and hence
Urmted in its scope to its function as a trance-personality.
The Information available to Olga
It has been alleged that the trance personality is aware of what
goes on in the dark seance-ioom.. In these sittings the medium in
trance still claimed these powers and was put to the following test.
One of the sitters (0. G.) put his hand in one of three positions, "Up,"
" Forward," or " Down ", these positions being checked by the
:
touch of the sitter next to him. The medium in trance in the dark-
ened room made twelve guesses at the 38th sitting on 6 February
1934 at this one in three chance and scored four successes. The
result was not considered good enough to make it worth a more de-
tailed investigation. As recorded below Olga was entirely unaware
of the strength of the infra-red beam in the thermopile apparatus.
On the other hand she said when first questioned about Feda, who
was asked, at a sitting with Mrs Leonard, to get in touch with Olga,
" She has been here tonight." This tallied with what Feda had said.
All attempts at a cross-correspondence, however, failed.
The Infra-Red Investigation
No evidence of absorptions of a beam of infra-red light of the type
recorded by Osty ^ and Herbert ^ could be obtained, notwithstanding

frequent announcements by the trance personality that the " force

had entered the ray.^
The intensity of the infra-red light was measured by means of
thermopiles and a photo-electric cell . The former were used to detect
possible absorptions in the far infra-red beyond the range of the
photo-cell and the latter was used in order to look for absorptions of
short period. Since no effects were observed the instruments were
not calibrated and their exact sensitivity is therefore unknown. Two
thermopiles were used, [a) a Moll linear thermopile of approximate

of 50 ohms and a factor of merit of 2,500.

137] The Mediumship of Rudi Schneider 267
One of the tliermopiles (A, Fig. 3) was placed inside a double-
walled tin box (B) whicli was filled with water, so as to constitute a
water-jacket, and was lagged on the inside with a layer of felt padding
2 cms. thick. The radiation was allowed to enter this box by a red
gelatin window (C). In this way the thermopile was protected from
stray heating effects and draughts and its two brass terminals were
'
given a maximum opportunity of coming to the same temperature
or to a steady difference of temperature. The latter condition is
important to minimise stray thermo-electromotive forces due to
inequalities in their temperature. The thermopiles stood on a plate
!
of glass, coated with paraffin wax to prevent the appearance of a
conducting film of moisture ; and the latter stood on an earthed
sheet of metal. The water-jacketing box (B) was also connected to
earth. The leads from the thermopile were all single strands of
copper wire from double cotton insulation and these were encased
in rubber tubing. They entered the box B by two special holes
(D D^) which were plugged with cotton wool to prevent the entry of
draughts and the wires were firmly spliced to the tin tube filling
these holes. This precaution was to make it impossible to move the
thermopile by pulling on these wires since they were not strong
enough to move the whole box B. This procedure ensured that any
stray vibrations in the room set up by the medium's breathing or
for other reasons could not produce deflections in the galvanometer.
This precaution was not sufficient, however, to render the galvano-
meter reading insensible to someone deliberately pulling the leads.
Since the wires were on the far side of the apparatus to the medium
this was deemed adequate as a preliminary precaution, and the
maximum effect observed during control experiments when the leads
were pulled deliberately was only 4 mm. on the galvanometer
scale.
The leads were carried on an equipotential railway, of the type
advocated by White ^ and by Maass,^ so that they came in contact
only with glass rods which were supported on bits of metal that were
all connected to earth. As a further precaution the rods were fitted
with a solution of rubber and paraffin wax in carbon tetrachloride to
prevent a conducting film of moisture appearing on them. The leads
were twisted round several of the glass rods so as to prevent mechan-
ical shocks to the wires from transmitting forces to the galvanometer
which was directly attached to one lead. The other lead came to an
anti-thermo-electric switch of the type used by one of us (0. G.) ^ in
work on adiabatic calorimetry.
The principle is to make contact by dipping two spirals of copper

wire into a cup containing mercury. The cup is drilled in a sheet of
ebonite that stood upon an earthed sheet of metal, the metaUic ends
of the spirals were amalgamated by dipping into a saturated solution
of mercury chloride to ensure a contact where the mercury wetted the
copper, and the upper ends of the spirals were shellaced over thin
cotton insulation so as to ensure thermal equilibrium with the mer-
cury before electrical contact was made. A finger inserted into one
of these mercury cups produced a deflection of 1 cm. disappearing
in 10 seconds to zero, so they can be said to be adequately immune
from stray heating eifects and also from bad contacts. At the other
side of this switch the lead was carried on an equipotential railway
and inside its rubber tube to the galvanometer.
The galvanometer box was a double box packed with cotton wool
between its two walls and the leads were led into it through glass
tubes shut in with sealing wax and so forming a draught-proof entry.
The front of the box was a plain sheet of glass. The two brass
terminals of the galvanometer were therefore in a box that was
thoroughly well shielded, and so stray thermo-electric effects were
reduced. The galvanometer itself stood on a 10 cm. pile of alternate
sheets of glass (2 mm.) and layers of paper approximately 1 cm.
thick. In this way insulation and freedom from vibration was
secured. The whole box was placed on a sheet of earthed metal and
the two were nailed to the table in the observer's cabinet. In this way
deflections due to a person jumping in the smj?-ce-room were found
to be dead-beat and of the order of 8 mm., falling in 2 seconds to
zero. The galvanometer reading was observed on a scale at approxi-
mately 1 metre, the exact position being adjusted each time the
observer (0. G.) set the apparatus going. This procedure was neces-
sary in order to allow room for the observer to enter the observation
cabinet, which had to occupy a minimum space in order to allow the
trance personahty to have her cabinet of suitable shape and sufficient
size.
The source of light used in the thermopile system was a 240 watt
lamp run through a rheostat off the 100 volt direct current mains.
This powerful source was put in Avith a view to a possibility of wishing
to do spectrographic work with the linear thermopile. It was en-
closed in a double-walled water-jacketed copper oven which was
connected to earth. In the second series of experiments the voltage
across this lamp was read on a Cambridge Paul Universal Unipivot
galvanometer and by use of a calibration curve all readings could be
corrected for the voltage across the lamp. The energy falhng on the
thermopile after passing through the filters was found to vary
approximately as the square of the voltage. Data for one calibration
curve are given in Table III.

All visible light was excluded from the beam by a sheet of ebonite of
thickness 0-005 cm. or by a filter of 1 cm. of a saturated solution of
iodine in carbon disulphide in a glass vessel, or by both. The latter
filter was used because the photographic work of Rayleigh ^ and
Herbert ^ indicated that absorptions, unless of extreme rapidity, did
not occur at wave lengths shorter than 1/x while Herbert and Osty
using photo-cells both recorded absorptions. No alternating current
circuits ran close to the thermopile system, and therefore screening
of the circuit was unnecessary. The same holds also for the Moll
galvanometer, as it is a moving coil instrument.
Osty, doubtless relying on the early work of Lange on copper oxide
photo-electric cells, claimed that his cells were sensitive up to 6/x and
the iodine solution was therefore selected because Coblenz gives for
it the following transmissions :

Since only the ebonite filter was used, the range of incident radiation
must have been extended much farther into the infra-red.
It is evident, however, that the range up to 5/x given with the solu-
tion filter alone is adequate, since a careful calibration at the National
Physical Laboratory of one of Osty's cells taken over by one of us
(Th. B.) from Paris gave the following figures. The sensitivity at a
series of wave lengths is given in Table V expressed in milliamperes
per watt of incident radiation falling on a circular patch, 2 cm. in

diameter, centred with respect to the ruled guide on the surface of
the cell, which is connected in an external circuit whose resistance is
of the order of 30 ohms. The sensitivity becomes negligible at a
wave length of l-800/< and the spectrum, though explored down to
3/<, showed no discoverable recurrence of sensitivity with the energy
available in the spectroscopic system. This is to be contrasted with
a lower limit of 1-4/^ in the case of the best caesium photo-electric
cells.

The thermopile system described above gave a 40% drop in its total
deflection for an absorption occupying ^ second and was frequently
steady enough for deflections of less than |% to have been detected.
It is therefore claimed that the thermopile system was both sensitive
137] The Mediumship of Eudi Schneider 271
enough, and rapid enough, to detect absorptions of the type previously
recorded and the surface density of illumination was kept low, as this
is supposed ^ to increase the chance of observing absorptions. Full
records of the actual results obtained at all the sittings are available
at the Society and specimen records are given below. In certain
cases the fact that all possibility of absorption was less than 2% has
to be left to the second by second observations by one of us (0. G.).
In some cases the force is said to enter the ray and the observations
given whenever the spot moved by 1 mm. are such, as to show the
reader that on that occasion any deflection corresponded to less than
j%. In one case and only one case there appeared to be a genuine
absorption > 3% and it seemed to amount to a 16% absorption.
On this occasion it was subsequently discovered (1) that water was
leaking out of the water-jacketed box surrounding the thermopile,
(2) that one of the thermopile terminals was touching a moist piece of
felt inside the box. In view of the failure to repeat this one " absorp-
tion " on any other occasion throughout the whole series of sittings
this one result is attributed to experimental error. Thus the result
when contrasted with 80% absorptions alleged to occur during 10
minute intervals ^ are seen to be definitely negative. In view of the
absence of positive results and the trouble of simultaneously record-
ing the voltage of the mains and the galvanometer readings on a
photographic plate all these observations were dictated through to
the secretary in the oliice. Whenever the spot shifted across one of
the millimetre lines on the scale the change if observed was recorded,
though occasional exceptions were made to this rule when the read-
ings seemed of trivial importance as compared with alleged move-
ments of curtains.

A slit of approximately 1 cm. diameter was used and the solution of
" iodine " in carbon bisulphide as filter. The time when the ray was
used last before this sitting both filters were being used simultane-
ously and the beam was therefore less intense. Hence Olga was in
error in stating at 7.6 that the beam was hotter than on the last
occasion when correspondingly lower thermopile deflections were
obtained.

The figures for the 51st sitting show that if the power on that occa-
sion was exerting an absorbing action on the ray it was less than
|-%. At this point it is interesting to point out that the alleged trans-
parency of the " force " to visible radiation since it cannot be photo-
graphed can hardly be reconciled conventionally with the view that
this radiation is capable of harming the force. Any harmful effect
would be expected to become apparent only when some radiation
was absorbed. Perhaps the radiation is to be supposed injurious
only to the medium in trance and not the force ; but this alternative
is hard to reconcile with (a) the statements made by the medium in
trance, and {b) what would be expected on general physiological
grounds.

In this sitting exact timing of the rapidly fluctuating spot was
impossible since all records were dictated first by 0. G. to Th. B. and
then, at once, by the latter to the olB.ce by telephone. Movements
such as were obtained on this evening were never observed at any of
the other sittings. It is concluded that they are due to faulty insu-
lating owing to water escaping into the thermopile box and one of
the terminals of the latter touching a moist piece of felt that was
glued to the metal box. This source of error was due to faulty
soldering of the walls of the box, which was moved during the week
by the caretaker. The error, however, was detected and corrected
before the 30th sitting in January. Owing to the results of this
evening a voltmeter to measure the voltage of the mains was in-
stalled for the next series of sittings to check independently the
energy being emitted by the source. The observed fluctuations of
voltage in the next series of sittings were neither large enough nor
rapid enough to account for the results of the 29th sitting. These
are therefore attributed to faulty insulation and are highly significant
in showing the errors liable to arise from minor flaws in the set up of
the apparatus.
I
278 Report of an Investigation into [part
The actual arrangement of the beam, which was entirely un-
focussed, is illustrated in Figure 3. The whole apparatus including
the source and the thermopile was enclosed by placing a wooden
box E over it. This box and the stand supporting the thermopile
and the source were nailed to the floor. They were both covered
with a black cloth that was screwed to the floor by pegs through
which was run a fine steel cable that was also earthed. In this way
the only access to the ray was a hole opposite the opening between
the two portions of the cabinet curtain. The diameter of their aper-
ture, which was loosely closed with a piece of muslin cut into four
pieces that could each be moved back with the lightest pressure, was
varied from 20 cms. to about 5. At times the muslin was completely
removed and in all cases the medium in trance announced that the
" force " had no difficulty in getting into the ray. The ray itself was
feeble enough to be suitable, according to the trance personality,
which however was found to be in error when tested on one occasion,
to see if it was aware of the relative strength of the beam at two
different sittings (see the '20th sitting above). An electric stove
placed near the thermopile outfit but unable to shine directly in
through the window of the thermopile box produced no appreciable
deflection of the galvanometer in a period of two minutes.
The photo-electric cell used was a copper-copper oxide cell of
type PAj as sold by the Westinghouse Brake and Saxby Signal Co.,
generating a current that is given in milliamperes per Watt of inci-
dent radiation in Table X.

The cell has an approximate resistance of 1800 ohms and was con-
nected in series to a Cambridge Instrument Co. portable electro-
cardiograph Einthoven galvanometer having a 1400 ohms gilt glass
fibre. With this external resistance the cell should be working near
its maximum efficiency, since 1400 is not very different from 1800
ohms. The source of light was a torch bulb run off a 6 volt accumu-
lator and the filter used was a 1 cm. saturated solution of iodine in
carbon disulphide in a glass vessel. The cell was rested on glass and
paper to insulate it and free it from vibrations, and was only some
15-20 cms. from the source of light. Both were enclosed in a rec-
tangular muslin box whose edges were ribs of wood. The box was
nailed to the floor and a hole 10 cms. in diameter in the muslin was
made on the side of the box next to the cabinet. This box was close
to the medium's chair, which was also screwed to the floor, and only
rose some 10 cms. from the floor. The force apparently had no
difficulty in entering this ray either, if the words of the medium in
trance are to be beheved. Photographic records were not taken since
nothing was seen when the naked eye of the observer watched the
shadow of the fibre. It is estimated that an absorption lasting only
some 0-04 seconds would have been observed however in this way.
The string galvanometer cannot be kept as steady as the Moll gal-
vanometer spot because the tension of the fibre is a function of the
temperature of the fibre and its carrier. If used for long periods at
a time the instrument warms up and the tension of the fibre varies
and has constantly to be readjusted. The total deflections amounted
in some cases to 81 mm. and an absorption of 1% should have been
detected with certainty by this method. The precision and the
steadiness could have been increased by being more careful to
protect the Einthoven galvanometer from vibrations. The latter
from time to time caused small deflections which occurred when the
force was not in the ray according to the trance personality. A
number of figures are given below to show that no absorptions were
observed in this ray.

Similar results occurred on the other occasions when the " force

was said to enter the ray, and occasionally a kick Avhen the observer
said fiinf owing to the vibrations he himself set up. These kicks
could be set up without the presence of the medium. One observed

The maximum deflection ever obtained with the cell was 81 units
different from its zero. Thus a deflection of 1% should have been
detectable but was never observed in conditions that made the
deflection seem to have its origin with an absorption owing to the
" force " from the medium.
Temperature Tests
Two small wooden boxes were fixed to the wall of the cabinet
where Olga collected the " force " and an ordinary glass drinking
tumbler was put into each of them and was tightly packed into the
box with cotton wool. A piece of 32 gauge constantan wire was
soldered to the ends of two copper leads and one junction was put m
one tumbler and the other junction in the other tumbler. The leads
and also the constantan wire were encased in rubber tubing except
at the thermo-j unctions. They were carried on an cquipotential to an
antithermo-electric switch of the type described before and thence
to the same Moll galvanometer as was used in the thermopile circuit.
The circuit contained only three single strands of copper wire, the
switch, the galvanometer, and the constantan wire. The insertion of
a hand into the upper part of either tumbler rapidly produced a
deflection of three or four centimetres on the galvanometer scale.
137] The MedmmsMp of Rucli Schneider 281
The sensitivity of the apparatus was calculated from the thermo-
electric force per degree centigrade of a copper constantan thermo-
junction which is about 38 x 10"^ volts per degree centigrade and
the resistance of the circuit which was roughly 80 ohms. In con-
sequence 1 mm. on the galvanometer scale should correspond to
some 0-01°C. During a sitting the lower box slowly became cooler,
but this occurred during control experiments as well. The force on
several occasions was announced by the medium in trance to have
gone into the lower box and it stayed there for several periods of
20 minutes. On no occasion was any change of temperature detected.
These results, some of which are given below, agree with the fact that
measurements with the thermopile when the source of infra-red light
was turned off also showed no heating or coohng effect when the
" force " was said to be where the beam of infra-red light usually was.

A fall in reading corresponds to an increase in temperature of the
lower box relative to the upper box, as was shown by inserting a hand
into the tumbler.

Througliout there is slight fall in temperature of the lower box.
There is no significant effect when the force enters the box, while it is
there, or as it leaves. This is also so on the many other occasions
that this apparatus was used.
A search of mitogenetic properties of the "force ". —It was thought
that the " force ", though unable to affect the ray, might conceivably
have a mitogenic power owing to some telepathic mechanism. _
Ee-
cent work by Gray and Ouillet ^ shows, for instance, that even if the
biological evidence of Gurwitsch ^ for mitogenic rays is accepted they
cannot be supposed to be ultra-violet radiation. The actual experi-
ments were performed on two strains of Bacillus fluorescens and on
samples of dormant yeast. No result of the action of the force was
observed, but none of the experiments were of a high order of
accuracy. Thus, on 10 November 1933, eight tubes of Bacillus
fluorescens were taken into the seance-room in two different boxes.
At each stage of their history the tubes were redistributed in a ran-
dom manner between two boxes so that the controls should be
adequate. The force was said by the medium in trance to have been
in the box containing tubes A, C, F and H from 9.34^ till 9.56 and
again from 11.46-11.57, making 32| minutes in all. The bacteria
were then counted in a sample, the count extending over ten cells.
The results given are the mean of ten such counts and the results
are as follows :

The ten counts for A gave values that varied from 10-18 with a
standard deviation of 2-35. For the mean of four tubes would there-
9.35
fore expect a standard error of " and a difference of 2-35 between
the means would be regarded as worthy of inspection by the t-
distribution formula of "Student". Since 18-2 - 16-6 = 1-6, the
difference is not significant. A more careful test is to calculate

and look up in Student's tables of t for n = n^ +^^2.
This procedure gives t = 0-34 for n = 6. There is thus approximately
a chance of 0-75 that a homogeneous population Avould be found to
exhibit the observed discrepancy owing to pure chance. The results
are not significant.
On 12 December 1933 a larger number of tubes containing cultures
of Bacillus fluorescens liquefaciens was put into each of the two
temperature-measuring tumblers and the " force " was announced
to have gone into the lower box from 8.31-9.5, which amounts to
34 minutes in all. Two counts, each in 10 cells, was made on five
tubes from each box. The remaining tubes were not counted since
they would not have produced a great increase in accuracy. The
results were :

For n,= lS there i>s a probability of about 0-65 that t should exceed
0-G, so that the observed discrepancy between the upper and lower
boxes probably arose from errors of random sampling. _
A t = 2 would be regarded as significant, so that if a:„ - a\ which

been significant. Thus this method would have detected a 28%
difference in the counts of the two series. Alternatively the number
of counts should have been multiplied by ten and refer to 100 tubes
in all in order to achieve an accuracy of 8%.
On Tuesday, 4 November 19:33, three tubes of dormant yeast were
put in one temperature box and three in the other. The force was
atinoiinced to have gone into the box containing tubes 3, 4 and 5,
while the controls 2, 6 and 7 were not influenced by it. The force
was in the box from J 1.12 to 11.20. making 8 minutes in all. The
C0.2 evolved by these tubes was subsequently measured for If hours.
The results for the COg evolved in the last 1| hours were as follows :

For the standard error of the mean divide by ^3 and obtain Sin =0-09

Since 4-44 - 4-28 = 0-10, the difference between the two samples is
not significant. It is therefore concluded that no significant difference
in the rate of growth of two strains of Bacillus fluorescens or in the
fermenting power of yeast was observed owing to the alleged presence
of the force.

REVIEW
C. G. Jung : Modern. Man in Search of a Soul, translated by W. S.
Dell and Gary F. Baynes. London : Ke^an Paul, Trench,
Trubner and Co., 1933. Pp. ix+282. iOs. 6d.
This book is not the systematic examination of contemporary
spiritual adventures which its English title might suggest ; nor on
the other hand is it, like so much psycho-analytic literature, a mere
digest of clinical material. Of the eleven lectures which compose it,
the majority were first published in German in 1931, as part of a
volume entitled Seelenprobleme der Gegenwart ; the remainder are
now collected for the first time from scattered publications. They
deal discursively with various wider aspects and implications of
" analytical psychology "
—its postulates and aims, its bearing upon
literature, anthropology, religion and ethics, above all its thera-
peutic value in the disordered world of to-day. They are addressed
in the main to that section of the educated lay public which looks
to the psychologist for the sort of practical guidance that was once
expected of the clergy. While they are less systematic than, for
example, Freud's New Introductory Lectures, they are also much less
technical ;
they are refreshingly free from vanity and dogmatism ;
and they raise questions which are of fundamental importance for
western civilisation. Jung has here left the consulting room for the
market place—one might almost say, for the pulpit.
Although the book contains one or two references to parapsycho-
logy, its interest for the psychical researcher is marginal rather than
direct. Jung's Weltanschauung is much more favourable to " oc-
cultism " in general than is Freud's :. in the growth of spiritualism,
theosophy, and even astrology, he sees a necessary reassertion of the
intuitive or religious side of man's life against the dominance of the
conceptual thinking associated with modern science. This necessity
is not, however, the same thing as validity : he quotes spiritualism,
along with the hallucinations of the insane and certain experiences
of primitive man, as an example of the law that relatively indepen-
dent psychic contents always tend to be personified. His own view
is that " we cannot know whether anything happens to a person after
he is dead." But the idea of life after death is for him one of the
" primordial thoughts ", which though " incommensurable " with
science are " indispensable conditions of the imagination " and may
have to be revived and encouraged for therapeutic purposes. The
physician's ultimate task, he says elsewhere, is to convey to the
28
Review 287
patient " the healing fiction, the meaning that quickens—for it is
this that the patient longs for, over and above all that reason and
science can give him." This of course raises two issues, one ethical,
the other practical : is it intellectually honest to " convey " opinions
which one does not share ; and how can such a procedure be success-
ful with educated patients who are capable of distinguishing the
truth of a belief from its usefulness and are on their guard against
suggestion ? To neither question does Jung give a satisfactory
answer. When he falls back, as he does, upon the statement that
" all psychic happenings are real it is difficult not to suspect him
of an elementary confusion. For the reality which belongs to every
judgement qua " psychic happening " is not, even for a pragmatist,
the same thing as its truth. And while the psychologist as physician
may plead that questions of truth are irrelevant to his work, if he
aspires to be a teacher he can no longer equate " this judgement is
true " either with " this judgement is made " or with " this judge-
ment is mentally hygienic."
Jung remarks that " every psychology—my own included— has
the character of a subjective confession." And it is extremely inter-
esting to observe how widely the path of analytical psychology as
outlined by Jung has diverged from the psycho-analysis which the
Freudian school, using the same fundamental concepts and faced
with the same fundamental problems, has developed under the
influence of a very different temperament. While rightly recognising
in Freud " a great idealist ", and paying generous tribute to the im-
portance of his discoveries, Jung mocks (not without justification)
at the Freudian " nursery-tales about the terrible old man of the
tribe " ;
he also (more questionably) regards Freud's teaching as
" hostile to spiritual values ", since it is a psychology without the
soul. In contrast, Jung's system might be described as a religion
without a creed (he himself compares it with the discipline of Yoga).
It has a minister, a ritual, a sacrament of confession and absolution ;
above all, it has as its central mystery a process of conversion or re-
birth which " cannot be compassed by the rational concepts of con-
sciousness," because it is no mere re-education of wayward instincts
but " the bringing into being of a new centre of equilibrium."
" The archetypes come to independent life and serve as spiritual
guides for the personality. . . . This spontaneous activity of the
psyche often becomes so intense that visionary pictures are seen or
inner voices heard." These are the classical symptoms of religious
conversion. But to what is the patient converted 'I His spiritual
director does not know or (apparently) very much care. The psycho-
therapist " must have no fixed ideas as to what is right, nor must he
pretend to know what is right and what not—otherwise he takes
something from the richness of the experience." " Whether energy
288 Review
is God, or God is energy, concerns me very little, for how, in any
case, can I know such things ?
" It is as though the psychological
machinery of conversion were set working in vacuo, as a wholesome
spiritixal exercise with no purpose beyond itself. What sets it work-
ing seems to be in the end simply the powerful and sympathetic
personality of the spiritual healer. That is why " the attitude of the
psychotherapist is infinitely more important than the theories and
methods of psychotherapy." And that is also why Jung, with all
his imaginative insight and breadth of vision, is unlikely to leave
behind him any such school of scientific therapists as that founded
by his master and rival. Jung is a great personality and a pene-
trating observer ; he is not a great scientific or philosophical thinker.

OBITUARY
Dr Walter Franklin Prince
{Died, 1th August, 1934)
Although Dr Walter Prince's many friends in England had been
aware that lie had not enjoyed the best of health for several years,
the news of his death in August came to them as a great shock.
Dr Prince's career in psychical research was a very remarkable
one. It was not till 1909, when he was already middle-aged, that
he was first brought in touch with the subject through his position
as clergyman of an Episcopalian Chiirch in New York. One day
there walked into his church a young woman, whose obvious mental
and physical ill-health made demands on his sympathy. She was
the " Doris Fischer " of the now famous case of multiple personality,
and later on was adopted by Dr and Mrs Prince, and as Miss Theo-
dosia Prince looked after Dr Prince during his latter years.
Considering the nature of his previous training, Dr Prince's treat-
ment of the Doris Fischer case and his presentation of it in vols.
Lx.-xi. of the Proceedings of the American Society for Psychical
Research must be reckoned among the most remarkable feats in
modern psychology. Some of the incidents arising in the treatment
of the case turned Dr Prince's ever alert mind towards a closer study
of supernormal phenomena, and he rapidly became known as one of
the leading figures in the psychical research of our generation. His
deafness prevented him, as he was fully aware, from ever becoming
a first-rate observer of the physical phenomena of the seance room,
but except in that limited field, his critical ability, open-mindedness
and philosophic grasp enabled him to make contributions to psy-
chical research of very great importance. Besides the Doris Fischer
case one may mention his report on Senora Maria Reyes de Z.,
which together with the earlier investigations of the same medium
by Dr Pagenstecher, constitutes the most important evidence on the
debated subject of psychometry ; his examination of the automatic
writings of Patience Worth, and various spirited but fruitless
attempts to reduce to order the chaotic condition of the terminology
of psychical research.
Dr Prince had been Research Ofiicer of the American S.P.R. for
several years before the disruption in that Society in 1925, which led
to the formation of the Boston S.P.R. Of the new Society he was
at once appointed Research Ofiicer and held that post till his death,
u 289
290 Dr Walter Franklin Prince [part
He was elected a Corresponding Member of our own Society in 1921,
and was President for the years 1930, 1931.
Our Society was privileged to hear him deliver two papers of out-
standing interest. His Presidential Address to the S.P.E. is an im-
portant pronouncement, by one fully qualified by experience to make
it, on the progress made and the degree of certainty attained in
different branches of psychical research, and the factors which
conduce to or hinder further development. The other paper was
an account (afterwards printed by the Boston S.P.R.) of a tour of
investigation on the Continent. For substance and style this paper
would on its own lines be hard to beat.
Attention should also be drawn to the short but valuable summary
printed in the Transactions of the Congress at Copenhagen of the
bearing of the evidence for telepathy on the problem of survival.
Certain phenomena since reported would very likely have induced
Dr Prince to modify his statement in detail, though not the general
tenor of his argument.
Dr Prince held the view, and stated it frequently and with great
emphasis, that the evidence of psychical research supported a belief
in survival, but his keen criticism of certain of the phenomena upon
which the case for spiritualism is often based, prevented his ever
becoming a champion entirely acceptable to the spiritualists. It is
a position that is very well understood in this country.
But it would not be proper to conclude an obituary notice of Dr
Prince without laying emphatic stress on the degree to which quali-
ties not only of intellect, but of personal character—his friendly
candour and his absolute trustworthiness—contributed to the im-
portance and permanent value of his work.
IN MEMORY OF WALTER FRANKLIN PRINCE
With the death of Walter Franklin Prince, which occurred on 7th
August, 1934, Psychical Research has lost one of its outstanding
figures.
Born at Detroit on 22nd April, 1863, Mr Prince graduated in 1881,
taking his A.B. at Yale in 1896 and his Ph.D. a few years later.
Attracted to the religious life, he became a B.D. of Drew Theologi-
cal Seminary and then followed a number of Church appointments
in Brooklyn and elsewhere.
As early as 1900, Dr Prince exhibited characteristic traits which
were afterwards to dominate his whole life. He became an Assistant
Secretary to the Law and Order League of Connecticut and his
interest in legal methods were shown by his papers on the First
Criminal Code of Virginia, on the Blue Laws, and above all by his
paper on the " Great Slave Conspiracy Delusion," wliich he pub-
lished in the Saturday Chronicle of New Haven, Conn, in 1902. In
138] Obituary 291
;
this paper he examined the evidence as seen in the documents and
suumied up his findings in the way so familiar to readers of his later
: papers on psychical research. It was, he wrote, " the crowning
judicial atrocity of American History." On 25th May, 1934, in a
,
letter to the present writer, he described another worlc which had
I
just been published as " the worst printed crime in the history of
Psychic Research."
It was in dealing with documentary material that Dr Prince ex-
i
hibited his greatest powers. During his work with the American
Society for Psychical Research (1917-1920) and latterly with the
Boston Society his principal achievements have been in his analyses
[
of various cases, although in practical work the investigation of the
Doris Fischer Case will always be remembered. Although he fully
recognized the importance of skilled field work and did his utmost
to acquire knowledge of the psychological and mechanical aids to
fraud he was never entirely at home in the laboratory, for he was
great enough to know that without a long and laborious training it
would be impossible for him to observe in the way that he knew was
necessary.
During the tenure of office of the writer with the American
Society, at the time that Dr Prince was still with it, we were in
almost daily consultation. A deep friendship and rare under-
standing grew up between us, which was never marred even by later
differences of opinion. We continued a long and confidential corre-
spondence almost to the day of his death. In his last letter he ex-
pressed the wish that " so many miles did not intervene, so that we
might often meet face to face." Had he not left us we should have
met this autumn in his beloved home at Hingham, Mass.

THE FIRE WALK
By E. S. Thomas
" Mr Frazer ", says Mx Andrew Lang (in Magic and Religion) " is
interested mainly in the religious, magical, or ritual significance of
(the fire walk) which varies in different places. To me on the other
hand the immunity of the performers appears a subject worthy of |
physiological enquiry." Sir James Frazer on his side notes that
" eyewitnesses who have described the rite in Oceania have said
little or nothing as to its meaning and purpose : their whole attention
having been apparently concentrated on the heat of the furnace and j|
the state of the performers' legs before and after passing through it."
'
In preparing this paper I have studied some 27 cases of what I
shall call the ember walk as practised by Asiatics, and 10 of the stone
walk of Oceania, and my verdict would be that Mr Andrew Lang has
the better claim on our sympathy. For the purposes of this paper
the object of the rite or ceremony has been of secondary importance.
Yet a few words regarding the antiquity, significance and geo-
graphical distribution of the performance will not be out of place.
The oldest reference to it comes from India, ^ in the story of a
contest as to which of two priests was the better Brahmin. It was
decided by walking a fire of red-hot embers. The story is as old as
800 B.C., but it is referred to in one of the Samhitas of the Taittiriyas
400 years before this. About 300 B.C. it was enacted that the fire-
walk or the holding of red-hot iron should be the test of the veracity
of a witness. Its connection with the story of Sita, wife of Rama,
who proved her innocence and virginity by walking the fire, is too
well known to be more than referred to. In modern times it is
performed by Hindus as an expiation for sin, as a demonstration of
the power of mind over matter, in fulfilment of a vow-bargain made
in illness or misfortune, and as an obligation for the tenure of a post
in the temple. In the background there is in some cases the sug-
gestion that it is also implicitly a vernal or fertility rite, with a
dominant idea of its purificatory power. In China it is certainly a
solar or vernal fete, and it is probably the same in Japan, where it is
also performed as a sign of spiritual power, and with a purificatory
object. In the South Seas on the other hand, only members of a
certain family are said to have the power to walk the hot stones,
decendants of a man upon whom it was bestowed by a mythological
eel in return for its life, although as the huge oven is also used to
roast the first fruits and early fruits of the Ti or Dracaena root-

harvest, a vernal sionificance seems to be present both in this part
of the ceremony and the season of year when it is usually performed.
The famous classical examples of the ember walli:,! at Mount
Soracte, near Rome, practised, it is interesting to note, by a member
of a particular family, and at Castabala in S. Cappadocia, are well
authenticated as to the fact by Virgil, Strabo, and Pliny. lambli-
chus 2 the Philosopher mentions the piercing of the bodies of walkers
with skewers, a practice followed, as we shall see, by Hindu walkers
to-day.
An arresting sentence in Ezekiel 28, 14 describing the King of
Tyre walking up and down amidst the stones of fire, which Sir James
Frazer accepts as evidence for the stone-walk in antiquity, appears,
unfortunately, to be a corrupt passage misconstrued ; Dr Moffat's
translation has " flashing jewels " in place of " stones of fii-e
"
; so
that we are left with the story of the Three Children as the sole
possible reference to an analogous experience in the Bible.
Andrew Lang ^ quotes the Berseker's boast from the Icelandic
" Flatey Book " —" I can walk through the burning fire with my
bare feet " as a possible reference to the practice. In a legend of a
pupil of St Brigid, who filled her shoes with cinders to purge her soul
of fleshly desires, Professor R. A. S. MacAllister * sees a tradition of it
also in pre-Christian Ireland. But Spain and Bulgaria are the only
two regions in Europe where the ember-walk is definitely recorded.
The antiquity of the records of the ember walk point to a source
among Aryan peoples. Its present distribution is as follows :
Hindus and Hindu emigrants practise it to-day in India, the Straits
Settlements, Mauritius, Trinidad and S. Africa. Hindu influence in
China and Japan in the past is very evident in the Buddhism of both
countries and the practice may well have reached them therefore
from India. Although in India Moslems walk the fire, particularly
at the Moharrem festival, no cases appear to be reported from other
Islamic countries. In North America frenzied Cheyenne ^ Indians
used to rush into fires and trample them out, in Yucatan ^ men walk
or rush over red-hot cinders to avert expected calamity, and in
Australia treading out or treading on fire is practised in initiation
ceremonies. We are told that in Yucatan they are sometimes un-
scathed, but it is clearly not done in any of these cases as a demon-
stration of immunity from burns.
In Oceania alone are hot stones walked, and the distribution there

coincides with the peregrinations of the hereditary Fijian fire-
walkers. The ceremony may well have reached them through
Indian traders and have been transferred from the bed of hot embers
to the dracaena oven.
In Spain and Bulgaria it is singular that, like the classical fire
walkers of Mt Soracte, some cases in India, and as generally reported
in the South Sea Islands, the fire walkers should belong to a parti-
cular family or caste. In Spain they were reported in the nineteenth
century to have the hereditary power of going into the flames and,
by dint of charms, permitted by the Inquisition, of extinguishing
fires. ^ In Bulgaria the family are called Nistinares and the power is
attributed to Sts Constantine and Helena. About 21st May, the day
of these Saints, the desire to walk the fire comes upon them, especi-
ally when certain music is made. After processions and sacrifices of
oxen and rams, fires are lit, and, filled with ecstasy by the music,
they dance in the flame in turn until, the power leaving them, they
feel the heat and withdraw.^ No details are given as to the state of
their feet before or afterwards.
I now turn to the evidence proper, beginning with China. The only
detailed report ^ of the ceremony is 73 years old. It took place amidst
scenes of frenzied excitement. Round an area of red-hot charcoal,
20 feet in diameter, a Taoist priest walked, throwing on rice and salt
to conjure the flames and assure a propitious year. Two exorcists
facing one another across the area then beat the surface with whips
representing snakes. Then they walked across and two of the
peasant performers, who had practised fasting and continence for a
week, crossed and recrossed until it was trodden down. The Great
Crod's image was then carried across and back three times by twenty
similarly trained peasants. The witness, Herr Schlegel, a German,
was not impressed. He attributed their immunity from burns to
their horny foot-soles placed flat. He had seen the protagonists of
one of these ceremonies flogged as impostors next day by Govern-
ment officials. The salt and beating of the embers would certainly
tend to lower the temperature and hasten the production of ash. It
will be remembered that the men with the whips faced each other
and we may guess that the path followed was this beaten one.
In Japan the throwing on of salt is also recorded, and the feet are
dipped in salt before walking. The surface too is beaten and to
greater efl^ect, with long poles. Mr H. G. Pouting, one of the re-
corders of the Japanese ceremony,^ walked the 20 foot length after
dipping liis feet in salt, and feeling only a comfortable warmth, re-
peated it at a slower pace. He halted, moreover, in the middle and
trod on the hottest ember he could see (the only indication he gives

of the state of the furnace) and kept his foot there for a second.
He felt a slight sensation of a burn, and a blister formed which gave
no trouble. It seems clear from this very summary account, in
which the details relate to the frenzied excitement into which the
priests worked themselves and the cult accessories, that the coals
were not very hot when Mr Ponting wallied. The embers were of
charcoal which had been brought to a glow with long fans over an
area 20 ft. x 12 x 1 ft. deep, and they had clearly cooled and probably
deposited a good thick coating of ash. He considers that the beating
smooth of the embers had much to do with it, the ostensible effect
of which was doubtless, as in the Chinese rite, to drive out the
inimical spirit of fire.
In a case reported to Sir James Frazer by two eye-witnesses, how-
ever, the conditions seem to have been more severe. One of them,
Mr Foxwell, said " the sweat ran down him " as he stood near the
furnace and he was unable to explain the immunity of the per-
formers. Perceval Lowell, the American writer, was, he said, laid up
for three weeks with burns after walking, while a Scottish engineer
named Hillhouse was unscathed. The probable reason for the im-
munity of the engineer, his hardened foot-soles, does not seem to have
occurred to this observer, and this weakens our faith in the value of
his impressions.
In a third case from Japan, reported in 1903 by the wife of an
American naval officer,^ salt was rubbed on the legs before walking.
The heat appears to have been intense as the lady spectators held
up fans to screen their faces from it, and an English lady shrieked
with alarm ^ when the first of the walkers entered the furnace, of
whom one is reported to have strolled over the 18 feet distance with
no apparent discomfort. The furnace was 18 ft. x 6 x 2 ft. deep.
Straw was laid on charcoal and ignited and the charcoal fanned into
a glow. The ceremony took place at 6 o'clock, when nearly dark,
with a full moon. No details of time intervals are given. The great
heat of the furnace is not incompatible with a good covering of ash,
invisible in the moonlight, to which the bm'nt straw would contri-
bute. Many people followed the protagonists, including boys and a
woman carrying a babe, but we are not told after what interval of
time.
Lastly, in an ember-walk witnessed at Tokio in 1899 by Mr Andrew
Haggard,^ those who were to walk sat stripped in a room by big tubs
of cold water, with which they frequently drenched themselves, work-
ing themselves into excitement meanwhile with long prayers, chants
and gesticulations. He too records that the fire was beaten with long
poles before the walk. Before passing on to the Indian cases two
observations may be made. First, that we are not justified in

assuming, if there is no reference to beating the surface in such |i
sunuuary accounts from China and Japan as those we have to be |t
satisfied with, or to douching with cold water, that these incidents |[
did not take place. The second observation is that nothing is said, j
in any of the above accounts, of the ash which must have formed on
j
the surface. Ash is such a bad conductor of heat that even a thin j
layer would effectively shield a calloused foot from the red-hot i
[
embers during a short contact. |
(
In two cases of the Indian walk the ash is specially mentioned, f
Mr W. E. Beeching ^ witnessed the ceremony in 1933, a Moslem |
performance which took place on a dark night about 3.30 a.m. The j
fire was lit at midnight and contained a good deal of cork. It was ,
spread out with iron rakes which were cooled with water. This t
formed puddles round the embers which lay about 12 inches thick
over an area, one gathers, about 9 feet in diameter. The priest came I
\
decked with garlands from the bath and, after gyrating round the '
j
edge, pranced into the glowing mass. His feet covered to the f
aiikles were slowly withdrawn and as he moved forward the hlach / ,
impresses filled in as the embers slipped into place. He turned and :
f
returned several times. Mr Beeching who desired to walk was told \
\
to wait until he could do so with priestly blessing. He entered in
due course with bare feet, turning up his trousers, and dashed to the j f
other side and back unhurt. He attributes the priest's immunity to j
the ash, his calloused feet, and the mud with which he cleverly coated ;

Mr R. U. Sayce - has described an ember-walk by Indians in 1926 \
at Pieterniaritzburg, S. Africa, with a wealth of anthropological j
detail covering the daily life and food for ten days prior to the f
ceremony of the performers, upon whom strict sexual abstinence and j
thought-control were enjoined, as well as the ritual perambulations (
of a procession with the image of the goddess Draupadi about the ,
furnace, the slaughter of a goat and other matters which are not of j,
much concern to us here. The pit was 30 feet long x 12 feet wide {
and the walkers came up from the river, many with silver hooks in
p
their backs and skewers through tongue and cheeks. They dipped |,
their feet in turmeric water before, and milk and water after, the j
walk. [
Many of the ritual details were obtained three years later from j
prominent local Hindus and not from Mr Sayce's personal observa- ^
tion. He was good enough to write to me on some doubtful points :
j
namely the nature of the " ashes " over which they walked and the j,
method of their preparation. The furnace was a mixture of ash and j
embers some 9 inches thick, prepared by raking bonfires as the fuel ^
was consumed. This implies iron rakes and puddles from their cool- :

ing as ill Mr Beeching's case. The walkers are stated in his account
to have been summoned from the river }vhen all was ready. There is
internal evidence that this was at least 200 yards away, but he does
not remember the distance. He did not apparently witness the
perambulations of the idol (2| times round the furnace) which, with
the sacrifice, are said to have taken place after the return from the
river, all of which would have given time for a considerable deposit
of ash. Most of the performers appeared to collapse after the walk,
for reasons which are obvious enough—the long period of training on
light food, the walk to and from the river, and emotion. A number
of them were accustomed to wear boots, he says ; their immunity
was not due to thick foot-soles. But it is clear that the thickness of
the ash may have compensated for this.
An interesting performance of the ember-walk at Suva in the Fiji
Islands was witnessed by Mr S. M. White ^ in 1932. The performers
approached the furnace (45 ft. x 15 ft.) of wood ashes (presumably
embers and ash) from which all burning sticks had been carefully
removed, supported in a state of prostration by friends after fasting
for fourteen clays and a three mile walk from the sea. Continence
had also been observed. Headed by the priest they walked the
length quite slowly, some three or four times, with no sign of dis-
comfort, their feet sinking in the ashes, and one ploughing his feet
deep on the return journey. Many had skewers through their cheeks
and fleshy parts of their bodies. The surface was white with ash
after tlie walk, but the lieat up wind was too great for the hand to
bear for long at a height of nearly 6 feet. Paper thrown on burst
into flame at once. The heat down wind was like a furnace. The
single crossing, he says, took at least half a minute, the longest time
recorded. This suggests a short (probably dancing) step of 18 inches
every second. There was no sign of blistering or burning even on
the delicate upper surface between the toes, and the soles were
whitish and soft after walking a distance through rivers and (an
important point when coupled with a reference to washing after the
fire walk) along muddy tracks. Their legs were therefore in all
probability coated with wet mud and their feet soft, which would not
lessen the protective virtue of the callus. The ash was clearly deep
at the start of the walk ; while porous it would let the heat radiate
through ; when compacted by the foot it would, as before stated, act
as a shield to the heat. It is clearly the " premier pas qui coute " :
the return journey along the compacted path would be far cooler. I
defer consideration of the great heat of the furnace in this and other
cases until the whole evidence is before us, noting however that we
are not told in what direction they walked as regards the wind. I
would call attention to the common tendency in these accounts to
ignore details (the wind, the tracks, and the mud, for instance)

which while of great scientific importa.n.ce are not realised to be so
by the observer.
A simple case described by Capt. G. R. Hearn^ in which the panda
or priest of a small temple had to plunge knee-deep through burn-
ing cowdung at the Holy festival as a duty attached to his office,
is interesting from the fact that the secret of its successful per-
formance is said only to be revealed by the priest to his successor on
his deathbed, and because having duly prepared himself by fasting
and prayer, he is said to know when he is ready for the ceremony by
the insensibility of his fingers to the flames of a candle. In any case
Capt. Hearn says, the flames are not very severe and he does not
seem surprised to have found his legs unhurt and apparently the
hairs thereon unsinged. The cowdung cakes covered apparently an
area of 10 ft. x 8 ft. and were three feet deep, so that the ash was
probably very thick. In a case witnessed by Mr H. K. Beauchamp ^
near Madras in 1901, water was sprinkled all round the area of
embers, 15 feet square and 3 or 4 inches deep, and we are at liberty
to assume that the walkers gyrated in it as in the observant Mr
Beeching's account. The walk took place at 6 p.m., i.e. after dark,
the fire of a ton of jungle wood and two cartloads of charcoal having
been lit at noon. It is not surprising therefore to read that their feet
sank into the loose bed of fire, as it would have looked and is des-
cribed. And the apparent wading rather than walking was a variant
which was probably introduced with impunity. A glutinous decoc-
tion of aloe was reported to produce immunity to burns, but the
performers rejected the suggestion with indignation. Other decoc-
tions are variously reported but without verification.
In Mr J. G. D. Partridge's ^ account of the ceremony performed in
1902 in India, the priest after frenzied dancing sat in a swing-seat
full of 3 inch thorns without relieving his weight on the ropes. The
thorns pierced his clothes but did not seem to hurt him and there
was no blood on his body. He constantly inhaled incense fumes.
There were two 9-foot pits, one filled with embers and the other with
ashes from a wood-fire. He took four steps in four seconds in each
pit, but this part of the performance did not impress Mr Partridge.
The case I reserve to the last ^ is the most arresting : a Moslem
performance in which some supernormal influence of the fakir or
dervish seems to operate and wane at intervals. It was described by
Mr V. B. Stowell in a letter to his father which the latter sent to Sir
Oliver Lodge. The case was corroborated by his older friend Mr
Quinn. The account was published in the Journal for June 1928.
It apparently took place on 22nd November, 1927. The performance

138] The Fire Walk 299
was in aid of a hospital. The fire trench full of embers was 12 feet
long, narrow and shallow. The writer and Quinn were told they
could walk without getting burned. They did so in their socks and
felt nothing. Afterwards they walked again, through, in addition,
flames two or three feet high of rushes thrown on and ignited,
apparently with paraffin oil. After stepping out, an adhering cinder
burnt a hole in Stowell's sock. While people walked, he says, the fakir
was " worked up into a terrific state of excitement ". At intervals
I
of about a minute the power seemed to leave him and he shouted,
''
" Bass, bass !
" (Enough !). Once Quinn failed to hop out at the cry
and one of his feet was slightly scorched, but without burning his
sock, which, he says, showed it was genuine. (But in this Stowell
was mistaken : Quinn states in a letter to Mrs Salter that his foot
was blistered and his sock scorched). The fire, Quinn states, (pro-
'
bably meaning the heat), was fierce and the embers red hot. Stowell
says the fire was too hot to sit close to. His woollen socks were " not
even frizzled ".
A native friend told Quinn that this fakir alone had this power
and that it was hereditary. He had fasted all day and collapsed
rolling his eyes at the end. Many people walked, including cliildren
i
led by the hand, and finally the band with their instruments. An
I
Indian friend's account was also sent to Mrs Salter. He had walked
I
in his socks and only felt warmth. He related that the loin-cloth of
a Hindu caught fire as he stepped out of the trench and that he was
not even scorched, although a doctor present said he should have
been severely burned. Many people of note attested to the walk
over glowing embers and through flames under the aegis of this
fakir Syed Hussein Atashi, including Lord Sydenham.^
In order to come to some decision regarding the hypernormality
I or otherwise of this account I made a shallow trench 9 feet long and
12 inches wide and filled it with hay. On this I laid folded sheets of
newspaper and a dozen bundles of fire sticks evenly spread, which
just filled it. I lit the hay quickly ail along and as soon as the wood
flames died down I walked across in thin slippers, taking five steps
on the embers. My shoes were quite unscorched, and here I may say
that for this reason I have omitted from this paper all accounts of
walking the fire in shoes,
i
I then walked in my socks, treading five times with four steps as
in ordinary walking, taking three seconds in the process. I did this
four times, making the return journey at once the last time. By then
the glow was deeper in colour, probably due in part to deposit of
ash. I could feel it warm under my feet but there was no discomfort.
My socks were not even singed except where small embers clung to
them, and I felt these burn through the holes they made as I brushed
them off on the bank. (My sock soles (an old pair) were very thin,

not to say threadbare in places). This was the cause of ray delay. 1
"
Clearly then the foot leaves the embers before they have time to
burn. Yet my feet tingled and burned, but not painfully, for
several hours afterwards. If the attention of the walker is dis-
tracted by a call or startling sound, the distraction would lead
probably to a momentary halt upon one foot with consequent burn-
ing. In a large furnace, too, it is not surprising that a fall should, as
in an early case in India related by Mr Stokes,^ lead to such severe
burns on the body as to cause death : although the walkers passed
through unscathed.
As regards Mr StowelFs immunity from flames knee-high, experi-
menting with a 6 foot stretch of blazing hay with flames more than
knee-high I found I could walk it comfortably as before in four
seconds without feeling any heat whatever. I did it three times, but
did not turn in the flames. I waved a piece of cotton cloth to and
fro in the flames, and it caught fixe in from 3 to 4 seconds.
My small experiments then lead me to the conviction that there
is nothing supernormal, as far as the evidence goes, in the immunity
of persons who do the fire-walk in shoes or socks alone, with their
legs protected by clothing. And calloused foot-soles are thicker than
socks. I defer, as I have said, consideration of the possibly para-
normal aspects of the performance until we have considered the
other fire-walk, over heated stones in Oceania (which I call the
stone-walk), and to this I now turn.
The stone-walk in the South Seas presents us at first sight with
several new and baffling factors. It is clear from many of the
accounts that the dramatic and picturesque aspects of the perform-
ance greatly impressed the witnesses, and had inevitably impaired
their critical faculties. The walkers are primarily members of a
family, the Nga Ngalita tribe of Fiji who, they say, inherit the gift
from an ancestor who received it from a deity in eel form. They and
their assistants are arrayed for the ceremony in their picturesque
native costume of garlands and coloured dried leaf-strip skirts and
other ornaments. The ceremony usually takes place close to the
seashore in a coconut-grove, and all is animation and excitement.
The furnace is a pit 2 to 4 or more feet deep, and from 9 to 15 or
20 to 30 feet in diameter. In it poles are sometimes, if not always,
set radially to hold a pile of some 200 stones from 40 to 80 lbs. in
weight, according to one observant witness. These are always of
the same rock, a very vesicular augite-audesite basalt. The fire is I
lit and blazes 4 to 8 hours or more, but usually 36 to 48 hours. Un-
fortunately no account tells us how the fire is fed : one can only
surmise that fresh wood is thrown on, which obviously would not i
impart anything like as much heat to the stones as the logs below, j
When the .spectators gather, the stones glow white and red hot and

138] The Fire Walk 301
are exploding and firing off flakes. Then with loud yells the pic-
turesquely garbed assistants rush in with long green poles having
tourniquet loops of creeper at the end and haul out the blazing logs.
The butts of the poles are next set in line along the surface and
hauled like a rake this way and that with long creeper stems until the
whole is fairly levelled, and sometimes, if not always, a surface is
arranged of fire-split stones turned flat side uppermost. When all is
ready the leader emerges from the grove, usually in deep silence (in
contrast with the Indian ceremony), tall and dignified, garlanded
with flowers, carrying a branch of the Ti plant (the dracaena, whose
root is afterwards cooked in the oven), and walks across or round the
furnace or both. Others may follow, and finally the dracaena roots,
wrapped in succulent hibiscus or other leaves, are laid on with a
quantity of leaves over them. Clouds of steam rise as they pile
earth on the top. Then it is left for four days, by which time it is
cooked. The walk is thus a manifestation of inherited power, as
well apparently as a prelude to the dracaena season, and so a vernal
ceremony.
Two observers have attempted a scientific account of the stone-
walk and these I will consider first.
Dr Robert Fulton, M.B.^ observed it in June 1902 at Bega Island
in the Fiji Group, where it is usually held. The fire, lit 48 hours
before, was glowing fiercely on his arrival, and there was discomfort
at a distance of 10 feet. The oven (lovo) was 20 feet in diameter and
2 feet deep. The stones, he says, fairly glowed and there was little
smoke when after a further two hours the burning embers were re-
moved and the stones turned over and levelled. By this time, he
says, they had undoubtedly cooled, turning from white to red, then
\;
to grey and black. The whole process of preparation, he thinks, took
nearer two hours than one. The heat at the centre was still very
great. The chief walker appeared from the grove and was examined
by Dr Fulton and Dr Smith. His pulse was just over 90, his hands
were cool, his feet cold, perceptibly cooler than the rest of the body,
clean and odourless. The soles were yellow-white, smooth like soft
kid, as in fact they would be after the customary bathe, which is not
mentioned. In addition to the native skirt he wore anl^lets of dry
bracken. There were black hairs on his legs. He then, followed by
some twelve others, walked deliberately across and twice round the
stones : Dr Fulton thought they walked round only, but he was
assured by others that they crossed the centre. One of the men was
examined by Dr Duncan after the walk. His feet, the hairs on his
legs, and the dry fern anklet showed no signs of scorching or burning.
His pulse was 120, and (an interesting point) his feet still cool, if not
cold, although the temperature of his legs was that of a person in high
fever. People with cameras, accustomed to timing, said the walk
1 Transactions of the N.Z. Institute, xxxv. 187.
302 E. S. Thomas [part
lasted 15 seconds : 25 to 30 steps were taken, so that the soles were
not in contact with the stones for more than half a second at a time.
A stone 10 inches by 5 by 2 was removed for him from the centre
of the oven. It was carried in a leaf basket to the shore, where it
steamed and fizzled for several minutes in water : even then it was
too hot to hold. He lost it going on board when it slipped from its
basket and he found it too hot to save from falling into the sea.
Dr Fulton thinks the secret lies not in the calloused feet of the
walker but in the peculiar properties of the rock, which has a very
low specific heat and very slow conductivity. He does not think
(but he offers no evidence for this) that the stones were heated
through, and concludes therefore that the split surfaces were com-
paratively cool. Unfortunately, he does not say whether the surface
stones Avere glowing hot on his arrival. The walk, he further says,
did not begin till most of the stones were split, and he noted the pile
had not collapsed, inferring that the logs had not burned through.
He contends finally that the heat imparted to a foot in contact
would be a fraction of that given out by many other rocks in the
same time, and that in spite of the high temperature the heat given
off would not burn the feet.
Incidentally it should be observed that if 25 to 30 steps measure
circumference and diameter, then the diameter of the prepared
surface must have been about seven steps. In a case to be considered
presently the step appears to have been about 12 inches.
Mr S. P. Langley ^ witnessed the stone-walk in Tahiti in 1901 and
was the first to give scientific attention to it. The pit was 9x21x2
feet deep. He ascertained the composition of the rock, weighed an
average stone, and estimated the number at 200, with an average
weight at 40 to 80 lbs. The fire was lit at midday and burned till
4.40, when the logs were removed. After such a short period it is
not surprising that the outer stones did not burn his hands, although
the lowest layers of stones, which lay four deep in the middle, were
red hot. The upper central stones also gave out considerable heat.
The upper stones looked unsafe for naked feet, but an engineer told
him he had seen natives standing on steam pipes at 300° F. The
chief walker, Papa Ita, said he was able to walk through spells and
the aid of a goddess, after two or three days spent in prayer. He
and two disciples in native dress walked when all was ready, the
former over the centre with hirrried steps, the latter half-way to the
edge. He turned and walked back with deliberate confidence
accompanied by new disciples who clearly picked a cooler path.
After a third and fourth passage Europeans accompanied him in
thin shoes which were not burnt, but the trousers of one were
scorched, doubtless by the flames which were still occasionally licking
up between the stones. He was now allowed to remove a stone from
1 Nature, 22nd August, 1901.
138] The Fire Walk 303
the centre of the pile upon which, he says, somewhat inconsistently,
every foot had rested. It was ovoid and the large end had been in
the hottest part of the fire.
He attempted to estimate its temperature in a bucket, but the
ebullition was so violent that a great deal boiled over. It continued
to boil for ten minutes. The stone weighed 65 lbs., and the esti-
mated temperature (for what it is worth) was 1200°. This rock, it
was found, glowed red hot between 1300° and 1400°, but the tem-
perature on the surface, he says, must have been indefinitely lower.
He found that after standing 8 to 10 seconds in his shoes on the
hottest part of the pile the heat became unpleasant. He could there-
fore have walked in his shoes for 16 to 20 paces. It is unfortunate
that he did not note the time taken on the walk by the performers,
or spent by the assistants in preparing the surface.
One can hardly agree with Mr Langley when, while regretfully
deciding that there was nothing abnormal in the performance he
witnessed, he says he is convinced that he witnessed a typical stone
walk. The difference between his 4| hours and the 36 to 48 hours
recorded by others for the heating process, is considerable. His
information regarding the physical and petrological characters of
the rock used is of great value, but his suspicion based on the use of
this stone and the reported refusal of Papa Ita to use a marble is ill-
founded. A siliceous rock of high specific heat would certainly slag
and marble be calcined in the oven.
I obtained a piece of olivine basalt about 4 inches square and about
3 inches at its thickest, weighing nearly 4 lbs., of much the same
specific gravity (2-5 instead of 2-4), but not so vesicular, and I
heated it in a coal fire all over for 3 hours and then removed it to the
side of the grate. In three minutes it had lost its red glow. On
another occasion I left it on the coals in an anthracite stove for
5 hours and then cracked off an inch-wide piece in the dark. It was
only red hot half through. The small piece I heated all day on a gas
ring and it was only red hot underneath. The rest of the stone I
subsequently heated all over with red coals for 4 hours. On removing
the covering coals and turning it over hottest side up, on the fire, it
again lost its glow in about three minutes.
It is possible to calculate that a spherical stone of 60 lbs. weight
of the same unit weight (specific gravity) as mine would take about
thrice the time to cool ; other shapes, such as oval, not so long. So
we may, I think, feel fairly sure that in 15 minutes any red-hot
stones on the surface would have lost their glow, that is, would have
cooled below red heat. Although I found, like Mr Langley, that the
rock retains its heat afterwards for a very long time, from my experi-
ment it seems probable that after the logs are removed, the tops of
the upper stones would cool as fast or as slowly near the edge of the
furnace as in the hotter middle region. If so, it may be worth
304 E. S. Thomas [part
noting, although we have no information as to the probable internal
state of the hot stones, that I was satisfied by experiment with my
stone that I could have taken three steps barefooted with each (un-
calloused) foot on such rocks, heated all over and cooled in the hearth
for an hour and a quarter, which is about the time taken to prepare
the arena in Dr Fulton's case. After the same period of time I could
have taken 18 steps on the stone heated on the underside only and
cooled outside the grate. Mr Langley thought the upper stones were
not heated through and were therefore much cooler on the flat sur-
faces when they were split, and this may well have been true in his
case at any rate.
If the stone Dr Fulton experimented with, which was about the
thickness of mine, was a typical specimen, then the surface stones
in his furnace would have cooled at about the same rate as my stone.
In spite of the 48 hours heating a great deal of heat must have radi-
ated away in the (say) Ih hours spent in the preparation. In the one
of these two cases, then, we have a short period of heating and an
unknown time spent in preparation ; in the other a long period of
heating (but no information as to how the fire is fed) and a long time
spent in making ready for the walk—which may well have been
intentionally protracted.
Before passing to further cases the probability should be borne in
mind that when the logs burn at the inner end and drop, the cooler
peripheral stones would tend to roll over the hotter inner stones. It
is these that would be raked to and fro and form the upper layer. If
this does not happen the levelling would bring hotter stones to the
surface in the centre, which several observers have noticed to be the
hottest part, avoided or hurried over by the walkers.
But in the absence of details regarding the fuelling of the pile and
its behaviour during the long hours of heating, speculation about
these points, important as they are, cannot be very fruitful.
Passing on to consider further cases, in one that took place in
1904, witnessed by Mr W. L. Allardyce ^ at Bega Island, Fiji, the pit
was 30 feet in diameter and 3 feet deep, filled with stones and wood
in alternate layers. The fire burned for 12 hours before being
cleared of logs and levelled in the usual way. The heat, he says,
was considerable. A handkerchief laid on the stones (he does not
say ivhere in the pit) was charred. Twelve or fourteen men walked
round and across, taking not more than a minute walking quite
slowly. This pace suggests short quick steps of a foot in half a
second. He examined the feet of the performers and there was, he
felt sure, no preparation applied before and no sign of burning after.
He attributes their immunity to walking barefooted on the very hot
wind-sheltered sunbaked rocks. In this case we have clear indica-
tion, I think, that the stones walked on were not red hot, but the
1 Man, 1904, 45.
138] The Fire Walk 305
important detail of the time taken for the preparation is not
given.
In 1933 Mr Kingsley Roth i
saw the ceremony at the same island
with a smaller pit 15 feet across and 3 feet deep. He tells us the
stones were laid on logs which in his photograph are set radially.
He does not say how long they were left to burn, but there was
definite discomfort 6 feet away. The clearing and levelling only took
20 minutes. From a second photograph the stones seem to have all
collapsed into the pit and are shown covered with logs. The clearing,
he says, goes on until the stones are completely uncovered. A special
log was laid on the top during the clearing and left until the walkers
arrived. This was the path of the Power and no one might cross
between it and the path by which the walkers were to arrive. Con-
tinence was observed beforehand. They walked deliberately over
the stones with a firm tread, gripping them with the feet, and there
was no sign of burning afterwards.
Mr Basil Thomson's ^ experience at Bega is undated. The pit was
19 feet wide and the fire had burned 48 hours. It was, he says, a
white-hot mass shooting out little tongues of flame. The flattening
(and presumably clearing of embers) took half an hour, and tongues
of flame still played among the stones. Then with cries of " Vutu,
Vutu fifteen men rushed out of the grove in pairs, and with appre-
hensive looks stepped on to the stones, led by one Jonathan. But it
is important and instructive to notice that, in this case, planting
their feet firmly and squarely (the best way, incidentally, to distri-
bute the heat over calloused foot-soles), they walked round the pit
and not across it.
A handkerchief was dropped on a large stone from the pit as
Jonathan stepped down, and what remained was picked up as the
last man left. In the 15 or 20 seconds [sic] which elapsed it was
charred where it touched the stone and scorched elsewhere ; clear
evidence that it was not red hot or near it. A more instructive test
would have been to lower and raise a handkerchief on to and off the
stone in time to the steps of one foot of one of the walkers. The fact
that the dried fern anklets of the walkers were not burnt, which Mr
Thomson notes, is not so significant as it would be had they crossed
a diameter of the oven. Mr Thomson is surprised that their insteps
were not burnt, but an instep which touched the ground would be
calloused to some extent, and not as soft as Mr Thomson thinks. He
also noticed the interesting point that their feet were cool after the
walk.
Dr Hocken's ^ account of the stone-walk witnessed at the same
island in 1898 is one of the best known and is interesting for
detailed observations of doubtful accuracy in places, as well as for

unwarranted inferences. The stones were heated from 36 to 48 hours,
the pit was 25 to 30 feet in diameter and 8 feet deep at the deepest,
filled, he says, with white-hot stones. The temperature was 114
degrees on the windward side at the edge. When the pit was pre-
pared—the time taken is not given—the area of stones was only
15 feet across. The walkers were greeted with yells from the crowd
(in most accounts they approach in silence) and marched, as he
thought, leisurely, but others thought quickly, across and around the
stones, leaving where they entered. The leader was just 30 seconds
in it, a rate of 2 feet a second as in Mr Allardyce's case ;
short quick
steps would account for the difference of opinion as to their manner
of walking. ,
Dr Hocken had examined one of the walkers with the leader s
(Jonathan's) permission and satisfied himself by touch, smell and
taste that their legs and feet had not been treated with any applica-
tion. The soles were soft and flexible. He says nothing of the tem-
perature of the feet. The same examination followed the walk.
Jonathan said he felt no heat or other sensation when walking.
" The stones ", Dr Hocken writes, " must have been white hot ",
but not visibly so, owing, he suggests, to the brilliance of the day.
Hypnotism and anaesthersia may produce insensibility, he concludes,
but do not interfere with cautery.
It is clear, I think, that this account is not a very reliable one.
The pit could not have been full of white-hot stones, if they only
covered an area of about half the diameter of the pit after clearing.
The probability also is, for reasons shown above, that the stones were
as they looked, neither white nor red hot on the surface.
Mr Haswell's ^ account refers to a ceremony at Kaiatea in 1885.
The fire burned for a day, the furnace was 30 feet across and 3 to
4 feet deep. The flames poured up between the stones which were
red and white hot. When all was ready and the furnace, he says,
still pouring out its intense heat, the natives marched up and walked
leisurely across, repeating it five times. Here the strategic part of
the performance is dismissed with the words " when all was ready
"
and the general reader would assume that they walked over red and
white-hot stones, blazing logs and all.
I give this account as a good example of bad reporting. Also the
following :
A Boston journalist, Mr Gorten ^ saw the performance at Honolulu,
arranged by Papa Ita, in 1895. All day the fire burned until the
stones were white hot. " Then ", he says (outdoing Mr Haswell)
after reference to incantations and gestures, " the Tahitian calmly
and deliberately walked the length of the pit ". On his return he
stopped in the middle to be photographed. Mr Gorten, however,
after speaking of the fiery path, and white-hot stones, remembers the

preparations, but explains tlieir object in unexpected fashion : in
fact it is something of an anticlimax to read, " The stones were un-
doubtedly hot and were turned by long poles just before walking to
have the hottest side up."
At the end of it we are told that Papa Ita was touring the Islands
in the hands of a manager who, it was rumoured, was going to take
him to the Pan-American Exhibition at Buffalo. With that we take
leave of Papa Ita and Jonathan (who may be the same person),
unless one of them figures anonymously in the last and most sen-
sational case I shall describe, namely that witnessed at Rarotonga
in 1899 by Col. Gudgeon,^ who walked the hot stones with three other
Englishmen barefooted. It is a full account, but I only give the
salient details.
The oven was lit at dawn and his party went to the scene at 2 p.m.,
when things were being got ready and the stones levelled. The
Tohunga and his pupil, after striking the oven in the customary way
with their bunches of ti leaves and muttering spells, walked slowly
and deliberately over the 12 feet of hot stones. The Tohunga then
handed his bunch to Mr Godwin (who owned the site) with the words,
" I hand my ?mna to you : lead your friends across !
" They
started, and " I can only say ", he writes, " we stepped out boldly.
I got across unscathed ;
only one of the party was badly burned, and
he, it is said, was spoken to and looked behind, a thing against the
rules I knew quite well ", he continues, " that Twas walking
over red-hot stones and could feel the heat, yet I was not burned ".
He " felt something like electric shocks then and afterwards for
about 7 hours. ... A man must have niana to do it : if he has not,
it will be too late when he is on the hot stones of Taira-ahi-roa."
Half an hour later the priest threw his green branch on the stones
and in 15 seconds it was blazing. Col. Gudgeon's feet being natur-
ally tender, he walked slowly for fear of tripping. His soles did not
peel and were not hardened. A troupe of 200 Maoris followed, of
whom " many thought they were burnt but none were severely
In this dramatic description several useful details are lacking
:
the rate of walking, the number of steps, the shape of the oven and
its size, whether they walked across the centre or near the edge over
the 12 feet of hot stones, and how long the clearing took. If dawn
is at 5 o'clock the fire had burned only 9 hours, and it is unlikely that
the upper stones would be heated red hot through in that time.
Other accounts also speak of small flames licking up between the
stones, as one might expect, after the large burning logs were with-
drawn. These, with a hot region selected by the Tohunga from
experience, would suffice to parch and ignite the green leaves very
rapidly, and give quite a mistaken idea of the heat of the stones they
had walked on.

308 E. S. Thomas [part
It is clear from his account that CoL Gudgeon was greatly im-
pressed by the scene and elated by his experience. The heat radi-
ating from between the stones gave him the impression that the
stones he trod were of the same heat. If he took 12 steps over the
12 feet distance, stepping 12 inches in half a second, each foot would
have touched the hot stones 6 times for half a second. How hot
were they ? In default of necessary details the presumption must
be that there was nothing abnormal in the immunity of Col. Gudgeon
in his courageous performance.
Clearly the subject cannot be left without considering the great
heat of the furnace both in the ember- and the stone-walk, as distinct
from the temperature and nature of the surface trodden. We are,
I think, justified in assuming the following points, except in the
more trivial examples of the ember-walk :
1 . That there was more or less severe psycho-physical preparation
calculated to train the performer in auto-hypnosis, which would not
only give him faith, but render him more resistant and insensible
than ordinarily to the heat, and as well-known experiments with
hypnotised subjects have shown, even to burning.^ We have
evidence of its actual operation in the self-torture inflicted on them-
selves by Indian walkers, as well as in the test, described by Captain
Hearn, in which the performer passed his fingers to and from a lamp
flame until they were insensible and he felt ready for the ordeal. Col.
Gudgeon was clearly in a state of exaltation which would in some
degree have conduced to the same result.
2. That a bath was taken before the walk which, cooling the limbs,
would contract the blood vessels and reinforce the effect produced
by auto-hypnosis, supplemented in the Asiatic performances by the
excitement into which they worked themselves. ^ The coldness of
the feet after as well as before the walk, reported in two of the cases
from Oceania, is of very great interest, and deserves scientific in-
vestigation. In Mr Haggard's Japanese case alone do we hear of
repeated applications of cold water indoors as distinct from the
bathe. The softening and soaking of the calloused foot-sole by
water would rather be an advantage than otherwise to the walker.
It is highly probable, I think, that Col. Gudgeon would have had a
customary afternoon bathe not long before the walk. As the
Tohunga knew he was going to walk, it is not unlikely that he pre-
scribed it.
3. In some other Indian cases observers have noted the muddy
state of the legs of the walkers, others have referred to the water used
to cool the rakes, or splashed about,^ and others again to small tanks
into which the walkers stepped before walking.
4. In India, at any rate, cases of fakirs and their pupils who inure

tlaeir bodies to the heat of fires as well as to pain are too well known
to need quoting. Walking sun-baked stones in the sheltered island
of Bega may well have inured the soles and legs to heat, as Mr
Allardyce suggests.
The heat endurable by a hardened foot-sole is greater than many
people reahse. We have Mr Langley's instance of natives standing
barefoot on superheated steam pipes. The Editor of Man speaks
''-
of a young acquaintance, a ship's engineer accustomed to walking
barefoot, who could hold a lighted match under his heel until it
burned out, feeling nothing and showing no signs of burning.
As far as the e^ddence goes, then, the quick formation of protective
ash in the ember-walk, and the low conductivity of the basaltic rock
in the stone-walk, the time taken to prepare the oven in both respects,
the effects of exaltation and self-suggestion, strengthened by ascetic
training, in reducing the temperature and increasing the insensi-
bility of the body, aided by cold bathing, and lastly the calloused
foot-soles of the walkers and their short quick steps, seem to relegate
the fire-walk to the class of phenomena whose abnormal element does
not transcend that of cases reported as of ordinary occurrence with
good hypnotic subjects. The cases where the abnormal element
seems strongest suffer evidentially through the omission of im-
portant details, and, apparently, malobservation of a serious kind.
One cannot conclude a study of the fire-walk without reference to
the striking classical examples in fairly recent times of immunity to
fire, namely the experiences of Sir Wilham Crookes and others with
D. D. Home,^ too well known to relate, which seem to rest on such
excellent testimony. But until more crucial evidence of the super-
normal in the fire-walk is forthcoming there is, I think, little justifi-
cation for corroborating the evidence for the supernormal in the
fire-walk by reference to them, and still less their cases by reference
to the fire-walk.

1 am indebted to Father Thurston for drawing my attention to his article
on Human Salamanders in The Month (Feb.-March 1932), in which these and
other cases of similar imnmnity are described in detail. Father Thurston
also describes an ember-walk from Mysore (c. 1922). Great emphasis is laid
on the tremendous heat of the furnace (c. 13 x 16 x 1 ft.) on which several
cartloads of dry jDalm-leaves were thrown, through which people walked
quietly.
A NOTE ON THE RECENT EXPERIMENTS WITH
RUDI SCHNEIDER
By Lord Charles Hope
I HAVE read with much interest the report written by Mr. Th.
Besterman and Mr 0. Gatty on their recent experiments with the
medium Rudi Schneider [Proc. S.P.R., xlii.) and their letter to
Nature, 14th April, 1934.
Having attended a large number of sittings held with this medium
during each of his five visits to London, I feel that a few comments
from me would not come amiss and might be of interest to those
readers of the Proceedings who are interested in the question of the
present position of the Rudi Schneider mediumship. The series of
sittings were all held in London, April 1929 ; Oct. 1929 to Jan. 1930 ;
Feb. 1932 to May 1932 ; Oct. to Dec. 1932 ;
Oct. 1933 to April 1934.
The first three series were held at the National Laboratory of
Psychical Research under the direction of Mr Harry Price,i the
fourth was arranged privately by me and some friends of mine {Proc.
S.P.R., xli.) ; the fifth being his recent visit to the S.P.R.
While in no way wishing to criticise the patient and conscientious
experiments conducted by Messrs. Besterman and Gatty during the
recent sittings with Rudi Schneider, I consider that there are several
points raised by this report and by their letter to Nature (14th April),
which should be elucidated ;
otherwise, I fear, such readers as have
not closely followed the whole case and read the reports issued after
former series of sittings might, inadvertently, be misled as to the sum
total of available evidence for the production of paranormal pheno-
mena by this medium.
Firstly, while it is nowhere stated in the Besterman-Gatty report
that these experiments with infra-red light apparatus disprove the
results reported by Dr Osty (" Les Pouvoirs Inconnus de I'Esprit sur
la Matiere, by E. and M. Osty), or those reported by Mr Herbert
(Proc. S.P.R., xli.), it is possible that some readers might come to
that conclusion.
It should be noted that absorptions of an infra-red light beam
have been reported only at those series of sittings in which the tele-
kinetic phenomena noted have at times been of considerable range

and frequency. In other words, although at sittings when absorp-
tions have been noted there have often been no other phenomena,
yet the two kinds of phenomena have alternated at fairly frequent
intervals and on many occasions both kinds of phenomena have
been reported as happening at the same sitting.
It is true that at only seven out of the seventy-seven sittings, con-
ducted by Dr Osty in 1931, were any telekinetic phenomena noted
(whereas at the majority of the sittings absorptions were observed),
but it must be remembered that Dr Osty, for the greater part of his
experiments, concentrated on trying to obtain absorptions of infra-
red beams rather than telekinetic movement of material objects.
Also, it is worth noting that during the majority of sittings Dr Osty
dispensed with the usual "cabinet ", and so the movement of the
curtains, which is much the most frequent and nearly always the
initial telekinetic phenomenon with this medium, was rendered
impossible.
It would seem to be a significant fact that at both those series of
sittings at which no absorptions were reported (see Th. Besterman's
report, Proc. S.P.R., xl. 428-436, on sittings in Paris, Feb.-March
1933, and the recent S.P.R. sittings, Proc. S.P.R., xlii.), no tele-
kinetic movements of any importance were observed either. This
would seem to show that although it may be, as conjectui'ed by Dr
Osty, usually easier for the medium to effect with his " force " an
absorption of an infra-red beam rather than to move a material
object by telekinetic means, yet when telekinetic movements are
absent from many consecutive sittings there is no reason either to
expect absorptions.
Unfortunately, with the possible exception of some small curtain
movements and some rather indefinite " touches ", no phenomenon
of any kind was reported during the recent series of sittings at the
S.P.R.
In Messrs. Besterman and Gatty's letter to Nature, and also in
their full Report in Proceedings, the point is somewhat stressed that
small curtain movements, such as had already been noted from time
to time, continued after a " check " apparatus had been devised
which registered nothing paranormal. " In order to determine ",
runs this letter, " whether these (movements of curtains) were due
to draughts, a strip of tinfoil about a foot in length was so hung
about 5 mm. from a vertical metal plate that a slight draught
brought them into contact and rang an electric bell. The whole was
so placed that the '
force '
had ready access to it and that draughts
could not affect it. Under these conditions the bell did not ring,
though the curtain continued to move."
It seems to be quite probable that these small curtain movements
were indeed caused by draughts. It was not, however, made clear
in the above letter or, I consider, in the full Report, that the " force ",
312 Lord Charles Bojm [part
to effect the desired contact, would first have had to get behind the
curtains, enter a circular hole of '6"
diameter in the lead box, and
then turn at right-angles and advance about 8" before impinging on
the tinfoil which was only about 4" in width.
It has frequently been noticed at former series of sittings with
Rudi, when really impressive phenomena have occurred, that it has,
almost without exception, been at the sittings at which the pheno-
mena have been both frequent and varied that any degree of deli-
cacy of aim or accomplishment has been achieved by " Olga ". To
move a curtain even violently indicates no very great sense of
direction. To pick up objects, tie knots in handkerchiefs, touch
sitters with the edge of a curtain after a warning to that effect has
been already given by " Olga " and occasionally to place small
objects into or take them away from the hands of sitters, does need
a very considerable accuracy of aim and control of the " force ".
The alternative theory, that when such movements have been
noted they have been achieved by means of the medium freeing a
hand or foot, must of course be duly considered, but those who have
had the experience of controlling this medium while successful sit-
tings have been held are almost unanimous in thinking that theory
untenable owing to the variety and continuity of the phenomena
observed while the controllers were satisfied tlie control of the
medium was perfect.
Although to effect the desired contact in Mr Gatty's above-
mentioned apparatus might have required even less strength than
to move the curtains ever so slightly, yet it would certainly have
needed a much more complicated use of the " force ".
In their letter to Nature, Messrs. Besterman and Gatty say, " It
has been alleged that the trance personality is aware of what goes
on in the dark seance-ioom ; in these sittings this was not found to
be the case." In their full Report [Proc. S.P.R., xlii.) they give
details of unsuccessful attempts made by " Olga " to describe the
position of a sitter's hand. This might be read as constituting a
refutation of the observations made by sitters at previous series of
sittings, whereas in point of fact no such disproof was obtained.
Personally I have always doubted the supposed ability of " Olga
"
to " see " in the dark what the sitters are doing, although I think
" she " has shown, on occasions, a certain hypersensitiveness of
hearing and awareness to any unheralded experiment on the part
of any of the sitters. But it is true that during the more successful
sittings at which I have been present " Olga " has on several
occasions displayed a very accurate idea of where such objects as
have been seen or heard by the sitters to move during the sitting
would be found when the white light was turned on at the end.
The red light used at the sittings was usually too faint and too
restricted in its area of illumination to explain how this could have
138] Note on Recent Experiments with Rudi Schneider 313
been achieved by " Olga ", but a careful record of " Olga's
"
successes and failui-es in that dii-ection would have to be kept over
a long series of successful sittings before any conclusion could be
come to. The experiment done in conjunction with Dr C. G.
Douglas of Oxford, described in the Report and also in the letter to
Nature, in connection with the fast trance breathing hitherto so
much conimented on, is of great interest. If this single experiment
can be relied on, and no doubt it was carried out with care, and we
are assured the breathing of the medium while undergoing the tests
was typical of his trance breathing during ordinary sittings, then it
would certainly seem to disprove the result of Dr Osty's experiment
(" Les Pouvoirs Inconnus de I'Esprit sur la Matiere, p. 117) done by
means of external measurements of the medium's chest while the
trance breathing was in progress. Dr Osty's experiment had seemed
to show that the volume of air breathed by the medium in trance
was greatly above the normal.
The medium's brother, Willi Schneider, also a noted medium,
when he was in a similar trance state, is said to have breathed in
almost as rapid a manner as Rudi. This rapid breathing of the
Schneider brothers has been held to be unique among physical
mediums, and the discovery that Rudi after all only inhales about a
normal amount of air into his lungs, brings their case more into line
with other impressive cases of physical mediumship, and supports
the theory that the fast breathing is an acquired habit and is not
really necessary for the production of paranormal phenomena.
Both authors of the Report claim to have duplicated Rudi's fast
breathing for considerable periods of time. I myself heard Mr
Gatty do a successful imitation of Rudi's trance breathing for over
half an hour at a time during a sitting ; an excellent method of
comparison although one, perhaps, unlilcely to appeal to " Olga's
"
sense of uniqueness.
The result of the word-association and psychogalvanic reflex tests
with_ Rudi and " Olga " is of great interest and will strengthen the
opinion of those observers of the mediumship (and they form a
majority) who had already come to the conclusion that " Olga " is
a secondary personality of the medium's. It is indeed unfortunate
that so much careful work and such a large financial outlav should
have gone unrewarded by conclusive results as to the chief pheno-
mena associated with this mediumship, and disappointing to all
concerned that Messrs. Besterman and Gatty, after all their trouble,
should not have had an opportunity of judging of the value of the
phenomena in question such as a single good sitting would have
given them.
At the end of March 1934, thinking it would be of considerable
interest from a psychological point of view if the medium were asked
to sit in a room in which he had previously produced impressive
314 Lord Charles Hope [part
phenomena (in 1929 and in Nov.-Dec. 1932), and to restrict the ,
sitters as much as possible to those in whose presence he had given ,
really successful sittings, I invited Rudi to stay on in London for an
|
extra fortnight after completing his visit to the S.P.R. As pheno- ,
mena were observed at the second and third of these extra sittings,
he eventually remained for three weeks, and gave in all seven
sittings from April 4th to 20th. No apparatus to detect the presence
of the " force " was employed, as there was not sufficient time m
which to arrange this, and in any case the medium appears to think ,
that when his " force " is weak the use of such apparatus tends to
|
inhibit his powers. . .
Owing to illness I was myself only able to attend the first sittmg,
which was a blank. Fortunately, however, among the sitters who
attended most of these sittings were Professor A. F. C. Pollard,
Professor D. F. Fraser-Harris, Mr C. C. L. Gregory and Captam the
Hon. Victor Cochrane-Baillie, all of whom had had considerable \
experience with the medium during at least two of his former
successful series of sittings, and the last named had also attended
a large number of the S.P.R. series of sittings.
|
Out of the seven sittings held, four at least were positive (at a
fifth one sitter thought there had been a small movement of the
curtain, but this was not corroborated by the other sitters and there-
j
fore was discounted). The phenomena observed consisted chiefly i
of movements of the cabinet curtain, which was not hung with such
delicate adjustment as those at the S.P.R. had been, and therefore
required more " force " to move them. While these movements
were at no time as large as have been reported at former sittings,
they were large enough on occasions to be seen by all the sitters and
the small bells attached to one curtain were fairly frequently heard
to ring.
The sixth sitting was the best, and the movements of the curtains
were quite frequent and considerable. Mr Gregory was asked by
" Olga " to hold a waste-paper basket near to the centre of the two
curtains. Accordingly, keeping contact with his neighbours, he
balanced the basket on his hands. He felt several tugs on the end
of the basket nearest to the curtains and eventually it was pulled off
his hand on to the floor.
A technique, new as far as I know, was developed by " Olga " at
these sittings. At the first sitting I was asked to hold the centre edge
of the curtain nearest to the medium. I was subsequently asked by
" Olga " if I could feel " her " puUing at it. I did not feel anything,
but at later sittings Professor Fraser-Harris, Mr Gregory and Mr
C. W. Fisk all had the experience of feehng the curtain tugged and
when held somewhat lightly it was several times pulled out of the
sitter's hand.
While in no way equal in variety or strength to the phenomena
138] Note on Recent Experiments with Rudi Schneider 315
displayed at earlier sittings in 1929 and 1932, the result of these
extra sittings tend to show that Rudi Schneider has not lost his
power of producing paranormal phenomena, and it is to be hoped
that either in Austria or elsewhere it will be found possible to con-
tinue to experiment with him and see if the reported absorptions of
infra-red light beams can be repeated and more closely examined
and the production of telekinetic phenomena proved to the satis-
faction of all.
A Comment on the above Note by Mr Oliver Gatty
I HAVE read with great interest Lord Charles Hope's " Note on the
recent experiments with Rudi Schneider," and am very grateful to
him for elucidating a number of potential misunderstandings.
The report on the recent investigations of Rudi Schneider at the
Society for Psychical Research was confined almost exclusively to
facts observed during those sittings, both for the sake of brevity
and in the interest of impartiality. If this has led to any misunder-
standings, I should like to apologise.
Lord Charles Hope raises the question as to the accuracy of the
single experiment carried out on the respiration of the medium in
trance. Four samples were taken and also one of the medium in a
normal resting state. All five sets gave figures of substantially the
same order of magnitude, and this may be said to be a sort of check
on the figures. Further, the values for the respiratory coefficient
depend only on the composition and not on the bulk of the exhaled
gases. Thus the possibility of error due to leakage of the valves at
high speeds is not likely seriously to affect the conclusions drawn
(see Proc. S.P.R., xlii. p. 261) from the data. The method of
measuring total exhaled gases in a Douglas bag is superior to
measurements of chest expansion (used by Dr Osty), since it also
includes the respiration due to movements of the diaphragm. It
therefore seems safe to conclude that there is nothing necessarily
paranormal in the breathing of the medium, as it was also found
possible to reproduce it at will.
REVIEW
The Case for Faith-Healing, by J. D. Beresford. With a Preface
by tbe Very Reverend H. R. L. Slieppard. London : G-eorge
Allen and Unwin. Pp. 186. Price 5s. net.
The case for faith-healing can be made incontrovertible if care be
taken to indicate quite clearly the kinds of illness than can be cured
by faith. It may be necessary to say what we mean by faith, what
we mean by illness and what we mean by cm-e, but in the everyday
meaning of these words it may be readily admitted that many con-
ditions which are obvious departures from health may be relieved
if the sick person has a deep-seated conviction, however achieved,
that such relief will take place. The truth of this is most apparent
when we are dealing with those forms of illness which are sometimes
referred to as functional nervous disorders. When, however, we
have to deal with illness due to or accompanied by gross organic
changes the effects of faith as a healing agent are much more obscure.
We are not justified in denying that physical changes may gradually
be brought about by mental influences, but all our knowledge of the
physical universe makes us sceptical when we are told that gross
physical changes, such as the lengthening of a bone, may take place
instantaneously as a result of faith.
Yet it is faith-healing of this kind which Mr. Beresford defends
in this book, and it is because he accepts as already proven cures of
this kind that his work is of little interest to men of science. For
example, he says :
" I have good authority for the instantaneous
healing in February this year of a boy, with a retracted Achilles
tendon and a malformation of the foot, due to infantile paralysis at
the age of nineteen months." Yet he very rightly adds :
" We can
imagine a malignant growth changing its nature, dying out and be-
coming finally absorbed by healthy tissue. In such cases we can
postulate a conceivable process that does not too greatly shock our
sense of causation. But there is no conceivable natural process
known to us that will account for the instantaneous creation of
material necessary to lengthen the muscles, tendons and, in all pro-
bability, bone of that child's leg by nearly two inches." Neverthe-
less he believes in the truth of this story, for which he says he has good
authority, and he believes in the miracles of Lourdes
—" cures
vouched for by medical and ecclesiastical authority ". Being con-
316
PART 138j Revieiv 317
vinced he says :
" I . . . am now content to try and find some more
or less rational justification for the facts, rather than to spend my
energies in obstinate and unreasoning denial."
The aim of his book is the somewhat ambitious one of framing " a
cosmology that would admit the possibility of miracles ". He seeks
a rational justification of the facts, although he realises that there is
no conceivable natural process known to us that will account for
them. For the production of miracles of healing he does not invoke
any external power. The power that acts in faith-healing is a power
within the self, and it is merely because we do not know all the laws
of nature that we regard '
miracles '
as a contravention of natural
law. This power is attributed to a deeply hidden element of the self
which is " able to influence the rhythm of the organism, even to
upset and rebuild the arrangement of the body cells ".
Mr Beresford's conception of the nature of this element of the self
is not easily grasped, and in some ways his different accounts of it
seem contradictory. He begins by insisting that man is not a single
but a multiple personality. He takes up the point of view adopted
by Professor McDougall in his presidential address to our society and
maintains that " the thinldng '
I '
of Descartes is the indiiferently
capable leader of a mixed and at times unmanageable team of other
'I's ', some of which may remain throughout life beyond the reach
of our conscious understanding ". He records that he came under
the influence of Myers' teaching on the subliminal self and he quotes
a passage from Maeterlinck about the " Unknown Guest ". He gets
the impression from both these writers that the subconscious self is
a separate entity, and he repudiates this suggestion of duality
although he admits that " man is not a single but a multiple per-
sonality ". In the end he says there is no such separate entity as a
subconscious self and no separated strata or levels of consciousness.
Rather is he inclined to assume that consciousness is present in every
ceU of the body ; and the totality of consciousness is the sum of the
consciousnesses of all the individual cells. Any group of cells that,
as it were, think alike create a small superconsciousness within the
confederation that we know as the personality ; and to bring about
any faith-cure of the kind that works apparent miracles, every
element of the consciousness must be temporarily in harmony. To
bring this about there must be "a complete submission of the
intellect and critical judgment ". Only thus can the integration of
the personality necessary for faith-healing be achieved.
But, even with such complete integration of the personality as is
implied in the " thinking alike " of all the individual cells, we have
no grounds for supposing that such integration carries with it the
power to work miracles of healing. Behind the psychological
changes underlying integration of the whole personality Mr Beres-
ford is forced to postulate some spiritual immortal principle in man,
318 Review [part 138
which is developed by persistent effort through many incarnations
and is related to that universal spirit which is the source of all life.
" AD matter is a temporal spatial expression of spirit ", and " this
book is addressed without prejudice to all those who, however for-
mally, subscribe to the idealistic account of the universe ".
