REACTION OF SPIRITUALISM .
W h a t I have said of the Protestant world cannot
be applied to the present century without some
important qualifications. Properly speaking, Pro­
testantism finished its work and expired in the
French Revolution at the close of the last century.
Since then there has been a reaction in favor of
Spiritualism.
Men incline to exclusive Spiritualism in propor­
tion to their want of faith in the practicability of
improving their earthly condition. This accounts
for the predominance of Spiritualism in the Church.
The Church grew up and constituted itself amidst
the crash of a falling world, when all it knew or
could conceive of material well-being was crumb­
ling in ruins around it. Greece and Rome were
the prey of merciless barbarians. Society was
apparently annihilated. Order there was none.—
Security for person, property, or life, seemed
almost the extravagant vagary of some mad enthu-

siast. Lawless violence, brutal passion, besotting
ignorance, tyrants and their victims, were the only
spectacles presented to win men’s regard for the
earth, or to inspire them with faith and hope to
labor for. its improvement. To the generation of
that day, when the North disgorged itself upon the
South, the earth must have appeared forsaken by its
Maker, and abandoned to the Devil and his minis­
ters. It was a wretched land; it could yield no
supply; and the only solace for the soul was to turn
away from it to another and a better world, to the
world of spirit; to that world where tyrants do not
enter, where wrongs and oppression, sufferings and
grief, find no admission; where mutations and
insecurity are unknown, and where the poor earth-
wanderer, the time-worn pilgrim, may at length
find that repose, that fulness of joy which he craved,
which he sought but found not below. This view
was natural, it was inevitable; and it could lead
only to exclusive spiritualism — mysticism.
But when the external world has been somewhat
meliorated, and men find that they have some secu­
rity for their persons and property, that they may
count with some degree of certainty on to-morrow,
faith in the material order is produced and con­
firmed. One improvement prepares another* —

Success inspires confidence in future efforts. And
this was the case at the epoch of the Reformation.
Men had already made great progress in the mate­
rial order, in their temporal weal. Their faith in it
kept pace with their progress, or more properly,
outran it. It continued to extend till it became
almost entire and universal. The Eighteenth
Century will be marked in the annals of the world
for its strong faith in the material order. Melio­
rations on the broadest scale were contemplated
and viewed as already realized. Our Republic
sprang into being, and the world leaped with joy
that “ a man child was born.” Social progress and
the perfection of governments became the religious
creed of the day; the weal of man on earth, the
spring and aim of all hopes and labors. A new
paradise was imaged forth for man, inaccessible to
the serpent, more delightful than that which Adam
lost, and more attractive than that which the pious
Christian hopes to gain. We of this generation can
form only a faint conception of the strong faith our
fathers had in the progress of society, the high
hopes of human improvement they indulged, and
the joy too big for utterance, with which they
heard France in loud and kindling tones proclaim
Liberty and Equality. France for a moment

became the centre of the world. All eyes were
fixed on her movements. The pulse stood still
when she and her enemies met, and loud cheers
burst from the universal heart of Humanity when
her tri-colored flag was seen to wave in triumph
over the battle field. There was then no stray
thought for God and eternity. Man and the world
filled the soul. They were too big for it. But
while the voice of Hope was yet ringing, and
T e D e u m shaking the arches of the old Cathedrals,
— the Convention, the reign of Terror, the exile
of patriots, the massacre of the gifted, the beau­
tiful and the good, Napoleon and the Military Des­
potism came, and Humanity uttered a piercing
shriek, and fell prostrate on the grave of her
hopes !
The reaction produced by the catastrophe of this
memorable drama was tremendous. There are
still lingering among us those who have not for­
gotten the recoil they experienced when they saw
the Republic swallowed up, or preparing to be
swallowed up, in the Empire. Men never feel
what they felt but once. The pang which darts
through their souls changes them into stone. —
From that moment enthusiasm died, hope in social
melioration ceased to be indulged, and those who

had been the most sanguine in their anticipations,
hung down their heads and said nothing; the
warmest friends of Humanity apologized for their
dreams of Liberty and Equality; Democracy be­
came an accusation, and faith in the perfectibility
of mankind a proof of disordered intellect.
In consequence of this reaction, men again
despaired of the earth; and when they despair of
the earth, they always take refuge in heaven; when
man fails them, they always fly to God. They had
trusted materialism too far — they would now not
trust it at all. They had hoped too much — they
would now hope nothing. The future, which had
been to them so bright and promising, was now
overspread with black clouds; the ocean on which
they were anxious to embark was lashed into rage
by the storm, and presented only images of dis­
masted or sinking ships and drowning crews.—
They turned back and sighed for the serene past,
the quiet and order of old limes, for the mystic
land of India, where the soul may dissolve in ecstasy
and dream of no change.
At the very moment when the sigh had just
escaped, that mystic land reappeared. The Eng­
lish, through the East India Company, had brought
to light its old Literature and Philosophy, so diverse

from the Literature and Philosophy of modern Eu­
rope or of classical antiquity, and men were capti­
vated by their novelty and bewildered by their
strangeness. Sir William Jones gave currency to
them by his poetical paraphrases and imitations;
and the Asiatic Society by its researches placed
them within reach of the learned of Europe. The
Church rejoiced, for it was like bringing back
her long lost mother, whose features she had
remembered and was able at once to recognise. —
Germany, England, and even France became Ori­
ental. Cicero, and Horace, and Virgil, iEschylus,
Euripides, and even Homer, with Jupiter, Apollo
and Minerva were forced to bow before Hindoo
Bards and Gods of uncouth forms and unutterable
names.
The influence of the old Braminical or spiritual
world, thus dug up from the grave of centuries, may
be traced in all our Philosophy, Art and Literature.
It is remarkable in our poets. It moulds the form
in Byron, penetrates to the ground in Wordsworth,
and entirely predominates in the Schlegels. It
causes us to feel a new interest in those writers and
those epochs which paftake the most of Spiritualism.
Those old Epglish writers who were somewhat in­
clined to mysticism are revived; Plato, who travelled

in the East and brought back its lore which he
modified by Western genius and moulded into
Grecian forms, is reedited, commented on, trans­
lated and raised to the highest rank among phi­
losophers. The middle ages are reexamined and
found to contain a treasure of romance, acuteness,
depth and wisdom, and are deemed by some to be
“ dark ages0 only because we have not light
enough to read them.
Materialism in Philosophy is extinct in Germany.
It is only a reminiscence in France, and it produces
no remarkable work in England or America.
Phrenology, which some deem Materialism, has
itself struck Materialism with death in Gall’s Work,
by showing that we are conscious of phenomena
within us which no metaphysical alchemy can
transmute into sensations.
Protestantism, since the commencement of the
present century, in what it has peculiar to itself,
has ceased to gain ground. Rationalism in Ger­
many retreats before the Evangelical party; the
Genevan Church makes few proselytes; English and
American Unitarianism, on the plan of Priestley and
Belsham, avowedly material, and being, as it were,
the jumping-off place from the Church to absolute
infidelity, is evidently on the decline. There is

probably not a man in this country, however much
and justly he may esteem Priestley and Belsham,
as bold and untiring advocates of reason and of
Humanity, who would be willing to assume the
defence of all their opinions. On the other hand
Catholicism has revived, offered some able apolo­
gies for itself, made some eminent proselytes and
alarmed many Protestants, even among ourselves.
Indeed every where is seen a decided tendency
to Spiritualism. The age has become weary of
uncertainty. It sighs for repose. Controversy is
nearly ended, and a sentiment is extensively pre­
vailing, that it is a matter of very little consequence
what a man believes, or what formulas of worship
he adopts, if he only have a right spirit. Men,
who a few years ago were staunch Rationalists,
now talk of Spiritual Communion ; and many, who
could with difficulty be made to admit the inspira­
tion of the Bible, are now ready to admit the
inspiration of the sacred books of all nations; and
instead of stumbling at the idea of God’s speaking
to a few individuals, they see no reason why he
should not speak to every body. Some are becom­
ing so spiritual that they see no necessity of matter;
others so refine matter that it can offer no resist­
ance to the will, making it indeed move as the spirit

listeth; others still believe that all wisdom was in
the keeping of the priests of ancient India, Egypt,
and Persia, and fancy the world has been deteriorat­
ing for four thousand years, instead of advancing.
Men go out from our midst to Europe, and come
back half Catholics, sighing to introduce the
architecture, the superstition, the rites and the
sacred symbols of the middle ages.
A universal cry is raised against the frigid utili­
tarianism of the last century. Money-getting,
desire for worldly wealth and renown, are spoken of
with contempt, and men are evidently leaving the
Outward for the Inward, and craving something
more fervent, living and soul-kindling. All this
proves that we have changed from what we were;
that, though Materialism yet predominates and
appears to have lost none of its influence, it is be­
coming a tradition; and that there is a new force
collecting to expel it. Protestantism passes into
the condition of a reminiscence. Protestant
America cannot be aroused against the Catholics.
A mob may burn a convent from momentary ex­
citement, but the most protestant of the Protestants
among us will petition the Legislature to indemni­
fy the owners. Indeed Protestantism died in the
French Revolution, and we are beginning to be-

come disgusted with its dead body. The East
has reappeared, and Spiritualism revives; will it
again become supreme ? Impossible.
