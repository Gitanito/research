Dreams.
^ ABUSE,
To dream that you are abused and insulted, is
a certain sign that some dispute will happen be-
tween you and some person with whom you have
business ; therefore, alter such a dream, you
should be particularly careful of yourself and be
as gentle and mild as possible, that you may not
give those with whom you have dealings any ad-
vantage over you if you areinlove, be assured
that some one has atteoipted to injure you with
the object of ) our alTectious, and that they have
in a great measure succeedefi you should, there-
fore, after such a dream, be particularly com-
plaisant and atteutire ; by this means you will
eradicate the unfavorable impressions that have
been made against you if you have a law-suit,
keep a sharp look out alter your attorney, for
such a dream in that case denotes, that he is en-
deavouring to sell your cau&e avoid, after such
a dream, taking a journey by land, or a voyage
by Fea, for eight and forty hours, because such a
dream forebodes accidents by travelling.
To dream of the commission of this sin, fore-
bodes great troubles and misfortunes if you are
in lore, you will certainly fail in marrying the
object of your wishes if you have a law-Riit, it
will certainly go against you, by the treachery of
those who prettnd to be your frie:sds if you are
in business some hea\y Iofs will happen to yoU.
Such a dream announces that you are in great
danger of losing your liberty and if you are
about to take a voyage by Fea, omit it for the
present, for you will never reach the destined
port. To dre-^m you were tempted to commit
tins crime, and that you resisted
it,
is
an happy
omen every thing will flourish with you- be
sure
it
is
a
good time to begin trade after such
a
dream
if
you have
a
law-suit all will go in your
favor, with credit to yourself and confusion to
your opponents
if
you are about to take
a
long
journey,
it
will be pleasant and successful to your
object
if
you are going to sea, you will have an
agreeable voyage, fine weather, ?.nd
a
quick ar-
rival at the port of destination
if
you are ii>
love, press the object of your wishes for they will
be gratified.
ABEL.
To dream of this second son of Adam, the
victim of his brother's vengeance and jealousy,
and the first man that stained the eatrh with his
blood, is a favorable omen, portends future ele-
vation and ^r indeur if you have a \3i^^ -suit, it
will terminate in your favor if you are in love,
the mistress of your heart will be kind and faith-
ful if you are about to commence trade, your
business will thrive, and you will become rich
if you are a farmer, be sure of good crops the
ensuing season ^if you are about to undertake a
journey, it will be prosperous to you ; in short,
expect to rise to honours, dignity, and aifluence^
observe one thing, that should he speak to you
in your dream, you should be very careful to
mind what he says, as otherwise you may mar
all ypur good fortune, and reverse every benefit
that fortune has in store for you,
ABRAHAM*
To dream of this patriarch is favorable to
the person who dreams ; it in general denotes
accumulation of riches and of honours; in a
woman, it denotes, that she will have many
children; if you are in love, it denotes you will
have many rivals; if you have a law-suit,
it.
forebodes that many difficulties will occur
if
you are in business, then
it
portends
a
great in-
crease of your business, and that you will ertiploy
many hands to conduct
it
;
you must also be
very observant of what he says to you, for he
will perhaps inform you how to avoid some mis^
fortune, or how to attain to riches and honors,

'
ADAM.
To dream you see this fatlier cf maa, this ia-
habitant of Paradise, who was betrayed by Eve
into sin, is an happy omeo ; if he looks pleasant
be sure you will succeed in whatever you under-
take ^ifyou are in love, expect your mistress to
smile on your Icve, and to reward your con^
stancy ifyou have a law-suit, expect it to be
given mucii in your favor by the judj>;e if you
are a farmer, expect an abundant crop, and
that your pigs, poultry, and cattle, will increase
very fast, and be of a good kind, and fetch the
best price at market if you are about fo quit
jour native place, abandon the idea, for depend
gome benefit is in store for you in the place
where you had birth if you have already quit-
ted
it,
I
would advise you, ifyou can, to return,
for there lies your forume and prosperity
;
do
not undertake journies unless absohitely neces-
sary, for although they will be successful, yet
you will still be more fortunate
by
resting at
home
if
he looks displeased and angry, then
you must use ^reat caution
in
all your dealings,
for some mischief
is
intended you, but you will
get the better of
it
;
but on no account under-
take
a
voyas:e by sea, neither borrow nor lend
moGey, for at least
a
month or two, because,
if
you do, you will lose what you lend and what
you borrow will bring you into trouble
;
be care-
ful,
if
he speaks to you, to mind what he says,
and observe
it
as faithfully as you possibly can.
ADVERSARY.
To dream you meet witJi an adversary de-
notes that you will overcome some obstacle to
your happiness
if
you are
a
lover, you will
conquer some powerful rival, and be happy in
your love; it also denotes, that your affairs are
going on well if }
ou arc soliciting? a place, it
portends you are about to get it ; if you are in
trade, it forebodes sendee good orders, and an
increase of business ; if you quarrel, and he over-
comes you, it is a good sign, for you will con-
quer all obstacles to your promotion, happiness,
and fortune; but if you conquer him, then it
denotes that you will never rise to any great pre-
ferment by the means you are at present
adopting ; that many things will miscarry with
you, but in general you will be fortunate
should he draw b!3od of you, you will surely
lose your liberty for a time, but will afterwards
be flourishing and happy.
ACaUAINTANCE.
To dream you quarrel or fight with an ac-
quaintance is an unlucky omen; it forebodes a
divisioQ among your own family, much to the
injury and prejudice of the dreamer if you are
in love, your mistress will prove unfaithful, and
marry some other man that she has told you she
most hates if you are in business, some heavy
loss will befall you; you will disagree with some
of your best friends on the most trivial matters,
which will end in an open rupture; if you are a
farmer, expect a bad crop, the murrain among
your cattle : that your pigs and poultry will
fail, and not fetch good prices if you have a
law-suit, depend, that your attorney will neglect
you, that your witnesses will be tardy and back-
ward, and that finally you will lose your cause.
Do not for some time undertake a journey by
land, or a voyage by sea : enter for the present
into no new urKleriakiag, for you will be uu»
sncccsgfiil ; quit, if you can, your present plac^
8
of residence ; and above all, avoid lendino: mo-
ney, for you will surely lose
it,
together with
the friendship of those to whom you lend it.
AGUE.
To dream you have an ague, denotes nothing
very particular, more than you are in danger of
becoming
a
drunkard and
a
glutton. If you
have any relation or friend that
h
ill,
it
denotes
they will recover. And
if
you have
a
law-suit,
that
it
will be settled in your favor. If you are
in love,
it
forewarns you, that
if
you do not
immediately marry you will lose your n^istress.
Ifyou dream another has an ague, then
it
de-
notes
a
variety of fortune, that you will some-
times be rich, and sometimes poor; that you
trill have much trouble, lose your liberty, and
die before you are fifty. To dream your sweet-
heart has an ague,
is
a
lucky omen,
it
shews
you are beloved, and that you w ill be happy with
the object of your wishes, but never very rich.
AIR.
To dream of the atmosphere, has
a
variety of
interpretations, and depends entirely on the dif-
ferent appearances
it
has. If you dream the sky
is
clear, of
a
fine blue, calm and serene, then
it
is
a
good omen
;
you will be successful in your
enterprises;
if
you are soliciting any place or
preferment, you will surely obtain
it
-if you
are in love, you will surely marry the object of
your afiections have you
a
law^-suit
?
you will
gain
it
are you
in
trade
?
it
will flourish and
be profitable are you
a
farmer? good crops
will attend you, your cattle will increase, your
pigs and poultry will be abundant, your com-
niodiiieswill fetch
a
good price at market; are
you married? yen will have many children,
and they Tvill be dutiful and do well. Are you
about to undertake a journey ? it will answer
your utmost expectations ; are you ^oino^ to
sea ? you will have a pleasant and piosperous
voyage; are you in debt? you will speedily be
enabled to extricate yourself from it ; are you
inpri^07l? you will shortly be set at liberty;
are you going into business ? you will succeed,
and have nu^ny friends; are you in poverty ?
riches will quickly drive away its remembrance ;
have you a quarrel ? it will soon be made up to
your advantage; in short, whatever point you
aim at, it will be crowned with success.
To dream it is streaked with white, denotes
that many severe difficulties will befall you,
over which you will eventually triumph ; you
will perhaps go to jail, but you will come out
again shortly with honor and credit to yourself;
it forbodes that many enemies will attack you
both openly and secretly, that they will appear
to have the advantage over you for a time, but
in the end they will be routed and overcome by
you ; your children will get into troubles, out
of which you will extricate them ; if you are in
love, many crosses will happen to you, and for
a time you will appear to lose the affections of
your sweetheart, but in the end you will marry
and be happy, and have fin children; if you
have a law^-suit, you will have much trouble and
vexation, but you will gain it after all ; if you
are in business, many difficulties will occur,
which friends will remove, and you will at last
be prosperous ; if you go to sea, you w ill be
cast away, but get safe ashore, and be fa-
vorably received by the inhabitants of the coun-
try; if you borrow money, you will be much
slandered and abused by the person who lends
10
it to you; if you lend money, you will have
great trouble in recovering it ; it portends, that
you will have a light illness, but your health,
will be much better afterwards, |
To dream that it is full of thick, dark, and
'
heavy clouds, is an unfavorable token; you will
fall sick and perhaps die; dis^^appointments will
attend your business ; if you are in love, you
will not marry the person you intended ; if you
have a law-suit jou will lose it; if you go to sea
you will have bad weather, meet with storms
and shipwreck, and lose all your, property ; you
will lose some friend, or near relation by death;
many friends will desert you ; yqu will grow
melancholy, and every thing will cross your ex-
pectations; therefore, after such a dream you
should change your situation, be what it may.
To dream that the sky is streaked with red,
and looks fiery, denotes, that in love you will
be successful ; in business not so; it biso fore-
w^arns you that some friend or relation will be
killed in battle, and that sickness will attend
your family; ifyou have a son he will get into
many difficulties, and narrowly escape losing
his life; a journey by land will injure your
health and pocket, but a voyage by sea will be
prosperous, and conducive to your health if
you are in prison, you will remain there some-
time if you owe ^ny money, I advise you to
pay it immediateljr, otherwise it will bring you
into trouble whatever you lend you will loose;
but if you have any hopes of getting a place,
you will, after some trouble, succeed, and it
will turn out lucrative it also dei otes that the
Dext woman you meet, not of your own fami-
ly, will be your enerpy and endeaypuv to cjo
11
^oU an injury ; this you may prevent by being
very civil and obliging to her, which will allay
her resentments against you if you are a farm-
er you will have but indifferent crops, and will
lose some of your horses by sickness or acci-
dent if your father and you are at variance,
depend it will be speedily made up, and that he
will befriend you; but be very cautious of
quarrelling, for you will have the worst of it
you will get some small matter by legacy, but
it will not do you much good.
ALTAR.
To dream you are at the altar and receiving the
holy sacrament, is a very unfavourable omen
and denotes many heavy and severe afflictions,
and that you will be very unsuccessful in your
pursuits, and have much trouble in overcoming
your difficulties. If you are in love, your sweet-
heart will die before you marry, or else be re-
moved very far from you forever if you are in
business, heavy losses will attend you, and you
will with great difficulty keep from going to pri-
son you will lose m«ny friends by death sick-
ness will come upon you and your family, and
your children will be undutiful and turn out bad.
ANCHOR.
To dream of this emblem of hope, denotes
some good to the dreamer ; it forebodes many
unexpected successes. If you are in love, it
irarns you to be assi^luous and attentive to obtain
the object of your wishes, otherwise your passion
will cot meet with success if you are in trade,
then it forebodes success at a distant prriod, after
you had n^^arly given over all expectation of do-
ing well ; expect shortly to see some friend who
has been at sea, and that he has escaped some
12
perilous situation it forebodes, that lawsuits will
attend you, in which you will not gain much, al-
though you will not be much injured by tliem
beware of gome friend who pretends you more
than ordinary attachment, he ivill deceive you,
and endeavour though vainly to harm you; yoaj
will have many children, chiefly girls, and the
third bora will be the best ofF in this world*
ANGELS.
To dream you see angels in your sleep^isa^
sure sign that some one is near you therefore be
mindful of the rest of your dream, for it will
csme to pass pretty accurately ; should you only
dream you see nothing but an angel, or angels,
then it denotes health, prosperity, and much hap-
pi^sess, with many children, who will all turn out
good. If a woman with child dreams ofthem,
she will have a good time and perhaps twins \{
you are in love, nothing can be more favourable,
and ail your undertakings will prosper, and be
advantageous to you,
ANGER.
To dream that you are in a passion and angry
with any one, denotes you have many enemies,
and that some evil design is formed against your
happiness and security ifyou arein love, be sure
that some dangerous rival is slandering you to
your sweetheart if you are at law with any one,
depend that secret attempts are making to sell
your cau&e ; if you are in business look carefu'ly
after your servants, for you are forewarned that
they are about to plunder you, and do you an in-
jury ; be careful whom you trust, for some swind-
ler will attempt to defraud you, and without great
care on your part will be successful. Tf you are
going a journey, avoid travelling by night or aloiie
13
iQ bye places; for such a dream denotes, you Avill
be robbed and ill treated if you dream you see
another in a passion uith you, it is rather more
favorable, but still forebodes some very unpleasant
misfortunes about to happen to you ; if you are
in love, your s^veetheart will fall sick and expe-
rience some heavy loss. If ycu are in business
some creditors v;ill become very troublesome to
you, and perhaps arrest you ; if you have a law-
suit, you -will find great difficulty in getting money
to carry it on ; if you are going to sea, storms
will arise, and you will have a very dangerous
passage ; if you journey by land, you will fall
sick en the road and be unsuccessful in what you
are about.
ANTS.
To dream of these industrious little insects,
hath a variety of interpretations, and depends up-
on the manner in which you dream of them ; if
you see them running about, it denotes that you
Will be a great loser by some plan that you will
undertake for gain, and that you will be consid-
erably the sufferer by an avaricious disposition ;
if you are ia love, too geat a regard to the dower
of your intended wife will breakoif the match ; if
you are going to sea with mx^rchand'ze, you will
be taken in when you most expect to make a good
bargain. If you have a lawsuit, you will lose
it,
although circumstances may appear much in your
favour. In short, some speculation by which you
expect to make much money, will go very near to
ruin you. If you dream you see them busily em-
ployed laying in their winter stores,
it
is
a
good
omen things will prosper with you
;
if
you un-
dertake
a
journey,
it
will turn out well
;
if
you are
in love, your love v,
ill
be crowned with success
;
14
if you are in business, your affairs mil prospesv
and you will grow rich, get many friends, and ar-
rive at considerable honors in the state ; if you
are a farmer, plentiful crops of corn will gild
your fields ; your hay harvest will be abundant ;
your cattle will multiply; your sows will have
large litters ; your hens will hatch many chickens |
your poultry in general will incrrase very fast
and yo.ur commodities will fetch the best price at
market. If you go to sea, you will get money
by it; if you are married, you will have an aff^c-
tionate wife and many children, with am-
ple means of supporting them ; in short, your
concerns will prosper, and you will be very
happy. If they appear to be devoured by other
animals, and oiherwise injured and trodden
upon, then it is a bad omen; secret enemies^
are compassing your ruin ; some bosom friend
will deceive you ; your sweetheart will be un-
kind and perhaps unfaithful ; your business will
be unproductive, bad crops will attend your cul-
tivation, and your commodities will not fetch a
good price at market. If you go to sea, misfor-
tunes will attend your voyage ; if you have a law-
suit, you w ill surely lose it by tl^e perfidy of
some pretended friend ; if you journey by lend,
you will be attacked by robbers, and robbed of
whatever you have 5
if they are entirely destroy-
ed, you will get into prison, your busines will
fail ; if ycu are in love, your sweetheart wil! not
reward your passion; if you are a faroier, your
cattle will die of the murrain, and your cropr. he
unproductive; if you go to sea, you wiii be cast
away sod lose your all; if you expect a place
you will be disappointed ; and if you are in a
good phcc, yon ivili kiuely lose it ; sickness will
15
attack you, your thread of life will be cut shorty
yourchilclreD will die, and your wife become un-
faithful 5
in short, the most dibmal reverse will
happen to you, and disaster attend all your
attempts ; if you dream of these insects when you
are sick, you must expect to recover very slowly,
and to be a long time before you are able to
work.
APES.
To dream of these mischievous animals, fore-
bodes no good ; they are a certain sign of wick-
ed and secret enemies, who will seek by many
devices to injure you, be therefore upon your
guard, for some one who pretends to be your
friend, is about to deceive you, and you are very
near losing your liberty; after such a dream
a change of place is adviseable ; if you are in
love, do not attempt to m?irry your then sweet-
heart, for he or she will prove unfaithful, and in-
volve you ia much trouble ; if you have a law-
suit with any one, make it up as soon as you can,
otherwise it will injure you greatly : if you are
in busiaess, be extremely circumspect in your
transactions, for danger is near; you will lose
some friends by the malicious persecution of a
pretended friend of your own,
APPAREL.
Nothing more demonstrates the events that are
about to happen to you, than dreaming of wear-
ing apparel ; but almost every colour has a differ-
ent interpretation, and must depend on its ap-
pearing new or old, its fitting you, or being too
big or too little. We shall here explain them ac-
cording to their different significations.
To dream you are dressed m white, is a sure
token of success in the first object you undertake,
16
and that you will be successful in love, and that
your sweetheart is of good temper and amiable
dispositioa.
To dream you are dressed in ^reeih denotes
that you are about to take a journey to your ad-
vantage, and that your sweetheart .prefers you to
all other lovers.
To dream you are dressed in blacky is an un-
lucky omen; some quarrel is about happen be-
tween you and a friend or a relation ; sickness is
about to attend you raid your family; death will
deprive you of some near friend or* relation ; law-
suits w^ill perplex and harrass you ; if you un-
dertake a jourrsey, it will be unsuccessful, «fld
contribute much to injure your health and for-
tune. If you are in love, it denotes that your
sweetheart is very unhappy and that sickness
will attend her ; if you are a farmer, you will be
cheated by some knave, and your crops will turn
out indiiferent, the murrain will attack your cat-
tle, and some dreadful accident will happen by
the overturning of one of your waggons : if you
are in bnsiness, some one will arrest you, and
you will have great difficulty in settling the mat-
ter.
To dream you are dressed in blue^ denotes
happiness ; you will shortly be invited to some
banquet or merrymakiog, when you will make
some friends and be very happy, if you only
avoid quarreling, to which som.e enemy to your
ivelfare will excite you. Your sw'eetheart is by
this colour denoted to be very faithful to you,
and will make you very happy ^nd comfortable,
you will have many children chiefly boys, who
w ill turn out honest and good ; if you are in tradCj
you will prosper.
17
If you dreatn you are dressed in scarlet, you
are thereby warned of some very heavy calamily,
aud «a severe fit of illness ; your sweetheart is by
it announced to you to be of a turbulent disposition,
much inclined to dispute about trifles, and liable
to make you very unhgppy your children will be
but ?hort lived and of very unhappy tempers
much inclined lo be very sickly it surely denotes
a quarrel aud the loss of friends.
To dream you are dressed in t/cUgw, is rather
lucky than otherwise, but your sweetheart by
it appears to be very jealous of you, and great
pains will be requisite to prevent your separating ;
if you are married, keep a good lookout, for
some one is about to alienate the affections of
your partner ; in trade, it promises prosperity,
but Fome one will cheat you out of a tritle not of
much consequence. If you are a farmer, you
Trill have an abundant crop; if you undertake a
voyage by sea, you w^ill be greatly the gainer by
it; and if you e?v'pect any place or preferment,
after mucli trouble you v. ill attain it.
To dream you are dressed in crimson^ desotes
that the dreamer will live to a sood old age, and
be neither very fortunate or unfortunate through
life ; you are about to experience some very plea-
sant news from a distant quarter, and from those
you thought dead; your sweetheart will be obli-
ged to leave you for a time, but will continue
faithful to you : if you are in trade you will ex-
perience gome lo?s by a person you had great con-
fidence in, but you will nearly at the same time,
get a job that will amply make you amends; it
denotes a snial! dispute between a landlord and
his tenant, whicli will be settled amicably to the
advantnge of the latter,
b2
18
To flream you are dressed in a variety of col-
mirs, denotes a variety of fortu;ies is about to at-
tend you ; old friends will desert you, new ones
%viii supply their place; if you are in love, a
quarrel will take place between you and your
sweetheart, which will, after much uneasiness to
both parties, be adjusted by friends ; be cautious
in what you do for some lime, for many traps will
be laid to ensnare you, but on no account trust
yourself on the water; your relations will short-
ly die, and if you have any children, sickness will
attend them ; if ycu are cick at the time of the
dream, it denotes a happy and speedy recovery.
To dream you are fashionably drest, and in
good company, is very good for the dreamer; he
will rise considerably above his present condition ;
your sweetheart will prefer you above others, and
be very good tempered; v/hatever you under-
take will have a prosperous issue, and some un-
expected news of an agreeable nature will reach
you ; expect to see a long absent friend return in
very good circumstances; but avoid having a
dispute with any one, for it v/ill %o against yon,
and do much harm, particularly if it be with your
sweetheart. To dream you are dressed sliabbi-
ly, tliat your clothes are rf.g«ed and torn, is a
very bad omen. If you are in love, it denotes
you will never marry the person io whom you are
attached; some heavy and asHicting loss is about
to attend you; you will surely ^o to jail, unless
you take extraordinary care; if you are married,
you will quarrel with your spouse, and much do-
mestic strife will ensue ; if you go to sea, ycu will
be cast away, and in ^reat dan^-er of starving;
if you are in business, you will be robbed of a
considerable quantity of goods; aad the next par-
19
eel of goods you purchase you will lose by ; if
you are a farmer, beware what compaiiT you
keep when you ;^o to markc^t, for sharpers will
lay wait for you, and endeavour to cheat you ^
ifitishay time, look well to your hay ricks, for
such a dream denotes that a rick will take fire,
and be burnt to rubbish ; some quarrel will en-
sue between you and a friend, which will end to
your disadvantage.
To dream your clothes fit you well, and are
comfortable to the season of the year, is favorable
and denotes succes? if you are in love, you will
be speedily married if you are married you will
soon have a child, most likely a boy, if it is, he
will be a great scholar, and be advanced to great
dignities in the state.
To dream your clothes do not fit you, and that
they are not suitable to the season, denotes the
death of some friend, and a loss by iire if you
are in love, the person who is your lover is not
the one intended to marry you it also denotes
the place you live in is not calculated for your
prosperity and happiness, and is a warning for
you to quit it if you have children, some one
of them will shortly be in great aSliction ; if they
are grown up, one of them is near losing its liber-
ty ; if they are young, then expect sickness to

after many troubles and difficulties you will be-
come rich and happy ; to the lover, it foretels ma-

great comfort in the evening of life : to the trades-
man, it foretels increase of business and accumu-
lation of wealtli, but also forewarns him that he has
a servant unworthy of his confidence ; to the sai-
lor, nothing can be a greater sign of good luck, his
next voyage will be pleasant, and lucrative, and
his sweetheart kind aud true. To dream you see
them dispersing, and running away from you,
shews that pretended friends are endeavouring to
do you an injury, and that your children will meet
with persecution and great troubles ; in love, such
a dream shews your sweetlteart to be fickle, and
little calculated to make you happy. To dream
you see sheep-shearing, is indicative of loss of
property, and the affections of the person you love,
also of your liberty. To dream you are shearing
them yourself, shews that you will gain an ad van-
tage over some person that meant to harm you,
and that you will get the better of difficulties, and
marry the object of your affections.

tempt to be rude with her, but that her honor will
be saved by the interposition of a stranger, who
will either marry her, or some friend of hers«
To dream your shoes are worn out and bad, shews
decay in circumstances, and loss of friends ; ia
love, it foretels the infidelity of your lover, who
82
will marry another. After such a dream I ad-
vise those who can, to change their place of resi-
dence, their present situation being hereby deno-
ted to be very unfavorable to them.

favorable if you kill much game : to the lover it
shews a mistress kind and good humored, who will

lings, they indicate the receipt of

small sum
of
83
ifnoney, and the acquisition of some new fnencls ;
but if they are half crowns or crown pieces, then

- Having now disposed, under general heads of
the various interpretations of dreams, we w^ish to
remark, that where ever we have made use ofthe
word LovERj we mean ittoapplyequally totliemale
and female. We also flatter ourselves,
f
hat the
explanations will be found sufficiently copious to
answer the expectations of all our readers, who
"will find them in comparison far beyond any thing
of the kind ever yet published. Indeed, unless
they were to pirate this work exactly they can ne-
ver produce more than
a
mutilated and defective
account of the science, because we are well as-
sured, that the original manuscripts were never
s^eH by any person in England, except the trans-
lators ; we shall therefore conchide tliis ailiclc
"with advice liow to obtaiii a clear and decisive
iuformatioe upoa any particular dreaiii^ which is
as follows.
When you dream of any thinof that you want to
have dniv explained write the subject dreami of,
on a piece of fair paper, fold his paper in the
form of a heart, get a gill of red wine, dip the pa-
per in
it,
and lav
it
under your pillow; just as
you are going to bed you must drink of the wine
at three draughts.
By following this mode punctually, you will in
your next dream have the full explanation of
your former one. This mode also will enable the
lover to dream of your sweetheart, by writing the
name of him or her on
a
small piece of gilt paper,
and observing the instructions above directed
;
mind the sir and christian names must be written
at full length, also the Rge.

AVe shall remark to our readers, that it is of much im-
portance to be particular in ascertaining the^exact situa-
tion of the Moles, its form, whether it be round, angular
or oblong ; also its size and color, because these variations
add or diminish the degree of those qualities and events
which our author^s explanation has attached to each ;
for example, if the mole be perfectly round, then it de-
notes much good fortune, if of an angular form, a mix*
ture of good and bad fortune, if oblong, then a moderate
portion of good, a kind of happy medium ; the deeper the
color the more powerful will be either the good or bad
fortune indicated ; the lighter in color either will be in a
less degree ; as our author has uniformly spoken of a me-
diate color neither dark nor light; if it be very hairy,
it denotes inany misfortunes, but not so if only a few long
hairs grow upon
it,
for then
it
shews prosperity in your
undertakings: again, the larger the mole
is,
the more
serious will be either the prosperity or adversity predict-
ed
;
and the smaller
it
is,
the less of either will fall to
your share
;
our author has taken the middling size.
Persons who wish to avail themselves fully of our au-
thor's information, should not suffer an overstrained bash-
fulness to prevent their obtaining accurate information
with respect to the situation, size, form and color
;
es-
pecially as in women a mole
is
frequently so situated in
those recesses which modesty conceals from view, as not
to admit of being discovered but by another
;
and yet to
have
a
mole so placed
is
the most fortunate for them.

CHARTOLOGY.
Or^ the science of foreiellino; eunts by canUtossing.
AS many of those events about to happen may be
easily, gathered frQ^n the cards, we have here affixed the
definition which each card in the pack bears separately;
by the combining; them the reader must judge for himself^
observing the following direction, in laying them out^
^irst, the person whose fortune is to be told, if a man,,
must chuse one of the four kings to represent himself if
a woman, she must select one of the queens, then the
queen of the chosen king, or the king of the chosen queen,,
will stand for the husband or wife, mistress or lover of
the party whose fortune is to be told, and the knave o£
the suit for the most intimate person df their family ; you
must then shufle and cut the cards well, and let the per-
son ivhosfB fortune is to be ascertained, cut them three
times, shewing the bottom card ; this must be rer f^nted
three times; then shutRe them again, let them becut onee^
and display them on rows on a table, taking care alwHyg
to have an odd number in each row, nine is the right
Biumber, and to place your cards exactly under ( ach,
other, after this consult the situation in which thf person
stands by the definition we have here annexed toecah rarjS^
and after having repeated it three times, form your con-
clusion, remember that every thing is within your circle^
as far as you can count thirteen nny way from th* card
that represents the person, his wife, or her husband, and
their intimate friend ; and also that the thirteenth card
every way is of the greatest consequence; either the
whole pack, or only the picquet cards may be used.
Another mode with the picquet cards is to shuffle and
cut them, take three cards from the top ; if there be two
of a suit, takeout the highest card, if three*, take all;
when you have gone through the pack ; shuffle and cut
the remainder, and do as before, and repeat the same a
third time, then take a general view of all the cardr?
ilrawn, and next couple them, a top and and a bottom
card, then shuffle and cut them into three heaps, laying;
one apart in the first round to form a fourth heap ; the
first heap at the l^ft hand relates to yoursel-f entirely, the
next to your family ; the third is the confirmation of tho
former two ; yoii must proceed a second and third time.
adding ev.zh time one to the single card, and '];en thve^-
99

serve you must ailil the card which represents the per-
son whose fortune is eonsulletl to tiie three, itit be not

be of a roving disposition, never contented with his lot,
and forever meeting with vexations and disappointments,
and risks a shameful end.
The eight of dianwnds-^Shews that the person in their
youth will be an enemy to marriage, and thus run the
risque of flying unmarried ; but that if they do marry, it
will bo late in life, and then it will be with a person
whose disposition is so ill assorted to theirs, that it will
be the cause of misfortunes.
The seven of diamonds-^Sfhews that you will spend

conjugal partner, and the squandering of your substance.

mature widowhood ; but that your second marriage will

person you \\ ill be married to, and very great vexation

good humor ; if the ace be attended by spades, it foretels
quarrelling in your cups, and ill temper to your family
while you are in a state of intoxication ; if by hearts it
shews ordialrty and aifection between the parties ; if by
diamonds, your feast will be from home, perhaps in the
country ; if by clubs, the occasion of the meeting will be
upon some bargain or agreement ; if your ace of hearts is
in the neighborhood of face cards of both sexes, witli
clubs near, it will be about a match making, if all the

queens and knaves, it will be about the reconciliation and
reunion of a married couple.

of an easy and good natured disposition, but inclined to
be hasty and passionate, and rash in his undertakings.
The queen of hearts Shew'S a w^oman of a very fair

dient wife, nor one who will be very happy in her ©wn
reflections.
The knave of hearts Is a person of no particular sex,
but alway^s the dearest friend or nearest relation of the
consulting party% ever active and intruding, equally jeal-
ous of doing barm or good as the whim of the moment
strikes, passionate and hard to be reconciled, but alwavn
102
r^eaious and warm in the cause of the consulting party,
though probably not according to their fancy, as they
will be as industrious to prevent their schemes as to for-
ward them, if they do not accord with his own disposi-
tion.
You must pay great attention to tlie cards that stand
next to the knave, as from them alone you can judge
whether the person it represents will favor your inclina^
lion or not.
The ten of hearts Shews good nature, and many child-
ren ; it is a corrective to the bad tidings of the cards, but
may stand next to it; and if its neighboring cards are of
good import, it ascertains and confirms their value.
The nine of hearts Promises wealth, grandeur, anc!
high esteem ; if cards that are unfavorable stand near it,
you must look for disappointment and a reverse ; if fa-
vorable cards follow these last at a small distance, expect
to retrieve your losses, whether of peace or of goods.
The eight of hearts Points out a strong inclination to
get intoxicated, this, accompanied with unfavorable
cards, will be attended with loss of property, decay of
health and falling off of friends ; if by favorable cards, it
indicates reformation and recovery from the bad conse-
quences of the former.
The seven of hearts Shews the person to be of a fickle
and unfaithful disposition, addicted to vice and incontin-
ence, and subject to the mean art of recrimination to ex-
cusie themselves, although without foundation.
The six of hearts i^hews generous, open, and credu-
lous disposition, easily imposed upon and ever the dupe
of flatterers, but the good natured friend of the distressed.
If this card comes before your king or queen you will
be the dupe, if after, you w^ill have the better.
The five of hearts Shews a wavering unsteady disposi-
tion, never attached to one object, and free from any vi-
olent passion or attachment.
Thefour of hearts Shews that the person will not be
married till very late in life, and that this will probably
proceed from too great a delicacy in making a choice.
The tray of hearts Shews that your own imprudence
will greatly contribute to your experiencing the ill will
of others.
Tkfi deuce of hear Is Shews that extraordinary success
103
anil g:oo(l fortune will atteml the person, though if unfa-
vorable cards nltenil, this will be a long time .lelayed.

without specifyinij; whether lawful or uiilawlul.
