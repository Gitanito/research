I remember the ambulance attendant slapping my face and saying, ‘come on boy! You're going to make it.’ Then everything went black.

In the urgency department I still heard a nurse saying ‘Ha mais um batimento para suportar a vida.’ ‘There's still one more beat supporting life. Here comes the spooky bit. I was in a fast-moving stream just approaching some rocks at the edge of the falls I was about to go over. I could see the vegetation on the opposite bank in vivid autumnal colors. The water was warm and I was very comfortable and not a bit scared. Then it ceased before I was about to go over the edge.

I still feel a slight feeling of disappointment that I did not ‘shoot the falls’!

Background Information:   
  NDE Elements:

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?       Yes         Bronchospasm with respiratory failure.

Did you feel separated from your body?    No

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?       I was unconscious.

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?       No

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?       No

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?       No

Did you see an unearthly light?       No

What emotions did you feel during the experience?       I was extremely comfortable and unafraid.

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?       No

Did scenes from your past come back to you?       My past flashed before me, out of my control

Did scenes from the future come to you?       No       

God, Spiritual and Religion:

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?       Yes     I do not fear death as much as I used to.  

     After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      No

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       No

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?        The best was knowing the fulfillment that the experience brought. The worst was the moments when I wasn't experiencing anything.

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     Yes    They seemed bored by it. They were probably unable to comprehend the reality of it. It seemed that way to me at the time.

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?       Nothing that I can think of.
