    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Advanced Thought and Divine Science.
 1920?  Monthly
 Valhalla, NY.  Publisher: Robinson Publishing Company.  Editor: Miss A.M. Robinson, "Inspired Teacher".
 16 pp., $1.00 a year (which also entitled the subscriber to "a daily healing treatment through the Healing Centre—by spirits with divine power").

 The journal was a  mixture of old-time spiritualism as it survived after World War I, Divine Science (as propounded by Malinda E. Cramer and supplemented by Angel Messengers), and advertisements for the likes of Prof. C. Braganza, "the celebrated Hindu seer, astrologer, psychic poet and life reader."  It touted Robinson’s series of lessons for "students of Spirit Mediumship" and published messages from the spirits of readers’ deceased relatives as well as from Robert G. Ingersoll, Henry George, Henry W. Longfellow, Chester A. Arthur, Benjamin F. Butler, Henry Ward Beecher, et al, and Robinson’s accounts of her "Spiritual Visit to Planet Mars" and "Astral Travel toward the Sun," and the like.  The Astrological Department was conducted by C.P. Christensen, one-time publisher of the Spiritualist of New York—of which an A.M. Robinson was listed as an owner.  Contributions by Uriel  Buchanan, a regular contributor to Sydney B. Flower’s New Thought.        Issues:Advanced Thought And Divine Science V2 N15 Advanced Thought And Divine Science V2 N16 Advanced Thought And Divine Science V2 N18       </p>
