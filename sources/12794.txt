  		              		Experience Description   

    It is hard to describe where I was because it is nearly indescribable in the human language. 

  I went into surgery for my third back surgery. I remember seeing what everyone thinks as the 'tunnel' of light and remember feeling a familiar presence. Then I came back.   The experience humbled me in a calm and beautiful way.  It was powerful enough to radically change my views of this earth.  I had total peace inside.

   Several years had passed and I re-injured my back. During the fifth surgery, I woke up and was fully conscious. I reached up and grabbed the clamp, when the medical personnel  slammed my head back and stuffed a tube in my mouth. 

   At that point, things went dark for a moment. Then I saw the light again. But this time, I understood that the light that I was looking at, was my own. Once I focused past the light, I understood everything. I felt the overwhelming feeling of everyone that has ever existed was focusing all of ther love at me all at once. There is no start or  ending and there is no time in between. You can be anywhere or everywhere all at once. There is no hate or judgement. There is  no pain. Everyone we ever knew here on earth is there. We are all equal there. When I came back, it was with help. I didn't want to come back, but it was not my time. I did not discuss it with anyone for fear of the doctors not wanting to help fix    the damage that was caused from me waking up. I was also afraid  of what others might think.

  During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Yes     I had an awareness of my being and how I fit into the big picture  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     we are all one.  There is no individuality as we would describe here. We are all energy, and I could become each energy. There is an absolute understanding of everyone and everything.

  Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I am able to project my love through sight and touch  
  
After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   words cannot describe the emotion. There is the love of all, all at once and all the time. I cannot describe the knowledge that was there. There was unity of all at once. I could be anywhere, anytime in any space in any form or mind. The communication there is not in words but in energy. I was not just myself, but I was  everyone.  
  
  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  My childhood memories were misplaced upon my return.  
  
Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          The incredible feeling of love was especially meaningful and significant to me.  
  
  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Ten years from the experience I told  my story. I told a complete stranger who was mourning the death of her husband. I tried my best to explain where I went and where he is. We were both profoundly overwhelmed,  bathed in love, and crying happy tears. I truly believe it changed her entire view of death  
  
Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I still feel it inside me.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     There is no denying where I went  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

  Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         The love we can understand here at its maximum, is only a grain of sand in a desert compared to the love you have over there.
