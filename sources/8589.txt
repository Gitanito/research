  &nbsp;

  Hi,

  my name is Meera Jacka and I need help:   at the end of term two I made it into a program known 
  as eGATS (email gifted and talented students program). During this program I am   given challenges 
  which require much research and are extremely difficult.

  I am reaching the end of the program and   must now perform a major task and I am allowed to
  choose my own topic. Our theme this year is &#65533;Making connections&#65533; and I have   chosen &#65533;The
  connection between life and death.... by looking at near death experiences.&#65533;

  For this task I have decided to   interview people who have had a near death experience, asking 
  them to do me two favours if they are willing:

  &nbsp;

  1. Would you be willing to write me   your close death experience, including what 
  you felt, what you saw, and how it has effected you/changed your life

  2. And would you be willing to paint   me a picture expressing how you felt, and 
  describing all that happened using colours to paint whatever you feel tells a   story.

  &nbsp;

  P.S. this artwork would be the centre   piece of my project and is extremely important.

  You can send it to me scanned via   e-mail ( emotionalcompetency@gmail.com)  
  or to the&nbsp;   address   below.

  &nbsp;

  Thank you,

  &nbsp;

    Meera

Rudi   	Rudenski

On the way to a secret military base   in 1982, Rudi Rudenski died in a car accident:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;As far as how I changed:

Prior to my NDE, I believed G-d hated   people who were Gay, Atheists, Communists, Muslims, Catholics and I even   believed that most human beings would burn in hell because they did not believe

in my religion...

My NDE changed that about me. I learned   that The Light I met in heaven loved the very people I thought G-d hated like   crazy...

When I returned to my body and   re-entered the military, I could no longer hate the enemies of my country enough   to kill them or help others do so... so I left the army... I was disgusted by   religious intolerance after my NDE and could not step foot in a religious   building for years as the teachers of my brand of religion taught a hateful   story of a villain deity that far and away not recognizable in context to the   being of Light I met in my NDE.

In my NDE, I met a being much like Jesus   and I met a being I called G-d but The Light didn't wear that name well. Today,   I have a personal name for G-d and I call it Y-h(pronounced Yaw) which to me is   like a set of verbs and verbish words disguised as adjectives are all added   together and becomes a noun like being also called The Light by many who have   NDE's:&nbsp; Kindness; Compassion, Gentleness, Beauty, Dignity,&nbsp; and deep down belly   laughter, all added together&nbsp; is often assumed to be a noun called Love. I have   also called this being the sum of all love...

Today, I teach blind and visually   impaired adults and children to live independently and help them return to work.   I consider serving others with laughter and loving kindness to be the prime   directive. Those moments when we love others and when we are loved by others are   timeless pieces of The Light... Even when we die... those moments go on and   on... All of our less than love dies and is forgotten but our kindnesses are a   part of timelessness so we should do our best to be loving kind and not sweat   the small stuff. I understood how The Light loved a bully like me and if The   Light could love someone who thought G-d hated everyone not like me then think   how much The Light could love someone who made their life about love.

Today, I cobble bits and pieces from my   former religion into a theology of Loving Kindness... and I chose a different   career from being a soldier who constantly contemplated murdering people The   Light loves. My career has changed over the years into something else:

I taught English in Mexico and   emphasized love; I worked with thousands of at-risk children teaching   alternative energy and environmental education; I worked with deaf children and   blind children to teach them science and life skills; I worked with blind adults   to teach them how use power-tools for gaining confidence and then they made   beautiful furniture; I taught others art using stained glass embedded in wood; I   now teach blind children and adults independent living skills such as cooking,   cleaning, braille, basic cane use, touch typing and how to use computers with   speech. I teach because I feel I can make a difference in people's lives. Many   of the human beings I work with are hopeless and in despair but through the   process of building their confidence, some will go to college or learn a skill.   Many go to work with their new skills and participate in life fully.

&nbsp;My life is a far cry from the days when   my heart was filled with murder. Love takes on many forms. If you take anything   from reading or hearing me talk about my NDE, I hope it is that our love is   timeless so be timeless. Do as little harm as possible but don't beat yourself   up when you fail to live up to the Highest Ideal of love. Love is really all   that survives time so love.

Love &amp; Dances,

  Rudi

Feb 26 2005

After being hit head on by a 4WD vehicle   and my little car completed: with loud bangs and crash sounds and smashing   glass; I feared the worst; ...I asked for protection.

The next thing I knew I was in the   precense of something wonderful. It felt warm, comforting. I could feel layers   of energy deep and wide, yet strongly calm.

I remember saying I couldn&#65533;t die because   my daugther was too young to loose her mother. Then I became fully aware of what   surrounded me. Colours were soft, clear and jet if felt more like light soft and   strong that dominated. It was like nothing I had ever experienced. Instinctively   I knew I was somewhere amazing and very special.

I was told I was not staying: However I   needed to be shown how much I was loved....then I saw my life (as they say) pass   before me: And it the most striking thing was NO JUDGEMENT!!!

All my life I lived with harsh   judgements and critisisms and yet in that place there was none at all.   Noticeably ABSENT!

&nbsp;I was told I was loved and valued and   thanked for the sacrifices and efforts made with a range of issues in my life. I   was also told of somethings yet to happen as if to prepare me. And I was given   deep insights into the hearts of people close to me. There was no pain at all,   no fear, nothing remotely negative of concerning.... I felt filled with support,   comfort, calm and unconditional love....none of which I had known before.

Too soon it seemed I was back and the   pain crippling &#65533; I was so captivated by this experience I resolved to do better,   to live better.

There were many times in my long slow   rehabilitation when I seriously doubted its authenticity until something was   said or would happen as I was TOLD it would .As if spirit known and reepted my   doubts and analytical nature. &#65533; For its rightness and truthfulness - so I would   not doubt but love instead.

This is a true and accurate account to   the best of my knowledge.   

  	D.S. Weiler

  I had a million   thoughts as I went. Having time for so many thoughts made it seem like it should   have been a longer time.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That   I had thoughts confused me. I tried to define what was happening to me. &quot;I&quot;, an   aware self, was still &quot;me&quot; and, apparently alive. I could not see myself. I   could not raise my hand to look at it, but I was something - I still felt like   &quot;myself&quot;. I was still thinking and feeling - but not in a body, not with a   physical brain. I was moving without legs. At least, I couldn't see any part of   myself. I assumed I had no legs, no hands, no arms, no feet or anything you   would normally look at to see if it was there. I felt surprise and wonder. I   knew the meaning of those concepts, too. How can I know anything? I'm dead!

  I floated &quot;higher&quot; or   further. I lack a better word for the sensation or the direction. Still, I knew   movement was happening to me. I was no longer in my body. I knew I was not on   this planet. I knew that &quot;I&quot; was not dead, not the way we mean the word. Dead   means dead; No power, no lights on, party's over, no thinking. no feeling. I was   dead but I was not un-alive, not unaware. I knew I lived. I didn't know why or   how. I couldn't figure it out.

  For one moment I was so   sad my children and my mother would be grieved by my death. I regretted the pain   my death would cause my family. Then something changed in me. That sad thought   faded away and I was overcome by a deeply peaceful joy. It was like I let all   the cares and concerns that are so much a part of us leave with my body.

As this feeling   passed through me I saw, off to my right, a golden glow, a light in the   darkness, like a city's lights on the night sky. It lit the way for me. It was   not dark anymore. The light was shining, just over there from me. I say &quot;I saw&quot;   but I had no eyes. It's another confusion with words and concepts I can't say   well here. But I could see the golden light. It was like a candle behind a   curtain. Shaded, but enhanced by the darkness to a brighter brightness.

  What I learned next   amazed me. I discovered that the glowing, golden globe of light was alive. It   was a &quot;self&quot;. It was a living being. We were the same! We were both living   beings. This felt like a huge revelation; &quot;Hey, it's another soul!&quot; It was huge,   loving and powerful, strong and gentle all at the same time. I felt small and   confused but I knew it was alive. It knew &quot;self and other&quot; the same way I did   still. I wasn't dead, it wasn't dead, but it didn't look like a human. It just   felt like a human to me. I was aware of its &quot;self-ness&quot;. It was aware of my   &quot;aliveness&quot;. It was strange to look at something I thought of as so different   from me and find out it was not different. I couldn't say it was &quot;human&quot; and had   been living on &quot;earth&quot;, but it was another living, aware self. We were alike!

  That other self was   &quot;human&quot; or &quot;like me&quot; in feeling but powerful beyond description. I was   fascinated by it. I felt the power the Being appeared to generate and that was   sent out from it. It was like standing in the sunlight but, instead of sunshine,   LOVE warmed you through to your center. It was like nothing and no one I have   ever seen or met but I knew it only loved.. I could feel Love radiating off that   Being and flowing into and through everything around it. It knew me in all I   was, in all my life, in all my truth. I could not hide anything from it. I had   no desire to hide anything. I felt no fear or shame that it &quot;saw&quot; all of me.

  That being knew all of   everything I ever was and loved me. Not just loved me but every thing that   defined me as my self, unique from any other bit of creation, was wonderful to   it. It loved the way I was made, it loved that we were meeting, it loved me with   all the love it had in it and I knew that I was precious to it and treasured by   it. I was perfectly what I was supposed to be and it loved me just that way.

  If I had been a diamond   I was flawless, perfectly cut and beautiful beyond needing any other change. I   could not be more loved by it if I changed even one thing in myself. I was   perfect - as I was made. I feel it may have thought, &quot;as I made you. I did you   perfectly!&quot; That Being loved me so deeply that it would never hurt me. It only   wanted my complete, loving self to be all the me I am. I didn't have to be   anything but my real self. Truth lies there. Unconditional love sees only the   beauty of the truth in each living spirit.

  We began to communicate   when I understood it was &quot;speaking&quot; to me. I &quot;heard&quot; it address me. Then I knew   it could &quot;hear&quot; what I wanted to share with it. It was not with spoken words but   more like with complete thoughts with no possibility of misunderstanding. It was   a true communication of perfect understanding between two spirits. I would &quot;ask&quot;   then would &quot;know&quot;.

  I did not need to   change one thing to be perfect. I was perfect to it. I knew it felt a true joy   in being with me. I felt like it was just bursting with happiness because I was   there. It was beyond glad to see me, it loved me. It thought I was just   perfectly made and was thrilled that we were together. I repeat this because it   amazed me.

  I was seeing myself out   of it's own vision. It saw me as a beautiful, perfect, shining, living being,   full of love and peace, filled with joy. I saw myself, but I saw me as it did, a   being of golden light and love. I loved being me for the first time I could   remember.

  I saw the truth of what   I was. I was filled with the joy in the knowledge that I was a loving self and I   loved the being who showed me the love in my self. It showed me we are alike, we   are both living, we are both of Love and you are beautiful and made of love, as   am I.I knew all of me the way that being knew me and I saw that each experience   and person here was a part of me still. Each each part of my life was needed to   make me completely what I was; Perfect in it's eyes. I would appear to be   perfect again today if I stood there, even though I have changed from the woman   I was then.

  That is the meaning of   the grace. You are loved as you are - not as you wish to be, not as you should   have been, not as someone else says you have to be - but for exactly what you   are. The truth of what you are is only good. There is no shame or guilt because   you understand what life here and the love in you experienced is just that -   being alive as a human. There is no way to feel ashamed for you are exactly what   you were created to be. Your life and you are showed to so you understand you   did everything from love. There is nothing to regret or be sorry for any more   when you see that we are all moved by love and trying to express it or move by   the percieved lack of love and trying to share it.

  As I saw myself from   the eyes of that being, I knew I was good. I was goodness. I was not just,   &quot;okay&quot;. I was perfect and I was loving and I was good. I saw, in my own   judgement, that I was love, loving - good. To see my self as good again, like I   knew I was when I was a child - oh, my heart, how I wish to keep that feeling   with me here. How I wish I could give that feeling to you..   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    D.S.

TRANSLATION FROM THE GERMAN ORIGINAL:

NDE with 6 years old:

I had to undergo a tonsillitis   operation. There was no way of getting around that operation due to constant   severe infections because of my tonsillities. I was getting weaker and sicker   with fever infections more and more often.

My last memory before the operation was   me struggling against the gas mask,&nbsp; feeling slightly out of breath and the   smell of ether. The doctor and my mother were with me. After that my sense of   time and direction went missing.

When my conscious came back I noticed   myself flying though a square, yellow-blue shining tunnel. My awareness of self   was&nbsp; all of a sudden very clear and strong, I remember it as if it was   yesterday: THIS was me, so beautiful, shining and alive! I flew effortless and   was drawn without feeling any resistance to it.

In the beginning the tunnel started   glowing gently, but then it became more and more intense and brighter.&nbsp; I had   the feeling of depth and dimension. My speed towards the light at the end of the   tunnel increased, also the intensity of the colours deepened and in addition I   was now&nbsp; full of and expectant joy. A sense of warmth went through and through   me.

With the increasing speed I saw blue and   yellow shining lines fly past with great speed. Intensity&nbsp; of light and my clear   consciousness grew with increase of speed until reaching a complete high: &#65533;Now   it is all going to happen!&#65533; &#65533; but then I saw glowing spitting sparks and I   bumped into some sort of net of electricity, which stopped my acceleration.

Unexpectedly interrupted from my joyful   expectation I awoke with a shock , feeling numb, dizzy and disorientated in the   operating room. I was back and the doctor showed great relief as it had been   difficult reaching me and to wake me up he had to shake me violently. For a long   time all my attention was inwards&nbsp; and I remained in this dreamy sense of   lightness. My interest for every day things went missing and for some years I   stayed withdrawn and locked into a dream world build out of my special   experience.

I remained for years between &quot;here and   there&quot; in day dreams and with low interest for this life, I didn't really love   this life on earth for many years. But later the joy came back.&nbsp;

My experience was life changing and my   NDE caused some abilities. Precognition, out of body experiences,&nbsp; going into   the other world to my grandfather and seeing&nbsp; deceased relatives. But I didn't   share this very often.&nbsp; I enjoy the abilities and sense them as very   life-enhancing.

Below my NDE   experience with picture. I hope, you can translate it. My english is not very   good, and so I hadn't written it on the NDERF page, only in the forum.

This experience was   life changing, I remained for years between &quot;here and there&quot;, in daydreams and   with&nbsp; low interest in this life, I didn't really love this life on earth for   many years. But later the joy came back.&nbsp;

My NDE caused some   abilities. Precognition, OBE,&nbsp; going in the other world to my grandfather and   seeing&nbsp; deceased relatives. But I didn't share this very often. I enjoy this   abilities and sense them as very life-enhancing.

GERMAN ORIGINAL:

Nahtoderlebnis   mit 6 Jahren:

Eintritt in den   Tunnel. Bei mir stand eine Mandeloperation (tonsillectomy) an. Sie war   unumg&#65533;nglich, wegen st&#65533;ndiger Vereiterungen und dem daraus folgenden&nbsp;   Krankheitsherd, der mich in kurzen Abst&#65533;nden immer wieder mit Fieberanf&#65533;llen   schw&#65533;chte.

Meine letzte   Erinnerung vor der Operation war die heftige Gegenwehr gegen die Gesichtsmaske,   eine leichte Atemnot und der Geruch nach &#65533;ther. Der Arzt und meine Mutter waren   anwesend. Dann schwand meine Erinnerung und mein Zeitgef&#65533;hl ging verloren.

Als mein   Bewusstsein wieder einsetzte, flog ich durch einen quadratischen, gelb-blau   leuchtenden Tunnel. Mein Selbst-Bewusstsein war sofort und sehr klar da, ich   erinnere mich bis heute noch deutlich daran: DAS war ich und so strahlend,   lebendig. Ich flog oder wurde gezogen, ohne jeden Kraftaufwand oder Widerstand.

Zuerst leicht und   langsam, der Tunnel leuchtete heller und mit intensiver Farbe, ich hatte ein   r&#65533;umliches Empfinden. Meine Geschwindigkeit in Richtung Licht am Ende wurde   h&#65533;her, auch die Strahlkraft der Farben gewann an Intensit&#65533;t und jetzt stellte   sich zus&#65533;tzlich ein Zustand freudiger Erwartung ein. W&#65533;rmegef&#65533;hle durchfluteten   mich.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Mit zunehmender   Geschwindigkeit flitzten jetzt rechts und links blaue und gelb leuchtende   Streben rasend schnell vorbei. Lichtstrahlung und klares Empfinden wuchsen   proportional mit dem Gef&#65533;hl, immer schneller zu werden bis zum Hochgef&#65533;hl: &quot;Jetzt   kommt der Durchbruch&quot; - aber vor mir spr&#65533;hten Funken und ich prallte gegen eine   Art elektrisches Gitter, welches mir den Weg abschnitt. Abrupt aus der   ungeduldigen, freudigen Erwartung herausgerissen wachte ich dumpf, benebelt und   wenig klar im OP Raum auf. Ich war zur&#65533;ck, der Arzt zeigte gro&#65533;e Erleichterung,   dass Aufwecken hatte sich schwierig gestaltete und viel Sch&#65533;tteln war notwendig   gewesen. L&#65533;ngere Zeit noch blieb ich in der tr&#65533;umenden Leichtigkeit des Erlebten   und der Blick war eher nach innen gekehrt. Mein Interesse f&#65533;r die t&#65533;glichen   Entdeckungen im normalen Alltag lie&#65533;en in der Folgezeit nach und ich blieb f&#65533;r   einige Jahre in meiner inneren, schwerelosen Traumwelt gebildet aus diesen   Erinnerungen h&#65533;ngen.
