foreign
this documentary is about the beginning
of a whole new time on Earth
the whole next phase of human
development and civilization is to bring
out this information to the public so
that&#39;s what Sirius is all about it&#39;s
named after a star
but it&#39;s really about Earth and that&#39;s
why we&#39;re doing on Earth Day
thank you
thank you God bless all of you
thank you
I&#39;m honored and touched and excited to
be here with all of you and I&#39;d like to
thank Thomas Jane for doing the
voiceover on this film
and I would love to thank arm kalika and
the whole production team at NeverEnding
light this has been quite a journey
through enormous adversity but we&#39;ve
gotten here and we got here because of
all of you and I want to thank you from
the depths of my heart because a year
ago I said we&#39;re going to do a film
funded by the people and it&#39;s going to
be supported for the people and then all
of you are going to be the Distributors
and we&#39;re going to leave the big macro
economic corporate folks behind and
we&#39;re going to do this
I want to put a special thanks to Chris
Chris satelli who has helped us put this
whole thing together Chris has been our
angel on this
it was a couple years ago at Sundance
that Chris had me come out and I asked
when I met some of the folks in this
business and then about a year and a
half ago he wouldn&#39;t have been here in
Los Angeles where I met Thomas Jane
thank you Thomas and then he has been
the person who has managed this entire
event if it wasn&#39;t for Chris we wouldn&#39;t
be sitting in these seats thank you
Chris again you&#39;re amazing person
thank you
and I really want to thank also my own
staff and volunteers we have 30 some
volunteers here who are helping make
this happen uh Sarah Barrett van Gilley
all these folks they&#39;ve really really
put this together but I have to say the
person I want to thank the most uh
who has put up
with me
and that&#39;s really saying something
for 34 years
four kids
six grandkids we just had a new one
in Boston of two weeks ago
and my wife Emily the light of my life a
true angel
and we are so indebted to you God bless
you Emily we would not be here without
you
now really what this is about for me and
I&#39;ll be brief because I know you didn&#39;t
really come here to see me you want to
see this film right
so
22 years ago I started on a journey that
took me through the Carters of power
and to the
Folks at the CIA
and around the world Ministers of
Defense we&#39;ve now I&#39;ve had conversations
with over 500 top secret military and
corporate uh witnesses to this secrecy
and what has really kept me going
is something that&#39;s in within my heart
that dawned when I first had contact
when I was quite Young
and I will tell you that these
civilizations are here waiting for us
to become a peaceful civilization so
they can Embrace us with open arms arms
oh yeah and that the Earth will become
part of an Interstellar family
it is time
and so for that reason
and in that Vision it has kept me going
now for all these years a few years ago
not far from here in Joshua Tree
National Park
with a group of people I went into a
cave and it was an ancient Shaman&#39;s cave
and I was doing a meditation with people
and it was really about the
transformation of life on Earth as well
as contact with these civilizations
and a vision came and a thought
and it said this is the vision that must
guide the world a world where we are no
longer fighting over resources a world
where we are living in peace because the
peace is built on a foundation of
Justice
and that Justice can only happen when
everyone on this planet is free and
everyone can live in abundance and you
know what we have the means to do that
now if all of us come together you know
the proceeds from this film are going to
go into a new energy lab so that we can
create the science and Technologies for
the people that have been taken from us
for a hundred years
and so here we are on Earth Day and so
as an emergency doctor I know an
emergency when I see one
all right and the Earth is in an
emergency humanity is in an emergency
but I see another time and it&#39;s very
near where we will come together as a
people and transform life on Earth where
we will live with free energy and
anti-gravity systems and Float from here
to Paris silently with no jet fuel being
consumed and I see a time when all the
people on Earth are going to have the
ability to be as one people
and one universe and this is really the
vision that has to guide how we go
forward because the science and
technologies that you will be introduced
to in this film can only be used for the
good of humanity and peace and so let us
all work together and vow to do that
that is what&#39;s kept me moving in this
direction I left my medical career to do
it I invite all of you to join us and I
want to give a shout out to all the
folks who are here we have people here
from Hong Kong Taiwan Australia Moscow
Poland Ireland all the cities around the
world who are listening and who are in
this room just tell everyone you know
that if we come together as a people we
can create the world of our dreams and
that&#39;s what this is really all about God
bless you and enjoy the film see you
later
