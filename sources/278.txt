ADVERTISEMENT
TO THE PRESENT EDITION.
BEING called upon to conduft a periodical
publication on the fubjedl of occult fcience, and find-
ing amongft the correfpondence of that work man^
requifitions for an eafy introduilion to the celeftial
fcience of Aftrology ;
and fuch an introdudfion noE
being compatible with the tenor of the faid work, I
'
thought I could not render the public a greater fer-
vice that way, than in publilhing this little tr^atife.
The alterations I have made in the, beginning of
this work are fuch as I truft the artift will acknow^
ledge to be for the heft. Some ufeful and neceflary
tables are alfo added in their proper places, and the,
whole made as familiar as pofiiblc.

PART L
Of the Definition of /jlrclc^y. i
Astrology is a mod ingenious and innocrnt::|
fcience,, teaching how to judge of future events, by
I the motion of the ftars and planets only.
Of the Tvjelve Signs, and their Di-vifiens..
The zodiac is a great circle of the fphere, and is di-J
'vided (as all other great circles are fuppofed to be) into)
;36o degrees, every degree is fubdivided into 6o other di-:
ivilions called minutes, and every minute into 6o feconds’,
land fo to thirds or farther at pleafure : every fign contains
;3o of thofe degrees, and fo the 12 figns fill the whole
lEodiack; for 12 times 30 is 360, &c. they are thus chu-
iraflered.

The firll 6 of thefe figns are (aid to be northern, becaufe
hey decline from the equinoxlal towards the north pole,
he latter 6 are faid to be fouthern, becaufe they decline
roni the equinoxial towards the fouth pole; and farther
)bferve that the circle of the zodiac cuts the equator (or
rquinoxial) in the very midft in two points, which are the
rery beginning of aries and libra, ufually called the equi-
loxial points.
Theie iz figns of the zodiac are divided into 4 tripli-
:ities, according to the 4 elements, fiery, airy, earthy,
ind watery.

There are alfo the feveral degrees of the figns which an
termed mafculine and feminine, and dark, light, fmpaky

The firft eight degrees of 'Y* are mafculine, and th<
ninth is feminine, from 9 to 1 are mafculine, from hence t<
22 is feminine, and fo of the reft.
The ufe of this diftindlion is briefly thus, if a qucftiod
be propofed concerning a thief, or a woman with child,
what is the fex : male or female. 1 fay when the teftimoH
nies fall equally, fo that neither angle, fign or planets dif-|
cover it, then examine the degree, the ]) is in, and thd
fignificator of the thief, or the degree of the cufp of tha
houfe the queftion relates unto, and judge from theuce, if,
mafculine, a male, if feminine, female : &c.
The degrees, light, dark, fmoa'icy, &c. only denote th^
beauty and deformity of the native or querent, and are fel 4
dom ufed, and therefore I forbear to infert them as wholiyj
ufelefs, and proceed to that which is more conliderable.

It is when planets are in one fign, degree and minute,
having no diftance from each other.
^ 'A fcxiile is when planets are two ligns or 6o degrees
diftance ; for you muft note that 30 deg. make a fign, it
being the 1 2th part of the zodiac, as Tf. in the firft degree
of <T, and ? in the firll degree of n, here If. and. ?
are in fe.ttile, becaufe two figns diftant, which is 60
degrees.
a A quartile, or fquare is when planets are 3 figns
diftant, or 90 degrees, being the 4th part of the zodiac; as
in the 5th degree of 'ir, and S five degrees in ss.
A A trine is when planets are 4 figns, or 120 degrees
diltant, it being one third part of the heavens, as d' one
degree In <Y’, and If. one degree ofiCf.
g An oppofition is fix figns, or 180 degrees diftant,
it being half the circle of the zodiac or fphere ; as ^ in <v',
and D in Libra.
There are other radiations or afpefts of the planets, in-
vented by Kepler, which are fuperfluous and unneceftary ;
befides, I find they difi'er from the truth, and therefore I
omit them.

Explanation.
By this table you may perceive a planet in V calls his
ilexter, or backward I’exiile to C ; and his fmiller, or
forward fextile to n : his a dexter to Vfj fquare fmiller to
25 ; A dexter to Jf, A finifter to Si ; and his g to A: ;
jobfcrve the fame in the reft.
T'he Nature of the .difpeSis.
A conjunflion is good with good planets, and contra;
A 3(c is an afpedl of friendlhip (though imperfeft.)
A D is an afpedl of imperfeifi enmity.
A A is an afpedl of true concord, perfect amity, love and
ifriendlhip, and the bell.
An § is an afpedl of perfeft hatred, and the worll.
The
(

^’he Ufes that are made of iheje Ajpeils.
• Example.
At the time of a perfons falling fick, or in queflions ofJ
ficknefs, if T? be in § to the afcendant Lord thereof, D
the fixth houfe or its Lord, it is an argument of a very 2
1/^ tVj#* mnrp /^Qnrrrfarrkiia ‘r-
tedious and lingering ficknefs ; and the more dangerous,
if he be Lord of the 6th, 8th or 12 th houfcs ; the fame
obletve of d' afpefting the fignificators as aforefaid, with :
this addition, that he makes the dillemper more violent,,
and the difeafe fooner ended, either with life or death,
their <5 ’s aud ’s is of the fame nature, though not fo vio-
lent as their g’s.
But when T? or S :4:’s or A’s the fignificator’s, there
is great hopes, ofrecovery, and that fuddenly, if If and S
be concerned as'fignificators.
By the fame method you may judge of the good or i’i*"'
fnctefs in any queftion relating to any matter or buiinefs ":

Of the ejjeniial dignities of the Planets, n.vith theirfortitudes
and debilities,
(From Coley’s Key New Filed.)
The knowledge of thefe things are abfolutely nec’elTary
for any artift to be well acquainted withal ; for without it,
no part of ailrology can he underftood ; know therefore
that a planet is faid to be eiTentially dignified, when he is
jiii his own houfe, exaltation, triplicity, term or face;,
ia table whereof with its explication immediately follows,
Jby which table you may colleft the fortitude and debilities,
lof the planets in any figure, and thereby find their ftrength
•and weaknefsj and accordingly order your judgment.

C 2 A Table
C 12 )
[ "3 J
97 e Vfe of the former Table.
Every planet hath two figns for his houfes, except O
jid 5 ,
tliey but one a piece ; T? hath lef and XC: ; If
> and K; S, -C, o, 51; .D. one of
jefe houfes is called diurnal, noted in the fecond column
V the letter D ; the other is nofturnal, noted by the let-
fr N. In thefe figns the planets have their exaltations,
xhich the third column points out, as the © in 19 Tj S
,3 y , S in n three degrees, &c. are exalted.
Thefe twelve figns are divided into four triplicitles.
^he fourth column tells you which planet or planets, both
rght and day govern each triplicity ; as over againft "Y*
you find G Tf, viz. 0 governeth by day in that
iplicity,, and If by night. Over againft « WR Icf, you
ind ¥ and D ; viz. that ? hath domination by day,
ind 5 by night, in that triplicity. Over againft n ^ XX?
loufind b which rule as aforefaid. Over againft 25
rr]^ K. you find $ who according to Ptolemy and
Waibod, ruleth only that triplicity both day and night.
Over againft ‘Y’, in the 5, 6, 7> ^ ^ 9^^^ columns,
Tou find 'll- 6, ¥ 14, which tells you, the firtt 6 degrees
bf a.re in the terms of If ; from 6 to 14 the terms
bf ¥ .
Over againft 'Y', in the 10, 11, and 12 columns, you
find $ 10, 0 20, ¥ 30» viz. the firft 10 degrees v,
are the face of $ ;
from 10 to 20, the face of 0 ; from
<20 to 30, the face of ¥ > ^0.
In the 13th column, over againft <T you find ¥ detri-
me’nt, viz. ¥ being in <T, is in a fign oppofite to one of
dicr houfes, and fo is faid to be in her detriment.
In the 14th column, over againft T you find 1?, over
rhishead, fall; that is, T? when he isin 'Y’, oppofite to
this exaltation, and fo is unfortunate, &c.
A planet dignified as abovefaid, is faid to be in his ef-
Ifential dignities ; accidental dignities are, when planets are
icafually in an angle or fuccedent houfe, direft free froih
jcombuftion.

A planet in his-houfe or exaltation, being fignificator of

any perfbn, denotes him to be in a happy and profperous
condition, not wanting for the goods of this life,, and coni-i
paratively as a man in his own caftle, fecure from danger. '
But a planet debilitated, as being in detriment or fall,
and afflifted, denotes the querent to be in a very low andi
mean condition, much dejefted and difconfolate, &c.
The Difeafes every PlanetJtgnif.es.
Under Saturn, are tooth-ach, quartain agues, all
difeafes of melancholy, leprofy, rhumes, confumptions,
black jaundice, palfy, trembling, vain fears, gouts of all

choler, pellilences, burning fevers, tertian and quotidian
agues, megrim, carbuncles and plague fores, burning,
fcalding, ring-worms, bliflers, phrenfy, yellow jaundice,
bloody-flux, fiflulas, (h, ingles, calentures, St. Anthony’s

To find what planet reigneth Saturday, Sept. 24th,
1791, at any hour of the day or night.
Look in the top row for the hour, if you want the day
i hour ; and in the fecond row, if you want the night hour;
; then in the fide column find the day of the week, andi the
I common angle of meeting fliews the planet. Thus at the
I
fecond hour after O rife in the morning, % or Jupiter
: reigneth ;
at the fourth the ©, &c. at the fixth at
night, after G fet, the O, at the ninth the 5 . At ift.
after Q fet, ^ ; at zd. the D , &c.
When, there is an inequality in the length of the days
;and nights; then to find, the true planetary hour, multiply
ithe hours of the day by fixty, viz. the number of hours
ifrom O tife to fun fet, and add the odd minutes, and di-
•vide the product by 12, the quotient is the length of the
ihour.

V brief Rebearfal of the general fgnifcations of the Sensen
Panels, (befides particular ftgnificators, as being Lords of
partiailar Houfes relating thereunto,) which ought to be had
in confideration by the Artift, in every i^eftion propounded.
As 'b denotes in general, lands, houfes, tenements,
lountrymen and ancient people.
If Signifies generally, judges, fenators, divines, riches,
die law, religion, &c.
$ Soldiers, phyficlans, war, ftrife and debate, theft,
ind all manner of cruelty, &c.
-n Signifies honour, greatnefs, noble perfons of all
xegrees, &c.
$ Generally denotes women, pleafure, paftlmes, all
.zind of delights, mirth, fweet odours, &c.
5 Denotes generally all kinds of feribes and fecretarles,
mathematicians, ferVants, and fuch like.
D Is a general figniftcatrlx in all queftions (as I noted
Before, unlefs Ihe be Lady of the Houfe that denotes the
thing
( 22 )
thing enquired after) and fignifies alfo women in general,
all common vulgar perfons, and if Are doth behold friendly
the fignificator of the matter enquired after, it is an argu-
I
ment that there is great hopes the bufincfs will be pcrformec^
and take elFeft, &c.
t
Of the Nature of S3 and £3
.
(From Cadbury’s Aftrological Thefaurus,)
The S3 is of the nature of "If and ? , bat not fo effeft-
ual, and variable like ^ , and is good with good planets,
[
and evil with ill.
The £3 is of the nature of T? and $ , but not fo interfi-
i
cient or killing ; and contrary to the S3 , for he is evil with
the good planets, and good with the evil, diminifhing the
malice of the evil planets, and abateth the good of the good
planets.
Of the Moon being in Via comlufa.
]) being in Vita combufta, which is from the midll of
sC: to the midft of til; or. under the lun-beams, viz. Com- i
bull; or decreafing in light or motion, and applying to a c5 » I
,
or § of 'b or d' , or by any afpefl, but chiefly by (5 , I
, or § , although the only femidiameter of their beams |
do but behold the femi-beams of the J) , threateneth i
death. . !
!
Example.
A man fick and took his bed the p in the third degree
of TTl decreafing both in light and motion, and d thirteen
degrees in and T? twenty-feven degrees in jf, and
died when P came to the thirteenth degree of )cf
.
Another Example.
Suppofe P in the fourth degree of zt:, and Tj in the
eleventh degree of .cr,' then is P within the Semidiaxneter
of his beams, which is nine degrees in length.
Or
C 23 )
Or if I)
were ten degrees in y , and $ fixteen degrees
n Sl> 5 beholds ^ with a afpeft, which is an
iateful afpeift, yet not fo bad as an g .
But if P were twenty degrees in >f, and T? in eight
[legrecs of <Y’, then fliould P be free from the of T? , be-
. aufe his malice extends no farther than the femidiameter
if his beams, which is but nine degrees, and the true
iiflance of their afpciJl is twelve degrees.
Yet do they afhid the patient when their femidiameters
.lo join or afpe^l, but only the beams of the P , although
It falls not on the body of the P , but this of itfelf is not
snto death ; for the farther the p is from their ^5 or
.fpeil, the lefs they do torment theficlc perfon.
And the nearer P is to the body or afpeft of If or $ ,
pr they to the P , the more they mitigate the pain, and
'
he fooner.
D and § is evil and hateful, and the A and sf; good
and helping, and the (5 is variable good by good planets,
and evil by evil planets, as before is taught.
Therefore if at the hour of falling ficlc the P befreefrom
i , , or g of I7 or d' , the ficlc perfon lhall not die of
chat ficknefs, efpccialiy if the P be in d » A, or to If.
or ? , or that tney intermix their beams with the beams of
rhe P , but lhall foon recover health, efpecially if the P
fee free from combufiion, and increafing in light and mo-
Jtion.
But if the P be then afHifted by the <5 > O , or g of I7
jor S y and efpecially of both ; the patient will die, if nei-
ither If nor ? do behold the P with fome afpeft.
Or if the P be com.buft, if If or ? do not comfort the
P, the patient will die of that difeafe ; and this above is
{general.
As often as the P meeteth with the (5 or afpedl of If pr
? , efpecially by d > A, or the patient lhall be eafed.
And as often as the p is joined by any afpeft of 1? or $ ,
[chiefly by S> or , the patient is pained and tor-
f mented, efpecially upon any critical, judicial, or mortal
[•day.
There-
( 24 )
Tliereforeif by this doftrine it be found by the time he
fell fick, that he (hall die then on the next mortal day thtp-
the D meeteth with the infortunes, or S , and do apply
to them either corpally by (5 , D , of g , raditionally by
(5 or g , then the fick lhall die on that day and hour in
which the 5 cometh to the interfxient point of the zodiac.
But if it be found by the time of his firft falling fick that
he ftiall not die, then at the lirJl time that the 5 doth meet
with 1|. or ?, on a critical, judicial or mortal day, the dif-
eafed perfcn lhall begin to be recovered to his health, :
chiefly if the afpeft be by a, or
And lb much the rather, if the D be free from combuf-
tion, and increaflng in light and motion ; and not in Via
combufi, nor joined to iS

Of ereSling a Figure of Heaven hy the Table of Hci/fcs.
Next I fhall teach the yout^ Student to erefl a f.gure
of heaven by the Table of Houfes hereafter placed;
and it is requifite that he fiiould firll know and confider that
the equinoxial circle is di\ided into 12 equal parts^ meet-
ing at the inierfefUons of the midheaven and afeendant,
thofe being the prime angles of the figure ;
and. there is no-
thing incident to the body of men, but their proper caufes ;
;are fhewn in the horofeope of heaven.
j
It is necefl’ary to remark, that the firft, fourth, feventh, 1
sand tenth houfes are called angles ; two ofwhich fall equally
jupon the horizon, and the other two upon the meridian, . 23
amay be perceived by the globe ;
and thefe are called tlie
jcardinal points or angles of the figure ; thofe that next fol-
Uow thefe principal angles are called fuccedants, or fucced-
«ar.t houfes ; and thofe next to them are termed cadents, or
icadent and falling houfes.
The names and fignifcations of thefe are further illuftrat-
jed in the plate, fgure No. l.
E To
( 26 )
,To erecl your figure by the Table of Houfes, you mud
firft know your certain time of the day you fet your figure
;
for, and gain the degree of the fun’s place in the Ephemeris, /
i to the day propofed, and with thefe degrees enter the Table
I
of Houfes, under the fign you find' the Sun in, and in the
f
loch houfe, againft the degree of the Sun to the left hand,
I
under the title Timefrom Noon, you will find certain hours
j
and minutes ;
unto which if you add the hour and minute
‘
of the day, (reckoning your day from noon to noon), the
j
produft, unlcfs it exceed 24 hours, is to guide you in the
j
fame column (be it either upward or downward) until you find
i
your number, againft which, in the collateral column, you
have the particular cufps of the fix oriental houfes, viz. the
10th, I ith, 1 2th, Afcendant, zd, and 3d; and the other fix
houfes are always oppofite both in figns, degrees and mi-
nutes ; but if your numbers Ihould exceed 24 hours, as fome-
times it will, call away from it 24 hours, and the number
that remains fliall be your guide.
As for Example :

^pj the JigniJications of the fe-ven Planets, their qualifications |
jhapes, dejcriptions and herbs they govern. S
(From Blagrave’s Aftrological Praftice of Phyfic.) '
;
My defign being for brevity, caufes me to omit taking
Notice of any poetical fidlions, of the names of the planets,
'
wor I can give them no other title, they being but the wit- !
l;y inventions, of afpiring pates, and carry a greater fhew
jcf rhetorick than reafon in them : therefore negledling fic-
jiiticus flourilhes, I Ihalh briefly prefent you with the true
jnature and quality of the feven planets, as by experience
It have found', and firll 1 fhall begin with the planet Saturn,
iie being the firfl of the feven, and fo proceed regularly.
The Nature of S NTUR N.
He is the higheft of the feven, and appears to us a flar
!of a pale, leaden, fwarthy colour, and near thirty years fi-
milhing his revolutional circle, and by nature cold and dry,
anafculine ; of the day, and the greater infortune.
Defcripticn. He gives a perfon of a middle llature, fwar-
hhy, pale and muddy complexion, little eyes and unplea-
ifant, down-call look, lownng eye-brows, broad forehead, i
Hat nofe, thick lipsj he goes with his head Hooping, and with
this feet {hoveling, he hathgreat lop ears, black lank, greafy
;or Ihining hair, thin beard, fpare body ;
and is every way !
la heavy, unpleafing, peevilh, melancholy and lumpilh per-
ifon, this of hirafelf ; but you muH mix his or any other pla-
tnets figniiications according as they are conjoined with
lothers. If T? be well dignified, he gives a fober, grave and
tdifcreet perfon in all his adlions, and one very fiudioas ; but
iu iii dignified,, he fignifes a mali-iou', envious, jealous.
( 40 )
t^merous, covetous, and a meer diflemblitig, repining, mir*
truftful, fordid fufpicious fellow, and of an evil difpofition.
Kinds of Men and ProfeJJions. He denotes ancient peopley
as grand-fathers and fathers ; and of profeffions, hufbandmen,
day-labourers, clowns, beggars, plumers, brick- makers,
fcavengers, colliers, gardners, inaulfters, chandlers, cur-
riers, fextons, ndners and tanners, feftaries, dilfenters,
monks, &c. the meaning whereof in a' queftion or nativity
is this, if Saturn be Lord of the firft houfe,. or afcendant,
and in configuration with the fignificators of profeflion, then

I am the larger in defcribing the names and governments
of herbs, becaufe my defign is to annex an Afro-Phyfic;al^

Here you fee Saturn’s orbs are to degrees no minutes,
{the half of which are 5, and Mars’s orbs are 7 deg. 30 min.
Ithe half of which is
3 deg. 45 min. whence it refults, the
cpiatique afpeft of 1? and $ remains until they are 8 deg.
445 min. dillant from their true afpecl.
There are three ways in which planets apply each unto
other.
( 48 )
other. The firft is, when a more fwift plant overtakes |
a more ponderous one; as ^ in 12 deg. of SI, and ^ .
iSofrtii here g being fwifter in motion than Jj is faioi
to apply unto him by a .
The fecond is, when two planets are retrograde, as ? in
in 8 deg. of 55, and !{. in 7 deg. of WR ; here ? applies to
a >H of 1|, by retrogradation.
The third fort of application is, when one planet is di-’
reft, and another retrograde, as J retrograde in 8 deg. of
and 1? in 6 deg. of the fame figndireft; here J be-
ing retrograde, applies to the (5 of 1? , who is direft : the
firfl: of thefe ways is good, the fecond is a moft malignant
application ; the third is not good, nor is it of fo bad a fig-
nification. Note alfo, that the fuperior planets 'b , !{., and
^ are never faid to apply unto any, unlefs they are retro-,
grade ; but the lefler or inferior (as it is among men) makes*
their application unto them.
Separation is when two planets are departed from each
other 6 minutes ; as the O in 10 deg. 10 min. of z:z, and
the 5 in 10 deg. 10 min. of the fame fign, this now is a
perfeft fynod or conjundiion, but when the D lhall come to be
10 deg. and 16 min. of XCC", which is 6 min. diftant, then
Ihe may be faid to be feparated from the ©, yet they can-
not be faid to be totally feparated, until they be clear from
each others rays of half their orbs.
Prohibition ; of which there are two forts. The firft is
when two planets are applying one to the other ; but be-
'
fore they can come to a partial afpeft, another planet, fwift-
er in motion, interpofeth his rays, and prohibites or hinders
the application ; as for example, Tj being in 10 deg. of v,
and ^ in 6 deg. of n, and the © in 5 deg. of n, here $
applies unto b by a , but the © being in 5 deg. of n,
and fwifter in motion than $ , prohibits $ , and comes to
the of b before him. The fecond kind of prohibition is,
when one fignificator is applying to another by body cr
afpedf, becomes retrograde, and fo makes no application
until one of thofe planets are feparated out of thofe figns
they were in, or apply to other planets. Example, fuppofe
^ in 6 deg, of u, and If. 1 deg. of fy, here d' applies
,1
« : I
( 49 )
;to a 5^« of %, but before he comes to his true il(, falls re-i
rtrograde, and fo is prohibited, and this fort of prohibition iaij
rtermed refrenaiion. _ _
.
Tranjlation of Light and Nature, is when a lighter planet i j
cfeparates from a more weighty one, and prefently joins tojj
ianother more heavy or ponderous, as $ in 26 deg. of
? in 27 deg. and 'll in 29 deg. of the fame fign ; here ?
Ifeparates from a (5 of ^ , and applies immediately to a (5 ^
lof 'll, and fo tranflates the light and virtue of $ untoi
ihim : it is performed as well by afpedl as body, after the !
ifame manner. 1
ColleSlion of Light is when two planets are not in afpedl oneJ
with another, but both call their afpedls to a more ponderousn
tor weighty planet than themfelves, and they both received s
Ihim in fome of their efhitial dignities. \
Reception, is when planets are in each other’s dignities^jj
ihoufe, exaltation, triplicity and term ;
as If. in y , and ? |
iin X ; here If. and ? are in reception by houfe, and know ij
Jthat this is the bell fort of reception. -j
Secondly, by exaltation, as ? in $ in K> and this;)
iis a good reception alfo. • \
Thirdly, it may be by triplicity, as ? in v, and the O
iin Vf ; and this is good, though not fo excellent as the J
iformer.
|
Fourthly, by term, thus d' in 16 deg. of n, and ? 24!
deg. of «Y' ; here S and ? are in reception by term ;
and
|
mote, this is the meanell of receptions, yet half a loaf is bet- {
Uer- than no bread. ;
Peregrination. A planet is faid to be peregrine, or a
ia ftranger, when he is out of all his effential dignities, as ]
fthe O in 2S is peregrine, becaufe he has no elTential dig- •
mities in the fign throughout, or the 5 in the ligns Si and
’
'T, where he hath no fortitude, and therefore peregrine
lalfo.
h'oid of Courfe, is when a planet is feparated from one
j
planet, and does not apply or meet with the body or afpedl
:of another during the time he remained in the fign they are
^ofited ; and this happens often to the D , by reafon of her
tfwift .motion, who is reputed weak when void of courfe.
C 50 >
Ha'ix., is when a mafculine and diurnal planet is above
'
he earth, in a tnafculine fign ;
and fo when a feminine and
^
lofturnal planet, in the night, is in a feminine fi^n.
'
Combufiion, is when a planet is within 8 deg. 30 min. of
the body of the G in the fame fign, either before or after
aim, as the G in 10 degrees of SI and ? in i deg. and
jp min. of SI, here ? is entering combuftion ; and note,
iibat a planet is more afRifted when he is applying to, than
teparating from combuftion.
C(^hm, or in the heart of the G, corde folis, is when a
ialanet is not removed above 17 min. from the G> either
tejbefore or after him ;
and all Aftrologers hold, a planet forti-
iiied by (being cordefolis) fo pofited under the G’s beams,
jla planet is, until he is fully elongated from him 1 5
deg.
I
Dircdion, is when a planet moves forward in a fign, viz, v
I
from 1 deg. to 2, 3, &c.
I
Retrogradaiion, is when a planet moves backward, or
iagainft the wonted fucceffion, or order of the figns, as from
1
10 deg. to 9, 8, &c.
,1 u A
Stationary, is when a planet moves not at all, but itanas.
dlill in the heaVens, which is ufual with the fuperior pla-
nets, , %,zr.d $ , three or four days together, • before
iretrogradation or diredtion.
Note, That G and D , always move forward, or by di-
reftion.
Oriental, is when a planet rifeth before the G*
Oe^idental, is when a planet fetteth after the G .
B^eged, is when a planet -is between the bodies of two
planets, as $ in 5 deg. of “Y*, $ in 3 deg. and b tti
7 deg.
of the Ihme fign ;
here ^ ts befieged of T? and d' •
,
Longitude of a liar or planet is his diftance from the be-
ginning of 'Y’
. ^
Longitude of a place, is reckoned in the equator eaft-
ward, till it end where it firft began, in 360 degrees,
which is the greateft longitude.
_
.,
Latitude of a ftar or planet, is his diftance from the eclip-
tic, either north or fouth, and. the latitude of a place its
diftance from the equator.

iind find the hour of the day underneath, againft which, in
ihe firll column, towards the left hand, you have your de-

Example.
I find Saturday in the ninth column, and_ guide my eye
downward until 1 find four, and agcinfl it, in the firlf co-
lumn to the left hand, I find Sol, which informs me that th^
Sun rules the hour enquired after.
Note, if you would know the planet ruling the hour of
the night, then againft your number found in the column
to the right hand, as the title diredb you, you have your

For the encouragement of young Students, that are not
furnifhed with the tables of the fun’s rlfing or fetting in any
latitude, which is necefiary to be known ; I fh^ll here brief-
ly (hew you how it may be performed by the Doarine of
Triangles. The Rule is briefly thus :
Js Radius, orfign of go degrees, is to the Tangent ofDeclin-
ation ; fo is the Tangent of the Latitude of the placeyou eae in, to
the Sign of the Sun’s Setting in degrees.
_
^
Which may be converted into time, allowing to every
fifteen degrees, one hour ofitime, or to every degr^ee four
minutes of time, and to every four minutes ef tune agrees
one minute of time, knowing the length of each planetary
hour; add it to the hour of Sun rifmg, (heweth when the
firft planet ends his cube, or the firll hour, and with a con-
tinual ad^tion of the minutes belonging to a planetary
hour, yoatnay knpw what planet governs any hour of the
day.
Example. *,
If on a Monday the Sun fett at feven o’clock, and four*
teen minutes paft, fubtraa it from twelve hours, leaves the
time of Sun-Rifing, viz. 4 hours, 46 minutes, the length of
the planetary hour is found to be 90 minutes, or one hour 30
minutes ;
which added to 4 hours, 46 minutes, makes 6 Imurs
16 minutes, for the time of the firlt p
anetaryhour on Mon-
day ; then to 6 hours 16 minutes, add one hour 30 minutes,
gives the time of ending the fecond planetary hour tq be 7
hours 46 minutes, to which again, add one hour 30 minure :
gives you the third planetary hour ended, and fo of the

Of the Signifientors, of the Qnerent and Quefited.
1
The Qnerent is that perfon (be it either man or woman)
;'.at propounds the doubt or quefiion to the artiff, and the
Scendant his lord, and the }) are the proper figniticators of !
ne Querent. The Quefited is the perfon or thing enquired *
Ifter, as for exmaple, in varying a figure according to the
natter or thing propounded : -fnppofe a man enquire concern- i
ng his brother, or fome fmall journey ; the firll houfe (as be- |
ore) his lord and th^ D are for the Querent ; but the third
oui'e, with the lord thereof, and planets therein, (if any)
;re for the brother, brethren, or fmall journey. If concern- '
mg a father, land or inheritance, the fourth cufp thereof,
vith its lord, are fignificators : if of children, the 5th, i
3c^ :
if of fervants or fmall cattle, the 6th ; if of a hufband, ::
-fife or fweet-heart, cfr. the 7 th ; and fo of the reft.
’
To kno--w n-vhen a Figure is Radical, andfitfor Judgment.
Firft, if the fign afeending, or the lord of the afeendant
.^nd planets therein, l^c. do truly deferibe the Querent,
ihen is the queftion fit to be judged.
zdly. When in a queftion, either the very beginning, or
tatter end of a fign afeend, it is not fafe to give judgment,
j
for if the beginning of a fign afeends, the queftion is im- ^
oroper'y propounded ; if t.He latter end thereof afeend, the
Querent has either been tampering with others about the
matter, or the queftion is forged.
3dly, When the moon is in a Combujla, the combuft way,
er void of courfe, the matter propounded goes unluckily on;
therefore at iuch times, let the artirt defer his judgment.
4th!y, The moon, or lord of the afeendant,, in oppoficioti
'
( S6 )
the lord of the feventh houfe (which fignifies the artift)
|
the Qqerent may then be concluded a knave, or fool, or j
both, and comes to abufe both the art and artift, at which)
time, Jay to tftem (as 1 ufually do) " Friend, I find, .
“ fffc. that the matter propounded is not ferious, and there-
“ fore, if you will trouble me for yoiir pleafure, firft fatisfy ;
“ me for my pains,” and they will immediately retire.
And Note, That if the 7th houfe be afflifted, or its lord
retrograde or combuft, (except the matter propounded re-
lateth thereto) the aftrologer doth (by giving judgment
at fuch times) difgrace both the art and himfelf ; and if he
adventureth to judge, the more difcrcdit he is liable to,
which is the meaning of Ptolomy’s words, ^antis in errori-
bns verfatiir Aftrologus cum locus feptimus ac ejus Dominus aff.icl-
5
ierunt. Ptol. Centiloq; Aphor, 14.
6thly, When Saturn is in the afcendant of a queftlon, and
infortunate, the matter propounded, is either falfe, or with-
out ground, otherwife paftall hope, and if at the fame time,
the lord, of the afcendant be combuft or retrograde, the que-
rent is either a knave or a fool,
i
ythly. When the teftimonies in your figure are equal, the
matter propounded ought not to be judged, by reafon the
s
artift then knows not which way the fcales may turn, therc-
J fore ought to defer judgment till a more proper time.
I
Sthly, Some authors hold the queftion to be radical, when
j
the lord of the afcendant, and lord of the hour, are of one
i
nature and triplicity, which is thus known ; fuppofe af- /
I
cend at the time of the queftion, and $ happen to be lord
i of the hour, here the queftion will be found radical, be-
'
caufe the G who is lord of the afcendant and $ , are of one
nature, nsisc. hot and dry; or if at the fame time, Jupiter
happen to be lord of the hour, the queftion will then be radi-
cal, in regard 'll. is of the fame triplicity with the G , and
j
fo of the reft.
Of the PoJJlbility, or Impojflbility ofthe matter propounded,
Whatfoevcr is propounded, carrieth in the face thereof.
both a negative, and an affirmative, that is to fay, it mav^
I either be brought to pafs by a wiffied conclufion or not, fori
: all things under the Sun are contingent. {
ill. Matters are brought to pafs divers ways, (viz.)
• when the planets fignifying the perfon propounding ;
and
:the perfon or thing enquired after, are going to Conjunc-
ition, Sextile or Trine, to each other in good places of the
I figure, and fometimes by tranflation or colleftion of light
;
lor by the dwelling in houfes or dignities.
adly. When the fignincators apply to a Conjun<5lion in
lan angle, the bufinefs may be brought to pafs ; if the fig-
mificator of the thing promifed, be fortified, and apply to
ihe lord of the aicendant, the matter or thing will be
tbr.Tught to pafs.
Now as I have (hewed the poffibility of bringing things
lo pafs ; it is requifite 1 (hew the impo(ubility, which is
(known from thefe following aphorifms.
ill, If the fignificators of the querent and quefited are not
beholding each other, it is an argument the thing enquir-
ed after will not be brought to perfection.
zdly. When the fignificators (hall behold each other from
ihateful places of the figure, or (liall be in a or § of the
anfortunes, it is feldom known that upon fuch politions, any
ithing be brought to a good conclufion.
3d!y, When the fignificators a.-e combufi, cadent, or void
of reception, it is a miracle if they -bring anv thing to per-
ifeClion, when either the infortunes, or cauUa draconis, (hall
located in the houfe fignifying the thing enquired after,
ihe bufinefs will be brought to an unprofperous end.
Ofthe perfon or matter impeding or furthering the htfnefs.
When in your figure you find an obftruClion or further-
lance of your bufinefs, obferve the planet impediting or ad-
jjuvant, and the houfe or houfes where he or (he governs
;
fend fay the ktt or furtherance (hall come from fuch a per-
i(bn or thing, fignilied by the houle or houfes he or (he doth,
govern
;
Example.
of the 3d, fay a brother or klnfman will be the occafion of
the good or evil portended in the bufinefs ; if he be lord of
the 2d, fay that money or want thereof, will either help or .
hinder it ; he that underftands this rule, cannot be to feek
in the refolution of any queftion, and he that underftands it
not, is not fit to judge any thing of this nature.
To knovj %vhen, or in ivhat time, a hufinefs may be performed.
Take the diftance between the two fignificators, either
by body or afpeft, and turn it into time thus
:
If the fignificators are in moveable figns, and fwift in
motion, look how many degrees of diftance you have, for
ib many days it will be ; if flow in motion, fo many weeks
;
if in common figns, and flow in niotion, it will be fo many
months, if fwift, fo many weeks ; if they be in fixt figns,
and flow in motion, it will be fo many years, if fwift fo
many months as you have diftance.
Note, Angles are equivalent to moveable figns ; fucceed-
ents to common or corporal ; cadent to fixed ; the ufe
whereof, is this, when you find the diftance of the fignifica-
tors, and in angles, you may be the more pofitive of the
fpeedy performance of the bufinefs, when you fee the great
probability of the performance of bufinefs, and the fignifica-
tors immediately applying to a Conjunftion or good af-
pedl ;
then for the true time of pierformance, oblerve the
'
day of the faid Conjundlion or afpedl ; this is an excellent
rule, not vulgar with aftrologers, that.. 1 have often found
true by experience. '
I
Of the Moles and Marks of the ^erent and ^eftcd, and hew
to find them.
The knowledge of moles or marks are a good way to
verify your figure, and prove it radical, for if the moles,
Wr. correfpond with the fcheme or figure erefled, the ar-
lift may with fafety, proceed to judgment. The rules follow
:
1 . Having eredled your figure, confider tlie fign afcend-
ing, and on the member reprefented thereby, tell the Que-
rent he hath .a mole, mark or (kar:
EKample,,.
Example. i
Suppofe r afcend, and $ the lord thereof above the
|
earth, the querent hath a mole or mark on his face; if « ,
|
X)n his neck or throat, i5c.
|
2 . Obferve what fign the lord of the afcendant is in, for i
DU that member the Querent hath another mole. Confider I
nlfo the lord of the 6th, with the cufp thereof, for in thofe
|
members the Querent is alfo marked : likewife, obferve the
place of the moon, for the Querent hatk another mole, and I
r.he more certain, if Ihe be affliifted ; if the planet and^ fign
|
ifignifying the mark or mol? be mafculine, the mark, ijjc. is i
on the right fide of the body ; if feminine, on the left : if
ihe fignificator of the mole, IsSc. be above the earth, the
mark or mole, ^r. is then vifible to the eye and on the
:he forepart of the body ;
but if he be under the earth,
lit is not then to be feen, but is on the back-part of the bo-
By. If few degrees afcend on the horefcope, or defcend on
5he 6th, or if the lord of the afcendant, lord of the 6th houfe,
and the moon be in the beginning of figns, then judge the
•moles, to be in the upper part of that member repre-
flented. If they or either of them, be in the middle of figns,
ihen the marks or moles, are in the middle of the member ;
but if they be in latter degrees of the figns, you may be con-
itident, that the moles, i3c. are on the lower parts of the
member.
Note, If an infortune be In the afcendant of any queftion
ihe face of the querent is ufually blemilhed ; for the face
is always fignified by the firft houfe, let any fign whatfbever
afcend ; and this 1 have very often experimented.
Thefe rules have the fame fignification upon the body of
ttheQuefited; as for example, Suppofeone Ihouldenquireofa
Mweetheart or wife, &c. the yth houfe will be her firft, the
ttwelfth her fixth, and according as the figns and their lords ^
are pofited, fo judge as you did for the querent, as to marks
a’iid moles ; and indeed upon any other account.

T is an obfervation mod true, that all people endued j
with reafon, are felicitous to know their feature eftate {
land condition ; but a? fome perfons find it impofli{)le to pro- ;
)cure the exaft time of their birth, aftrology fupplies that J
idefefl, by the doftrine of Horary Queftions. So that from
la queftion ferioufly propounded, alraoft as much fatisfaftion j
may be given the querent, upon many fubjedts of enquiry,
as if his nativity were adtually known. For as the nativity
is the time of the birth of the body, the horary queftion is
the time of the birth of the mind; and there are few per-
fons living but what are in fome way or other fubjeft to
horary doubts, which being ferioufly propounded in the
I
fhape of a queftion, may be fatisfaftorily refolved. This
! dodrine feems to be founded upon that miraculous fympa-
I
thy in nature, which is admirably raanifefted between the ^
i
moon and the fea; by which, that amazing body of water |
'
is conftantly drawn after her, though no man fees, or can
;
conceive how. In thefe fympathies there can be no doubt ^
j
but the vegetive foul of the world invifibly carries and
;
unites a fpecific virtue from the heavens between one thing, ;
'
and another, every where working thofe fecret effedls, which
;
no mortal can fail to admire. And in the prefent cafe, who i
:
is to determine what this foul cannot effedl between the
'
heavenly bodies and the animal fpirit of man, working fuch i
fympathies, as that a queftion of Importance to our welfare
: cannot ftart from the mind, but in a point of time when the ,
planets and figns governing the perfon’s birth, are afling
( )
;pon the very rubjefl that engages his thoughts and atten-
ton. And hence the birth of the queftion, like the nati-
iity of a child, carries the ftory of the whole matter in hand,
ipon its forehead. And hence arifes that Ikill in natural
rredidtions, by which the artiJl is enabled to demonllrate
tie particulars of the ct'ent required ; and this as well by
ne liars of heaven, as Abiather the priell was of old en-
ibied to do by the liars of the Ephod.
But, however, the predidlions that are made from the
uellionary way, are by no means fo perfect and correft as
hofe deduced from nativities, and therefore I recommend
111 judgments on futurity to be made from nativities, when
;iey can be prqcured, rather than from horary queftions.
3ut at the fame time I am very confident that the omni-
xient Creator is not at all wanting for any pollible care in
is contrivance of the works of nature, for the fupply of all
ur moderate wants and enquiries. And if it be effential
:o man’s welfare to be forewarned of the time and the judg-
ment, as Solomon declares it is, and that the wife manjhall
\nvw it •, then it is plain that God has alForded means to
ibtain this knowledge w'ithout a miracle ; and this means
ciay furely be by the liars of heaven, refponding cur horary
iiuelllons, and experience continually affirms day by day
that it is fo. Not that I believe the' trivial concerns and
iccidents of mankind, as feme writers have pretended, as if
glove loll or hidden in fport and wantonnels, Ihould be fo
x'atched and attended by the heavenly intelligencers, that
rhey mull needs point out where this'piece of leather were
CO be found ; or that queftions propounded out of mere cu-
iiofuy or diverfion, are to be refolved by them. No, God’s
|/orks are ferious, and not to be made the fport and ridi-
lule of the gay and inconfiderate. For although the hea-
Tcnly contrivance may aptly refpond our ferious and im-
BOrtant concerns, as when David anxioully defired to know
whether he Jhould go up into any if the cities ofJudah, and which
'fthem? yet that they Ihould as aptly fatisfy our intempe-
late defires, and be fubfervient to our frolicks, is too ridi-
lulous to imagine. There is no doubt but the heavens are

able
( 62 )
able to fliew us more learning than we mortals, in this ftate
of frailty and corruption, can ever attain to underftand
;
and it is a great bounty of God that we know fo much)*^
,
as we do ;
therefore it highly becomes very wife and
good man,to glorify the maker of all things for the little know-
ledge he can and doth attain, and to be careful how he
fports even with the leaft among his gracious works.
All enquiries that are ferious, and that come under the
denomination, of an horary queftion, muft neceflarily relate
'
either to things pojl, prefent , or to come ; or to concerns that
OHce nowo dt'Cy or mciy he hcceuj'tei j and the anfwer to
fuch queftions mult be either or araVew/fl/. The ef-
fential anfwer is always one of the three things following,
to wit, that the matter concerning which the enquir)’ is
made, is, firft, to be, or not to be-, fecond, either good, or bad ;
and third, either true ox falfe. Therefore, if the queltion '
I
be real, and the matter rightly ftated, the true anfwer,
*
which is always Ihort, will be eafily difcovered by the fol-
lowing rules. The accidental anfwer, is that vvhich apper-
i
tains to the accidents of the bufinefs in hand ; and is always
! defined by nuhc'c, ^xben, ho^x, or ^jjhy.
^
And whoever at-
tempts to extend his judgment beyond thefe limits, ftrains
; art beyond its bounds, and forces it to fpeak that which it
i is totally incapable of, and by this means many pretenders
j
to Aftrology fail egregioufly in their undertakings. To
! avoid this, let the following queries be attended to :
questions proper for the FIRST HOUSE.
Whether the ^erent may enjoy Health, long Life, vfTc.
1 In the refolutlon of this queftion, you muft obferye the
'
fign afeending, the lord thereof, and the Moon, and if you
i find them free from the ill afpefts of Saturn and Mars, or
•,
the lords of the fixth, eighth, fourth, and twelfth houfes,
;
and they free from combuftion,. and fwift in motion, theiC
i are certain tellimonies of a long life, provided the laid fig-
^
i nificators bj not afiiiaed by the prefence of violent fixed
1 ,
liar?
;
•
iftars; but if the lord- of the afcendant be combuft, retro- j
lerade, or in fquare or oppofition to the infortunes, or lord
<of the fourth, eighth, fixth, or twelfth, and this in an evil
|
•place of heaven, you may truly judge that the querent is 1
ihckly and (hort lived; efpecially if !{. , © , and $ be weak and 1
lafliifted; the manner and time thereof fltall be demonftrated
tin the judgment of the eighth houfe. I
Of the Good or E-vil attending the ^erent during Life.
_
1
. When fortunate planets are in the afcendant or the prin-
|
icipal places of the figure, they denote much good unto the I
iquerent, during the future part of his life, provided they be n
lin good afpeft of the Moon, and ihe applying W thofe af-
ipedfs ; but if Ihe be fcparating, it fhews what is paft, ac-
j cording to the nature of the alpefk, be -it either good or
levil ; as forinflance, if Saturn be in the afcendant, and af-
tflift the Moon or Lord of the afeendaru, the querent will
-ibe melancholy and penfive, and fubjeflto vexations and
Itroubles from aged men, &c. If Mars, he will be choleric,
and ofien be opprefled by thieves and .knaves, and many
: times fufFers by treachery of kindred, or by pretended
:friend(h!p; if the S be there, he is feldom free from fcan-
. dal and difgrace. .
Have great regard to the houfes thefe afHifling planets
i govern, for from thence is known by what means the que-
"rent fhall be fortunate or unhappy.
ih'hat time the Natme or Querent may expert a Change.
When a ferious queftion of this nature is propounded,
having credited a figure, I draw it into a fpeculum (as in a
nativity) and diredil the fignificators to their feveral pro-
. mittors. Then having the true diftance of each fignifica-
' tor, from his promittor, I convert the degrees and minutes
into time, as in a nativity, and according to the effects of
direftions, I ufually judge thereof; but this method ison-
I
ly neceflary when a nativity cannot be obtained, and the
:
queftion of weighty concernment, and not upon light and
.> ordinary bufinefs.
But in queftions of indllFerency, or of trivial concern-;
E oient, you may obferve the jdegrees of diftance between |
the,
the fignificators by body or afpedts, and judge certain
enough.
^
What Part of the ^erenPi Life is like to he hef. ^
To refolve this queftion, you muft note what part of the
figure the fortunate liars are in, and according to their po-
lition judge thereof.
If fortunate planets be in the afcendant, in the twelfth,
or eleventh houfe, the querent will be moll happy and for-
tunate in his infancy or younger years ; if in the tenth,
ninth, or eighth, the good fortune will happen in the fecond
part of his age ; if in the feventh, lixth, or fifth houfe, it
will happen after his middle age ; if in the fourth, third,
and fecond, his latter age will be moll happy.
Some authors (and thofe of good credit too) hold, that
in this manner of judgment, we ought to allow to every ^
houfe the fortunate planets are diftant from the afcendant *
\
five years, and accordingly judge of the time of the querents
happy and fortunate Hate.
I
And when in a quellion you find the fignificators of life
' are llrong, and fignify long life, you may add one year to
I
every houfe, for it is then more than probable the querent
! may live more than 6o years.
I
Ttrward nuhat Part of the World may the ^iuerent direS his
j
Courfe to prefper.
I
Note, that the whole heaven is divided into four quar-
I
ters, viz, Ea(l, Well, North, and South. Thefe four |P
,
quarters are again fubdivided, as the firll houfe Eall ; the
;
twelfth houfe Eall by South ; the eleventh is South-eall
;
I
the tenth or mid-heaven is South, &c.
!
And according to the quarters of heaven thus divided
I
and fubdivided, you arp to mind in which of thefe places
!
you find If, ?, D , 0, or the major part of them, and
i
direct the querent in his affairs thither.
Example.
Suppofe the faid promifing planets be found in the mid-
!
heaven or tenth-houfe, direfl the querent fouthward, if
< )
they be in the ninth, t"11 him it is bed to fouth-wft; i
,
in the feventh, it is good fcr him to go full weft i
OjferVi

Alfo, confider ferioufly the nature of the queren s deftre,
whether it be for health, rches, honour, friends, tffr. Fo; ^
by rightly underftanding the queftion, you lhall anfwer thti
querents defire more readily, >,

If it be for health of body he would remove his habitation

Iftne perfon have a mind to /peak nvith another, ’whether hi
Jhallfind him at home P
I have found great variety in this queftion, the whicli
did (in part) engage my thoughts to thiswiricomparablc ftu-j
dy ; at firft cauilng me to conclude, that if there were fdif
great certainty in fo mean a queftion, there might be mucli',
more found in matters of greater worth ; without, furtheqj
anticipation, the rules are as followeth, viz. 1
1 . If you would fpeak with a perfon that you have fa-H
miliar and conftant dealings with, and he no ways related)!
unto you. |i
Take the feventh houfe and his lord, to fignify him, I^j
mean the feventh from the afcendant, for the afcendant al4'
v,'ays< fignifies the querent. And if the lord of the feventlti|
be in any of the four angles, as the firft, fourth, feventh cr|
tenth houfes, the perfon you would then -fpeak with is atp

If the lord of the feventh be in the fecond, fifth, eighthij
or eleventh houfes, he is not then at home, but is nearl
home, and may be fpoke with, yet not without diligence. j|
But when the lord of the feventh is in the third, fixth,
ninth, or twelfth houfe, (they bclnp- cadent) you may theni
. t'-lll
. (

tell the querent, that the perfon he would fpeak with, is
•
far from home, and cannot be fpoke with.
But if the lord of the afcendant, apply to the lord of the
feventh, by a friendly afpeft, you may then tell the que- iV
rent, that he may meet the quefited as he is going, or hear
of him by the way, by one means or other ; or if the J , or
any other planet, transfer the light of the lord of the fe-
i venth, to the lord of the afcendant, it denotes the fame.

Then obferve the nature and fex of the planet fo transfer-
i ring light, fignifies what manner of perfon (hall give no-
'
tice to the querent ( f the faid party, but then regard
ought to be had to the fign and quarter, fuch fignificator
is pofited in.
And further note, if you would fpeak with a relation, >
i
you muft not then take the lord of the feventh houfe, but
the lord of that houfe fignifying fuch relation: as, if a .
brother, then look to the lord of the third ; if he be a fa- .
ther, have regard to the lord of the fourth ; if a fon or
daughter, then take notice of the lord of the fifth, and
judge of their pofitions as aforefaid.
Ifan ahfent perfon be dead or ali-ve ?
Firft you are to confider what relation the querent hath
to the quefited, and accordingly take your fignificator ; but
if there be no relation between them, take the afcendant .
;
his lord, and the D to fignify the party that is abfent, and
judge as followeth. p
,
If the lord of the afcendant or I> , be in conj unction with
1
the lord of the eighth, or a planet in the eighth, and no
good teftimonles to the contrary, the abfent party is dead.
When the J and lord of the afcendant fhall be in oppo-
fiiion to the lord of the eighth, from the fecond and eighth,
or from the fixth and twelfth houfes, the abfent party is
dead.
Or if the lord of the afcendant be In the fourth, and the
3> in the feventh, in to him there, it Ihcws great dan-
ger to the quefited, if not death*, or when an evil planet
tri.nf1ates die light of the lord of the eighth, unto the lord

Mr Gadbury fayeth, that if the lord of the afcendant o
Mooh, be in the fourth fromthe afcendant, or in the eightl,
houfe, and there combuft in their falls, or joined with thn
lord of the eighth, the quefited party i^ dead.
Butif none of thefe happen, and you find the D theafeen
danr, and his lord fortified, then fay the abfent party is no
only aliie but well and in good health.
If the lorl of the afcendant or moon, feparate from th'

of the eighth, he hath been in danger of death ; if from th{
lord of the twelfth, he hath been in prifon, or in dango

Arguments of Danger.
1. The evil influence of S is dimini(h®d ;
when neither
in the M. C. nor eleventh : when $ is pofited there the
veflcl w 11 be deftroyed by pirates: if the afcendant is art|
fiifled by any martial fixed ilar, the fhip will be burned.
2. The fignificators weak and afflidtcd of the malevolent i
in ill houfes : much danger attends that ihip, and all thing*
and perfons in her, or belonging to her, if not a total lofs
of them and the fhip too.
% The affliaing liars in the afcendant having dignities
in the eighth, or the lord of the afcendant be pofited in the
8th, or in evil ray to the lord of the 8t’n, 6th, I2th, or 4th,
denotes lofs or ruin of the velTel. and ah things in her or
any great hazard thereof: for (he cannot be fuccefsful to
commander or Tea men. _
A The ]) under the Sun beams, or in the combull way, or
otherwife afflicdcd under the earth, threatens great dangef
or mislortune to attend fuch ftnp.
j u 1 j f
c The afcendant and 5 unfortunate, and the lord ot
the afcendant llrong and well pofited, denotes the (hip to be
in a bad condition, and encounters many misfortunes .
yet
her loading and the men in her, will do well, and come off
without much prejudice.

nified by that fign the affliaiag planet is in.
7 If it be Tj ,

be fplit or funk before it has performed any confiderable
fervice : the voyage very inaufpicious and in great danger
of finking or running into fand, or fplitting and the like :
and the men either drowned or fubjeft to much forrow and
hardlh^^-e
^ ^ and ^ eflentially dig-
nified, or afpefting a place where he hath power, or pofited
in an earthy fign, portends the fame as yet with greater
violence, and before the cataftrophe of the veffel, many re-
markable and various troubles to happen to the Ihip.
9 If ^ afflia the lords of the chief angles, and the dil-
(70 '
lofitor of the S , denotes the men in the ihip to be in very
Tcat dread of their enemies.
10. If there alfo happens other arguments of evil, itde-
ctes quarreling, controverfy, wounds, and feveral thefts
Dmmitted among the men in the ihtp, and thereby giving
Ilvantages to their enemies ; chiefly if $ be in figns re-
-refenangthe upper part of the fhip, the men therein will
Kfraud each other.

nefts and knavery : and fundry of the aforefaid mifchiefs,
let not fo violent, for Tj will vent his malice in rendering
ne voyage troublefome and tedious, yet there will be no
iloodfhed in that vefl'el.

the rocks, &c. either greatly dillrefs or deftroy the fame, i
if the lord of the 1 2th concur in lignification, tedious cap-
iivity will attend her.
13. ^ in human figns denotes the Ihip to be burned by
ihe power and fury of her enemies in fight, if $ is lord of
ihe 7th, or by accident of feme of the men within her, and
It begins in that part of her fignified by the fign or place
iS is in.
13. If Ij as faid of $ and in the M. C. the (hip then
will either be funk or much damaged by violent winds and
weather, bad fails &c. and the prejudice will be greater or
seder according to the dignity or debility of and $ and
uis remotion from or propinquity to the fortunate flars.

thereof, and many other infelicities to the fliip and perfonj
iuid things therein. <
16. Lord of the afcendant, the ]) and her depofitory
and the lord of the 9th, flow in motion, denotes very long
and tedious voyages of little profit to the owners, more fo^
if the lords of the angles be flow alfo.
17. If there be einnity between the lord of the afcendant
and depofuor.of the 5 , and no reception happen beween
them, nor any affiftance from the benevolent planets, the
feamen or mariners contend or quarrel with each other
great difeord, grumbling, and murmuring between the
captain or mailer, and them, and they whofe fignificator is the

ceflaries for feamen and paflengers ; if in watery figns, a
Scarcity of water fit for their ufe : if in earthy or airy figns,,
the want of viftuals and forcing will caufe much trouble

QUESTIONS belonging to the SECOND HOUSE. 1
«
S^all tht ^erent be Rich or Poor ?
To anfwer this queftion, you muft obferve the fign of the
decond hpufe and his lord, the planets that are therein, thofe
that call their afpeds thither, or to the lord thereof, the 0,
his place, and difpofiter.
Firjl, When you find all the fignificators free, or the ma-
L jot
( 74 •)
jpr part of them, and well-afpeded by the fortunes, you
may conclude the querent will attain to a competent degree
of wealth ; but if you find all the fignificators afflidled, and
the fortunes noways alTifting, you may fay (and that pofi-
tively too) that the perfon enquiring will be very poor moft
part of his life.
If the lord of the afcendant or Moon (hall be with the
lord of the houl'e of fubftance, or the lord of the houfe of
fubftance (orfecond hcufe) be in the afcendant, or if the lord
of the afcendant or Moon be placed in the fecond houfe, or
if the Moon or any other good planet, lhall transfer ,
the
light of the lord of the fecond to the lord of the afcendant,
or of the lord of the afcendant to the lord of the fecond,
the querent fhall then attain riches, and live in good credit,
according to his quality of birth.
And if none of thefe teftimonies happen, obferve If,, who
is naturally a fignificator of nches, or ? , who is a fortune,
or Q ,
who is of the nature of the fortunes ; and if they be
free from the ill beams of the malevolent, or happen to be
pofited in the houfe of fubftance, the querent will affuredly
be rich, and live in very good repute.
But when T? > S , or ^ fhall be in the fecond houfe, or
afRift the lord of the fecond, If, ? , 0, denotes the que-
rent lhall not attain riches; and if any inheritance fall to
his lot, he will fquander it away, and be fuddenly reduced
to want and penury, and live very obfcurely.
The fignificators of fubftance, fwift in motion, and in
good places of the figure, and free from all manner of af-
fliftion, the querent will attain to riches, and that fuddenly,
but if flow in motion (though not alHidled) riches comes
hut flowly, efpecially if the planets fignifying riches, be in
fixed ligns.

n
By nvhat Means Jhall the Riches he had ?
FIrft, oblerve the fignificators of the fubftance, and their
feveral pofitions, as alio the houfes they govern, for from
thence is known by what means riches come.
If the lord of the fecond, or other fignificators of fub-
ftance, be fortunately placed in the afcendant, the querent
will
'
( 75 )
'
will attain riches without much labour, or at lead unexpeft-
edly ;
but if the lord of the fecond be in che fecond, he lhall
gain wealth by his own induftry. |
If the cufp of the fecond, or its lord, or 0, or its difpo^
litor, or If. be in the afcendant or houffe of fubftance, or the''
planets in good afpedl to thefe places, and the llcongeft of,
them in watery figns, denotes gain by trading to fea, or in
matters relating to the water. j”
If the fignificators be pofited in fiery figns, they prornife
gain by fome trade that relates to fire, as a chymift, inftru-j
ment-maker, barber, fmith, &c. I
If in airy figns, fignifies wealth got by Ingenuity, or
without much labour, fometimes mufic, dancing, finging/
hunting, hawking, fowling, &c.
'
The earthy figns fignify fome ordinary trade, or one of
more labour, as hufbandry, hedging, ditching, coal-mer-'
chants, miners, &c.
j
If 0 be in the 8tli or his difpofitor, or lord of the fecondj
be there well dignified, and in good afpeft with the lord of]
the afcendant or the Moon, denotes riches, legacies, andj
gifts from perfons deceafed, or by marriage ; the lord on
the 8th in the loth, in good afpeft with the lord of the af-j
s Cendant, or fecond, or cufp thereof, promife increafe of|
>
wealth from the wills of the dead, and if 'b be fignificator,j
it is lands; if 1^, money ; if ? , rich houfehold-ltuff, andj
fb of the reft.
If the J. be ftrong in the fecond, ftie promifeth riches,
but if weak and affl'ided, judge the contrary, and according-
ly judge of the reft of the planets as they are ftrong or weak.
7he Time when Riches may he ExpeBed.
Obferve the application of the D , or lord of the afcend-
ant to the fignificators of wealth ;
and by their diftance is
! known when the querent’s riches will come.
For if you ferioufly take notice of the degrees of diftance
between the fignificators, and turn them .into time : thus,
; if in moveable figns, fo many degrees of diftance between
fignificators, either by body or afpeft, then fo many weeks
I or days will it be before it happens; if in common figns, fo
L 2 many
t 76 )
many montha or weeks, if in fixed figos, fo many years op
months, according as you find the fignificators pofited ;
for
angles are equivalent to moveable figns ;
fucceedents to
common ;
cadent to fixed.
But the moft affured way is this (as I have often experi-
mented) to take the right or oblique afcenfions of your
fignificators, and direft them (as in a nativity) to their fe-
veral promittors, for this is the only way of finding the
time of obtaining riches, but if the queltion be of a par-
ticular fum of money, obferve the degrees of diftance, and
account your time by years, months or days, as aforefaid.
I
Shall the Querent obtain the Money lent?
The lord of the afcendant and ]) are fignificators of the
querent, and the lord of the fecond, his fubftance or any
thing lent. But the, yth hbufe and his lord, fignifies the
;perfon that owes you the goods or money, and the 8th
houfe and his lord denotes his fubfiance.
Therefore mind if the lord of the afcendant or D be
ioined to the lord of the 8th, and fee if either of them be
joined to, or in good afpedl 'with a planet in the 8ih, and
the planet therein happens to be a fortune, the querent will
then obtain the money enquired after.
And if it happen that an infortune be either in the 8th,
;
or with the lord of the 8th, and he either receive the lord
of the afedndant or 5 , the perfon fhall obtain what he ex-
• pefts, but without reception, it feldom comes to'pafs with-
out' much difficulty and trouble.
When the lord of the 8ch (hall be in the firft or 2d, and
the lord of the 2d flrall receive him, it denotes it fuddenly
accompliffied.
If the lord of the 7th or 8th (ball be in the firft, and not
received of the lord of the afcendant, the moon or lord of
the fecond, it ihews the Querent ftiall be difappointed in
his expeftations, and comes off with lofs in demanding it.
If the fortunes be in good places, and be joined to the
lord of the afcendant or J) , the matter or bufinefs may be
accompliflred, though no reception happen.
;
Whether
( 77 )
'Vbether oneJball recover his Wages due to himfrom any Great
Perfon ?
The afcendant, lord of the afcendant and J are for the
';^erent, with the fecond Honfe and his lord.
The loth houfe with the lord thereof, iignifies the per-
ibn enquired after: the i ith and his lord for his fub»
dance.
If you find the lord of the afcendant or 5 ,
joined to the
lord of the nth, or to a fortunate planet in -the nth, free
-rotn affliaion, the querent Ihall obtain the wages of the
laid perfon.
And if it Ihall happen that the J ,
or lord of the afcend-
iant be joined to an infortune, and the infortunate planet
[receive them, the querent Iliall obtain his wages, although
with much' difficulty and delay.
But if no reception happen between the faid fignificators,
;ithe querent then hardly obtains his money enquired after.
QUESTIONS belonging to the THIRD HOUSE.
Of the Condition of an abfent Brother.
In this Queftion confider the Lord of the third, and the
Houfe, where he is pofited and accordingly judge of his
icondition, as if you find the lord of the third in cadent and
tobfcure houfe, and in d > , or g of the infortune, or in
-ibadafpeftof the lords of cadent houfes, the condition of
bthe brother is very forrowful ; but if in good afpeA of the
fortunes, and in good houfes, he is in a chearful and happy
(condition.
If the lord of the third be in the 4th; he gains by his in-
\ duftry in the place where he is, it being his houfe or fub-
* ftance*
If the lord of the third be in the 5th, not afflifted, thte
( brother is in health, and takes delight in the fociety of per-
s funs he lives among, but if afflicted, judge the contrary.
If
( 78 )
If the lord of the third be in the 6th, and afflifted by the
lord thereof, or by any of the infortunes, the brother is not
well, but in a weak condition ; if the lord of the lixth be in
the third, it ftiews the fame. • '
' Then mind whether the lord of the 3d be in ($ with
.the lord of the eighth, or applying to combuftion, for that
Ihews death, or at leaft great danger thereof ; but if you
find the lord of the 3d in the feventh, the abfent brother is
in the fame country he went into at firft, and thinks to con-
tinue there efpecially if in a fixed fign.
If the fignificator be in the 8th, is in danger either of
death or imprifonment, chiefly if the lords of the 8th and
1 2th afflift him there.
When the lord of the third fhall be in the 9th, it denotes
he is removed from the place he (atfirll) went into, and ac-
cording as his fignificator is well or ill afpedled, judge his
good or evil fuccefs.
And if in the loch, in or good afpeft of the fortunes,
it denotes he has got feme profitable office or employment

g of the infortunes, combuftion, or otherwife aflliifted, it is
to be feared the abfent brother is dead.
If his fignificator be in the nth, well afpefted of the
fortunes, it argues he is at the houfe of a friend, who en-
tertains him with great relpeft ; but if he fhall be afRidled
by the misfortunes, he is not well pleafed with his enter-,
tainment, but is troubled in his mind, and vexed, &c.
If the fignificator of the abfent party be found in the 12,
in d A or of the fortunes, and they no ways afflidted,
it fliews he trades in, and gains by great cattle, as horfes,
oxen, &c.
But if afflidled there, he is in fome trouble (perhaps im-
prifoned) for debt, efpecially if the lord of the feventh or
eighth, caft their ill afpefts thither.

with his condition, and the place where he lives.
If the lord, of the third be in the fecond, it being the

To refolve which, confider if there be a fortune in the

If ^ or I? be in the loth, or in the 3 d, or S and the

advice is not to be followed, nor is it fpoken with a good

if the fign afeending be moveable, and the lord of

QUESTIONS belonging to the FOURTH HOUSE.
Jf Treajure be hid in any place ?
In this queftion mind whether If., or ? or be in the
fourth in their dignities, and no ways afflifted, for then
it is more than probable there is treafure hid ; or if $ or
'lb be there in their houfes or exaltations without impedi-
ments, there may be treafure* (though not much) but if
they be there afflifted, it is in vain to dig for any treafure in
the place fuppofed.
The lord of the feventh difeovers the quantity of trea-
fure as well as quality, according as he is ftrong or weak.
Shall the ^erent find the hidden ‘Treafure P
If the lord of the fourth, or fignificator of treafure, apply
to a good afpeftol the lord of thealcendant, or fecondhoufe,
the former being in the fecond, the latter being in the af-
Cendant, it argues fpeeding, efpecially if -0 be in angle in
4:, or A to the firft or fecond, and well alpafled by If or
% . Or if a fortune be in the fourth, and behold the lord
of the afeendant, or fecond, wiUt a A*or ilc, or if ^ or ^
receive
{ «r )
>
receive the lord of the fifft, or D in the afcendant, be-^
holding the Lord of the jj.th with reception, argues the.
Querent may find the treafure. ;|
But if the faid fignificators be in or § , and no ftrongH
reception, there is no hopes of obtaining it. fl
If the fignificators be feparated from any fortune ini
angles that is ftrong, Ihews the treafure is already found, f
lb > d or in the afcendant, or in , or g to theU
lord thereof, it is loft labour to look after it. Good planetsS
in angles give hopes, bad planets the contrary. I
The fignificators oriental, it is but newly hid, if they be|
occidental, it has been hid a great while. ,
|
When you fearch or dig for treafure, let all or moft of I
the faid fignificators be ftrong and well afpeded, and the^.
lord of the hour be a fortur.e in his own dignities, in a goodj
place of the figure, and well afpeded.
t
Oy Buying or Hiring a Hotlfe, Lands, See, |
The afcendant with his lord and the D are for thej
Querent or buyer or taker of the houfe or land; the 4th
<
houfe fignifies the houfe &c. Enquired after.
The 7th houfe and its lord for the landlord or owner off
the faid houfe, the loth houfe with its lord and planets
f
there, fnews the price of the houfe or ground enquired af-‘
ter ; if the lord of the 7 th apply ta the lord of the afeen-i
dant the landlord will willingly agree with the Querent
^
about the bargain, and it will be foon done, if goods afpeds
’happen at the fame time angular and ftrong; or if the
lord of the afeendan^ or D apply to the lord of the 7th by 'j
a , A or , if the lord of the 7 th receive them, they
will agree, but he muft be fought after, if the 5 or any
planet transfer or colled the lights of the fignificator, it
fignify the fame.
Obferve the fame rules betweeri'the lord of the 4th and
afcendant. as you did. by lord of the 7th, or § may ef-
fed the bufinefs, provided it be with mutual reception, a
fortur.e in the icth or in or A to the lord of the ioth i
cr afcendant they will agree. 1
M But'
( 82 )
But if infortunes be there, or in or g , no bargain can
I
be efFefled, and they differ about time or repairs. See. if the
I
lord of the afeendant be ftrong in the afeendant, or in sfc or
A to the cufp thereof, or if "y. or ? be in the afeendant,
or if 0 be in the afeendant, and thefe not afflidled, thefe
'
are teftimonies he fhall take the houfe, &c-
'
Of the Seller.
'
If a fortune be lord of the 7th, and in the feventh, or if
he behold the feventh with a or A, the letter or feller of
the houfe, will prove pundlual to his word, but he will gain
thereby.
If lb or d' be in the feventh, and not lords thereof, you
mull aft warily in y6ur agreement, otherwife he will be
too hard for you.
If good planets be in fourth, they promife'a good con-
clufion of the bufinefs, if the lord of the fourth therein,
the fame.
If infortunes be in the fourth and afilifted, judge the con-
trary, is gj there, bad ; is S3 there, good.
Ifgood to remove, orftay vihere he is ?
If an infortune be in the afeendant reception or pere-
grine, or in the 4th or fecond in or § to their lords, it
is not good to ftay, or if the lord of^the 7 th be with a good
planet, and the lords of the afeendant or fourth with an evil
I
one, the fame.
Mr. Gadbury faith, If the lord of the afeendant or
j
fourth be in the 7th, and the lord of the afc'ndaiit and 7th,
I fortunate, fwift in motion, and ftrong, it' is belt for the
Querent to remain where he is.
If the lord of the 8th or 12th do afflift the lord of the
afeendant, he is privately fcandalized ; if the lord of the
6th be the afflifting planet, he has not his health where he
lives ; if by the lord of the loth, he has no trade, and de-
clines in his credit; if by the lord of the fetond or 0 af-
ftifted, he wants a ftock, and is in no thriving condition.

Of a thing hid, lof or mi

rr It be the (^erent’s own goods, judge thus, (viz.)
the lord ot the fccond be in an angle, the thing milling is
within the houfe of the Querent, chiefly if the difpofitor of
0 call his good afpeft to him there ; but if the fignificator
of goods be in the afcendant, or in the fign the lord of the
afcendant is in, or difpofed of by him, the thing milling is
in that part of the houfe the Querent moll frequents.
The lord of the fecond or }) in the loth, declares the
thing hid or millaid, to be in the hall or dining-room, pro-:
vided the Querent has the whole houfe in his pofl'effion
;
but if the Querent be a lodger, it is in that part of tha
houfe his landlord or landlady moll frequents ; but if 2
Tradefman afk tr.e Queftion, it is in his fhoo or countinn--
houfe.
Jf the faid lignificators be in the 7th, it is where his wife
or women-kind moll uieth ; if in the qth, where the father,
ancient man, or moft aged do lodge, or in fome old decay-
ed part of the houfe.
AW, If the lord of the fecond and 0 , with its difpofitor,
and fign of the fecond be in airy figns, or the ftrongell of'
tiiem, it is hid or millaid upon high Ihelves, eaves of'
houfes, or high from the ground.
Jf the figniticators be in watery llgns, it is in the but-
tery, dairy, walh-houfe, ne*r the cillcrn or fome moill
place.
If in fiery figns, near the chimney, or walls, or where
iron is laid.
Earthy figns, in the pavement under the earth, perhaps in
a cellar, if the lignificators be going out of one fign into
another, the thing :s fallen, betwixt two things, or near
the going out of the room, and is higher or lower, accord-

The afendant unfortunate, and the lord of the firft and

children, and if any, they are very fickly and fhort lived ; ji
T? or ^ may promife children, if they be ftrong, and in

they are weak.
Whether the ^erent be n.vith Child ?
If the lord of the afeendant 1) , or her difpofitor be in

Of the SIXTH HOUSE.
Whether the Servant or Lodger may be trujled ?
The lord of the afcendant and 1) are for the Querent, the
6th houfe his lord with the planets therein, are for the fer-

If either T;> or ^ or ^ be in the 6th, they are not faith-
ful, I? makes them dull, fluggifh and fullen ; $ makes
them ralh, and given to many unhappy asflion, as theft,
&c. y to cheeting and lying.
If the lord of the 6th be in or g to the lord of the
afcendant or 2d houfe, thefervant will be very unprofitable,
and prove (almoft) a continual crofs and vexation to the
(.iuerent, efpecially if no reception happen.
But if the lord of the 6th be in good afpeft to the lord of

DiJeaje long or jhert ?
The afcendant and his lord are fignificators of the lick

the loth houfe his medicines.

If the 7th houfe and his lord be afflidled, the phyfician
hardly cure.
The 10th houfe and his lord unfortunate, the phylick is
contrary and improper for the difeafe.
The 4.th houfe fliews the end thereof, whether long or
ihort, fix’d figns prolong it, common figns change it from
one dillemper to another, moveable figns ftiew a quick dif-
patch, either for life or death.
If the lord of the afcendant and 5 be combuft of the O »
denotes death ;
except !(. or J call their A or >fc afpedls
;o them, and well dignified ; Q and D afilidled under the
earth at the time of the queftion, denotes great danger.
If the O, S and lord of the afcendant and fixth be no
way afflifted the lick will certainly recover ; the lord of
the fixth, and afcendant, weak and afflifted by the lord
pf the 8th, and he an infortune, the fick hardly
efcapes.
The lord of the 8:h above the earth llrong, the lord of
the afcendant and 6th weak, and under the earth, there is
tittle hopes of recovery.
If the ]) be fwift in motion, and increafing in light, and
p-pply to the lord of the afcendant by 5<c or A, it per-
STorms the cure with fpeed ; efpecially if the lord of the a§-
pendant be not afflidled, and the fooner, if the lord of the
pfeendant be above the earth ; If and ? fti ong, and
jpr $ weak, hope well ; but if the inforcunes be llrong, and

Shall the fhierent Marry ?
Herein you are to confider the p^ficion of the lord of the
afeendant, the 5 and 5 , and their pofition, for they figni-
fy the party enquiring in this cafe.
If
( 105 )
If they or the major part of them, fliall be in fruitful figns,
it is a ftrong teftimony the party (fo enquiring) fliall marry.
Or when the faid fignincators lhall be in the yth houfe,
or in the dignities of the lord of the 7th, and the lord of
the yth in the afcendant, or in A or >f: to the figinificators,
the Querent will certainly marry.
But if none of thefe teltimonie? happen, and on the con-
trary, all the fignilicators of marriage in barren figns, and
in o or g to the feventh and its lord, you may tell the
party, he or Ihe, will not marry.
If Marry, hovj long will it befirf?
If you find the fignificators of marriage applying to each
other by a friendly afpedl in the oriental parts of heaven,
you may judge the Querent will marry fuddenly.
If in the occidental, feptentrional parts, the marriage
will be delayed and prolonged.
Hally faith, we ought to obferve the degrees of diflance,
either in body or afpedl, between the lord of the afcendant
and yth, the O or $ , and judge according to their pofition
in fixed, common or moveable figns as to the time of mar-
riage, efpecia’ly, if at that time there be a good tranfit to
bring it on. Moveable figns give weeks, common figns
give months or weeks ; fixed figns years or months. Thus
it the fignificators be flow in motion, and in fixed figns, their
degrees in diflance lhall be fo many years, if fwift fo many
months. EtJic de cateris.
Shall the ^tterent marry more than once ?
If moft of the fignincators be in double bodied figns, de-
clare the Querent to marry more than once; or the fignifi-
cators in good afpeft with many planets, denotes the fame
;
if from the yth an afcendant.
But if all or moft of the fignificators be in fixed figns,
and afpedl but one planet, it denotes marriage but once.
Id' hat manner of Perfon Jhall the Querent Marty P
Mind that planet the lord of the afcendant is neareft in
afped with, and obferve the fign he is in, and deferibe the
( )
perfon accordingly, for fuch an one the Querent will marry.
If the faid fignificators be in ^ or afpeft with ? , the
perfon is pleafant and merry; if with the ©, noble and of
great fpirit ; if with S , a raflt and angry perfon ;
if with
|
,
^ , the perfon is inclinable to melancholy, yet wife and
prudent ; if with If, honeft, juft and religious; if with ^ ,
fubtil and cunning, &c.
By obferving the dignities and debilities of the planets
aforefaid, the lhape, quality and conditions are known the
better.
Shall they agree after Marriage ?
If their feveral fignificators apply, or be in good afpeft
with one another, it fhews agreement and pleafure.
But'ifill afpefted, and by bad planets, judge the con-
trary ; and this the more certain, if there be no reception.
or d , or ?S iu the afcendant, fhews the quer.enc tp y
be the occafion of difference, by being obftinate and trou-
blefome, and always difcontented.
But if Ij , ^ , or be in the yth, fay the perfon whom
the querent fhall marry, will occafion the faid difcontent.
Shall the Marriage be effected net ?
If the lord of the afcendant or ]) be joined to the lord
©f the yth, or in or A to him, the marriage intended
will be brought to perfedlion, provided the afpeft be from
proper places of the figure.
But if a or § afpeft between their fignificators, and^
no manner of reception, you may conclude (and that truly)
he marr'age will be brpken off, then obferve what houfe
he obftruifting planet is lord of, and accordingly de-
ribe the perfon that fhall hinder it, as if of the loth a mo-
ther, 4th a father, 3d a brother or After, and fo of the reft,
judge in furthering the matter after the fame method, in ob-
ferving the good afpefts.

If good planets be in or A to the lords of the afcen-

dant and fecond houfe and difpoficor of 0 in the afcendanc'
or fecond houfe, it argues a recovery of the goods. '
hither If. or ? in the afcendant having dignities in the
2d houfe, or the D in the 7 th in or A to the lord oft
the afcendant, thefe are certain telHmonies of recovery of-
the things loft.

The D in the loth in good afpeft to a planet in fne fe-:.
cond, or in fecond in A to the lord thereof, or to the dif-
pofitor of 0 : the lord of the afcendant in the fecond, the
G and D in A to each other, or the lord of the fecond in
the eleventh or fourth houfes, all thefe are great figns of re-j
covery; the lord of the 8th in the afcendant, or with iu
lord, denotes recovery.
'll, ? or a in the eleventh, gives great hopes.
The D , 0 his difpofitor, or lord of the fecond in the
the 8th, is an argument of non-recovery; if both the lumi-1
naries be under the earth, it is hard to be recovered, and if
at the fame time the lord of the fecond be combuft, ’tis m
vain to feelc after it.
T? , d or S in the fecond houfe, and out of their efi'en-
tial dignities, or the lord of the fecond in the eighth, or m
combuftion, or the fecond houfe afflifted by the lord of the
eighth, thefe are ftrong teftimonies of no recovery. !
When the lord of the feventh fhall be joihed to the lora
of the eighth, and the lord of the fecond behold not the
firft houfe nor its lord, and at the fame time the Q and W
under the earth, not afpefting each other, or 0, ’tis almofl
impoflible to recover the goods. 1

A planet afftifting the fecond houfe, his lord or 0, whe-
ther he be peregrine, or eflentially dignified, fliall figni^
the thief, and the more certain, if at the fame time the af-
fliaing planet hath dignities in the feventh houfe ; if nc
planet afflid the fecond, his lord or 0, fee if there be t

Whether a long Journey or Vyage ’will be profperous or not ?
Jupiter or ? in the ninth houfe, or In good afpeft to the

If the lord or the 9th or afcendant be In or § to the
lord of the twelfth or fixtb, he will be in danger of iiripri-
fonment before he can return, chiefly if the lord of the i
fourth be afflifted.
But it it be a voyage to fea, obfcrve the afcendant, for
though the ninth and tenth houfe be ever fo well beheld,
yet it the lord of the afcendant be atflifted by the lord of
the eighth he may die notwithftanding, or if the lord of the
fixth be atflifted, he may be flain or wounded ; lord of the
twelfth, imprifonmcnt ; the lord of the fourth in a watery
lign, drowning.
Significators in moveable figns, his return will be quick
;
in common ligns, not fo foon ; fixed figns, longed of all.
If the fignificators be oiiental, a Ihort voyage or journey ; r,-
occidental, a long one.
But you mull have regard to the poflibility of the voyage
or journey, for it all the fignificators be in moveable figns
we cannot judge a journey or voyage to be performed to
Edinburgh in Scotland fo foon as to the city of York in Eng-
land, though the fignificators of journey to York be in fix-
ed figns (fignifying the flay long) and thofe for Edinburgh
be in moveable figns (fignifying quicknefs) therefore ob-
ferve what has been faid, and accordingly mix reafon with

If a Perfon hatn a defire to know whether he fhall ob-

yet it is polfible to refolve the doubt thus, give the afcrn-
dant his lord and 5 to fignify the querent, the elevcntl
houfe and his lord for the quefitcd, and judge by the fol-
lowing rules.
If you find the fignificators in good afpeft and in recep
tion (as in the former Qaeftion) you may conclude the mat-
ter or thing hoped for is attainable, either the lord of thi
afcer.dant or 1) received in fix-ed figns, do (hew the querent
that he fhall obtain the bu.finefs he hopeth for ; if in moveabl
figns, he (hall obtain but little, if any ;
ifin bi-corporal figus
he fhall then have part of what he defires.
If on the contrary, you find the fignificators in ol 5
void of reception, having no tranflation of light, combufl
cadent or retrograde, or with fixed liars of an evil infiuencei
you may then judge the matter hoped for will hardly b(
brought to perfeftion.

fonof the fewnefs of vapors and fumofities ingendered ; or
elfe, becaufc that the radical moiflure whereby the virtue
nutritive and vegetable is fuftained, is by the operation of
ftrong heat and drynefs drawn to the centrq, and there part-
ly confumed; as fire (of whofe nature is choler) attradeth
moifture to itfelf, and drieth it up, fo that the fuperfices and

becaufe of defediion of natural moifture (as in aged perlons
in whom radical moifture is decayed) groweth- no more:
and his fkin is rough and hot in touching, and his body very
hairy } tljcir colour is betwixt yellow and red, with a cer-

their conditions, they are naturally quick-witted, boldt

lent, flout, arrogant, couragious, gracelefs, cruel, crafty,
and unconftaijt ; light in moving, jefters, mockers, watch-
ful, and flatteiers, &c. their eyes little and hollow. Alfo
the virtue of concodlion jn them is very ftrong, infomuch
that he may digeft more then he hath appetite for; his
pulfe is fwlft and ftrong, his urine yellow, and thiii in Tub-
itance : as touching their oigeftion, they are often coflive,
they dream of fire, fighting, and anger, of lightning, ani
dreadful apparitions in the air, by the means of hot and dry
fumofities and vapors afcen'ding from the fiomach into the
head, which trouble the brain and virtue imaginative.
Signs of a Cholerick Melandocly Man.
Cholerick mclanchcly men, are higher of ftature than
cholerick, becaule violent heat-in them is more remifs and

Tieanlv hairy, and temperate in feeling; their colour is pa-

. little fhew of yellowilhnefs ; they have not beards fo

rracelefs, unconftant, flattering, fwift, and fcornful as they :
set they are fufpicious, fretful, nigardly, and more folita'
ly, ftudious, and curious then cholerick, and retain their
mger longer. The virtue of digeftion in fuch perfons is
needy llrong, and their pulfe lelfer and flower than in cho*
jerick perfons; their urine is yellow and thin, and they
dream of falling from high places, of robberies, murders,
aarms proceeding from fire, fighting, anger, and fuch like.
Signs cf a Mela7tcholy Cholerick mail.
iilelancholy cholerick men are tall of flature, by reafon
that natural heat is feeble, and thereby many fumofities
are ingendered; but they are little and flender of body, be-
caufe of drynefs, therefore their Ikin is rough and hard,
and cold in touching: they have but very little hair oh
iheir bodies, and are long without beards, by means of
cold which ftoppeth the pores, and fuffereth not the raat-
whereof hair is ingendered to come forth. Alfo they
nave much fuperfluity in the nofe; their colour is pale,
faadowed with a little nigritude, or darknefs. Ard
Iconcerning their conditions, they are gentle, given to
dobriety, folitary, ftudious, doubtful, avaricious, fhamefaced,
limorous, ftubborn, fretful, penfive, conftant, and true in

Signs of a Melancholy Man.
Melancholy men are mean of ftature, and feldom very
tall;
tall ; for excefiive cold doth bind the fubftance, and fufFer-
eth it not to llretch in length ;
and although melancholy !
men be dry in temperature, yet they are little, and {lender i
of body, the occafion is (as I imagine) of excellive colcjl, i
by means whereof much fuperiluity is ingendered, which !
fomewhat alaycth the drynefs ; for melancholy men are full l
of flegm, and rhumatic matter. Their colour is duflciih,
'
and fwartilh pale; their fkin is rough, and cold in feeling;
they have very little or no hair on their bodies, and are
long without beards, yea, fometimes beardlcfs; the colouf •
of their hair is dufkifh: As touching their conditions, they
are naturally covetous, felf-lovers, fearful without caufe
;
pulillanimous, folitary, careful, lumpifh, feldom merry or
laughing, ftout, ftubborn, ambitious, envious, fretful, oblli-
nate in opinions, of a deep cogitation, niiftruflful, fufpi-
cious, vexed with dolours of the mind, and dreadful imagi-
naticms, (as though they were infefted with evil fpirits) anf
are very Ipileful, curious, fqueamifli, and yet Hovens;
high-minded, and very majeftica! in behaviour, and retain
their anger long ; The virtue of concoftion in them is very
feeble ;
yet they have very good appetite to their meat.
Their u ine is palifh and mean in fubftance, and they dream
of fearful things, terrible vifions, and darkncfs.
Sigfts of a Mclancholkk Sanguine Man,
Melancbolick fanguinc'men are higher of fiature then'me-

their colour is after a darkilh red, their (kin neither hard

patient, trufty, merciful, ard affable ;
and to conclude, for
as much as this cCmplexicn is cemprr.ite in qualiiy, fo like-
v\'iie it is boon in conditions ; for virtue is a m; an between
( *29 )
wo extremes. Their urine is of a light faffronifli colour^

melancholy perfons. Their pulfes are great and full, urine
rellow and mean in fubftance, with dreaming of deep pits,
wellsj and fuch like ; their digeftion is indifferent.
Signs of a Sanguine Man.
Sanguine men are of a mean form, their bodies well

s white, intermixed with rednefs in the cheeks; their hair
ur the moft part is bro'.vn. And touching their conditions,
ihey are merry, liberal, bountiful, merciful, courteous, bold
rnough, trufly, faithful, and of good behaviour: a little
hing will caufe them to weep, and when that is done, no
urther grief ftriketh to their hearts ; which is contrary to
nelancholy men, for they cannot weep, although it be in a
natcer that concerns them near, but ye: their cogitation
'iiereof is imprinted in their hearts. The fanguine man

Choleric phlegmatic men are mean of ftature, firm, and .
(ftrong of body, and neither fat nor lean ; with great legs,
land their Ikin hairy, and moderate in feeling; their hair is
lyellowilh, and their colour the fame ; their conditions are
mot much different from choleric men, but they are not al-
itogether fo furious anJ bold as they, neither fo prodigal ;
land guileful ;
for flegm doth fomewhat allay the heat of '
icholer ; their digeftion is perfccd, their pulfe fwi,^, and ;
: their urine like fafiron, and thin, with dreaming of battles, \

! fcr chufivg of times proper and convenientfor the Undertaking
and Performance of any Bufnejs or matter whatfoever accord-
j
ing to BLAGRAVE's many Tears PraRice and Experience.
NNOTWITHSTANDING there is a way already fet
forth how to give Judgment upon any matter,- or
tliirig material which belongeth unto every Houle, yet it
. will be of great concernment to deft and chufe times con-
, venjent whereby each bufinefs, intent or purpofe may be
I
perfefted and brought unto a timely end according unta
1 the querents defire. But before we can proceed herein, I
;
muft give feme inftrudlions concerning the firll Houfe, as
j
followcth.
! Advertifmetits concerning the Firf Houfe.
That which is chiefly to be confldered herein, is to take
notice under w^at planets both the querent and quefited are
I
governed: in all queftions and demands whatfoever, the
I
degrees afeending on the cufp of the firfl: Houfe, doth ufu-
:
ally perfonate the native or queient, and doth properly
con-
( *33 )
iiconcern the cafualties belonging unto their body; but the
ilord thereofv efpecially if in his own terms, lhall concern
ihis aftiqns, as having to do with others, except fometimes
:by accident a planet happens to be ftrong in the afcendant
AM the birth, or be almuten of the figure, and then the native
;or querent will participate of the nature of that planet,
which unto people of years may be known by their qua-
.lities, trades, or profefiions, (they continuing therein)
^without having their nativities, but a child or youth can-
unot well be capable of Eiedlions, except his nativity may
ibe had, and fo by the rules beforegoing find under what
jplanet he is governed ; for a Mars-youth, or a Mars-man
rdoth not always bear a Mars-fhape ;
nor yet a Venus-man a
' Venus-lhape ; for the figns whereof they are lords doth ufu-
iaily dtferibe their perfons (except fometimes by accident as
;afcrera;d, neither can the Ibape of any man or woman dif-
I cover under what planet they are governed ; for we know
1 there is a great difference in (hapea between the figns and
itheir lords deferibed. And oft-times neither the fign af-
)ce,nding, nor lord thereof perfonate or deferibe what qual-
iicies are predominant in the native ;
for that planet which
I is almuten of the figure many times doth do it. As in-
: fiance, in the geniture of Henry the Eighth, King of Eng-
. land, fet forth by the learned Cardan, in which nativity we
find the fign JiJi to afeend, whereof $ is lord, yet neither
'
the fign afeending, of its lord doth perlonate, or deferibe his
fitape, qualities or natural inclinations ;
for he was clearly
under d , and martially inclined, the reafon thereof is be-
caufe d is almuten of his figure, as having moll effential
‘
dignities in the afcendant, rhid heaven and place of the lu-
minaries, yet nothwithftanding he might, and did fome
what participate of the nature of O, 5 and ? ; for § is
i in the Houfc of ©, and the O in his terms, § is all'o in
^ to $ , and Ihe in platick A to the afcendant, and the
luminaries in angles, all which might well fignify the lofti-
nefs of his fancy and Ipirit ; but in cafe of Eieflion we can
• allot but or e planet to the querent, and one to the quefited,
which mull be thofe that have the greatcll predominacy
' over them, according to their lliape qualities or profeliions.
Generally
( ^34 )
Generally I have obferved that in what planets terms the
degrees afcending are in, or the lord thereof, efpecially if
ii almuten of the figure, fuch will be the natives or 'querents
1
qualities, or natural inclinations, and he lhall naturally ei-
ther by trade, office or profeflion, defire to follow, or em- ,
ploy himfelf, in fuch a way which is fuitable to luch a'
planet, wherefore in this way of Elcftions I rather adhere
unto the qualities, trade, office cr employment of the que-
.rent, and efpecially of the quefited if of age (than unto
’
their bodily fhape) for oft-times when either nx or T af-
cends at the time of birth or queftion, the native or que-
!'
rent fhall not refemble the fhape of a Mars-man or woman,
but rather correfpond with the afcendant or planet ftrong
in the afcendant, or almuten of the figure ;
for although
; the native or 'querents perfon may be folar or faturnine,
||
yet by the rules beforegoing he may be martially inclined,
I' and under $ , or according unto the nature of any other
!' planet under which he is governed; were It not fo, each
trade or profeffion would have m^enbut of one fhape, and fo
all men governed under any planet the like ;
but we fee dai-
ly to the contrary; for there are of all fhapes under any
'
planet governed, and likewile in every trade or profeffion
whatfoever ;
wherefore except the native or querents per-
fon reprefenting any planet doth correfpond in qualities,
;
trade and profeffion, it will not ferve in cafe of eleftions.
I have found by experience, that young men being put
'
unto fuch trades or profeflions which they were not natural-
!! ly add:£led unto, or did delight in, they feldom or ne-
|j
ver do ferve cut their times; and if they do endure their,
!'
bondage, and fet up their trade, is ten to one if they thrive,
I. or long continue therein ; for they will be apt to alter thei
calling according unto the nature of that planet which mofl
predominacy over them generally, in rcfolving any quef-
I
tions efpecially in cledlicns, the afcendant muft be obtained
'
either from the nativity, or frem feme accident of body, or
, from the tim.e when the queient doth propound the quef-
! tion : and then if the figure beiadical, we need not trouble
f
ourfclves any further, but only by the rules beforegoing to
j
find under what phar.et the querent is governed, v/h’ch rrutl
( 135 ) !
ube either the lord of the afcendant, or planet ftrong in the
^
nafcendant, or almucen of the figure, which by obferving the
'
i; querents fhapc, temper and profeflion may eafily be difco- ^
livered. But as to the quefitei there is no other way (except
j their nativity might be had) but only by their fex, fliape,
1 temper, employment, trade, or profeffion, to find what
^planet is agreeable thereunto ; and if their bodily (hape and
profeflion doth accord it is the better ; it matters not of
nvhat relation they are to the querent, for kindred, brothers,
ineio-hbours, &c. may be under feveral planets governed, fo
. that to take the lord of the third in cafe of dealing with a
‘ kinfman, neighbour, or brother will not ferve, except the
t lord thereof doth accord in bodily ihape and qualities, and
fo of the reft. As the firfl: houfe is for the the querent, fo
r the other eleven houfes (hall be concerned in chufing a fit
r time for the undertaking of any bufinefs whatfoever, yet fo
. the querent may obtain his defire, thefe things being pre-
1 mifed, I (hall proceed.
f ELECTIONS appertaining unto the SECOND HOUSE; j
to chufe a fit time either by Mejfengers, or in ferfon to ob-
'
tain Money, or nxihat elfe is duefrom the debtor.
Although I have already upon thofe judgments on the
i twelve houfes fet forth how the meflenger would or (hould
lltfpeed in cafe of fending for money or any thing owing
I without any eledled time; yet if the native or querent doth
defire to chufe fuch a time that he may fpeed, then he mult
do as follows; Firfl, having by the rules before-going found
under what planets both the querent, and quefited are
governed. As having molt predominancy over their bodily
lhapes, trades, offices or employments, which they willing-
ly follosv; then if their be a d , A. or :(< afpefl, cfpecially
applying thereunto between their fignificators, or if there
be any itrong reception between them ; or if the D , or any
inferior planet doth tranflate the influence of the planet
i which
( 13^ )
which concerns the quefited unto the querent, it argueth
fpeeding.
If the lord of the quefited be in the houfe of the querent,
and well afpeSed of the fortunes, and sot e/illy afpefted of J
the infortunes, it denotes fuccefs. m
Lallly, if the planet belonging to the debtor, or his 0, J
or his lord of 0 be in the querent’s afcendant, or fecond
"
houfe, one of the former teftimonies concurring, it gives an
aflurance of fpeeding, provided that the debtors planet and
0 be ftrong in eflential dignities, for if they be weak, it
Ihews willingnefs without ability to perform. In fuch cafes
the creditor muft chufe fuch. times, by the rules foregoing,
'
when the debtor’s planet and 0 be well dignified. Some-
times colledlion may do it by a third party, whofe planet
is in trine or fextile to both hgnificators ;
and likewife may '
hinder it, as being in quartile or oppofition to them. ;
Of horronuing Money.
If the querent delires to borrow money of any body ; it
is no matter of what relation, by the foregoing rules, hav-
ing found what planets are for the querent and quefited ;
then if their fignificators be applying to each other, the
better, if the fignilicator of the quefited to the querent by
(5 , A, or :1c afpedl ;
or if 5 or any inferior planet tranl-
lates the influence of the one to the other, or if there be
llrong reception between them, it argues fuccefs. And if
the lord of the quefited be in the querent’s houfe, and fo
difpofed by him ; or if the lord of the quefited bo in the
querent’s fecond, or in <5, A, or afpeft with the lord
of the fecond, or with 0, or its lord, and one or more of
the former teftimonies concurring, it gives affurance of
fucceeding ; but if the lord of the quefited, or his 0 be
weak and evilly ai'pefted by the infortunes or lortunes, or
is difpofed by them, it Ibeweth willingnefs without ability
to perform : perhaps his money is out of his hands, or the
thing defired is in th,c cuitody of otke.'S ; in fuch a cafe the
queient mult chufe fuch times as the planets are fuitable,
and the lord of the quefited and his 0 arc ftrong, and not
evilly afpedlcd or dilpcled by others ; and then the querent
may

or if there be. rtrong* reception or tranflation ; or if the lord

and if the lord of the quefited be in 4 » A or afpeft

if the lord of the fourth be llrong in the afcendant, or if
the D or any i iferior planet doth feparate from the one,
ard apply to the other by any friendly afpedls, it ar-
gueth a.good p oceeding the.'-ein, and that the building will

Generally, if there be a fortune in the fourth, or if the

^
Note, if the lord of the afcendant and fourth be well
i dignified, afpefting or receiving each ocher: or if the ])

If the native or querent fha’l defire to elefl: a fit time to
^vifit anv maid or woman body, that fo he may obtain her love,
then having by fliape, trade, or profeflion difcovered und^r
what planet file is governed ; If there be a (5 , A,cr;fC atpeft
betwixt their fignificators, e'pcxially applying thereunto, or
if there be reception, or if the 5 , or any inferior or retro-
grade planet doth tranflate the influence of the one to the
other, it argueth fpecding; if her lignificatcr b' in the af-
cendant, fortunate, flie ftial! be much ruled by him ;
alfo if
the lord of the feventh, the J confignificator of the fe-
venth or $ the ufual fignificator of women, be in friend-

ly afpeft unto the lord of the afcendant, and doth difpjfd

fpeeding ; or if there be reception or tranflat'on betwixt
them, it Iheweth fpeeding; the cpierent mull chufe fuch
time when moll of thole before-mentioned teflimonies are
in force, which time and opportunity will hold during their

Generally, if there be application, by <5 , A , or if; af-

or if the lord of the afcendant doth difpofe of her planet, as

the J , and ? concurring, it giveth allurance of good

without reception, and evilly afpeded of the infortunes,
and in bad houfes, judge the contrary.
I lhall relate a paflage which happened between a o-en-
tleman and lady in point of wooing.
*
This gentleman having formerly made many addrefles,
and with good fuccefs, taking times fuitable, inibmuch that
he thought it impoflible to fail ; whereupon at a time by
himfelf prefixed, he was refolved to go and finilh, what he
had before in a great meafure perfefted, (the truth is, I al-
vyays told him he would fpeed, provided that he took fuch
times as I advifed him) I told him that if he went at that
t^ime, he might unhappily fpoil all that he had done, for
both her and her friends would be very crofs and averfe
;
for at that time by him intended, the principal fignificators
>here in and g , and the ]) did alfo l.'parate and apply
by a and § accordingly. But this geniieman faid'he
iould not believe that there could be any fuch force in the
liars and planets, whereby to alter her' afleilion being fo
firmly (as he thought) fettled, I defired him to call at my
boufe when he returned, and to let me know how he
fped ; and at his return he told me that he found my
words very true, for (he was fo much altered both in !:ir,d-
nefs and aflcftion that he verily believed that fomebndy
had done fo.mc ill office betwixt the.m, and was mincivd.

have left her to her own will. But I cheated him up, and
iitold him that if he went at fuch a time, as I would diredf,
he would fpeed ; and then I advifed him to finilh up the
match, which he did and they were married accordingly.

Of Duels, and Lanv-Suits.
If the querent be necellitated to fight a duel, or to begin
a law-fuit, then let the lord of the afeendant be ftrong, and
j
well dignified, and well afpedted of the fortunes, let the
llord of the feventh be v. eak and debilitated. But efpecial-
I ]y let that planet be weak and unfortunate wMch reprefents
j
the enemy ;
and let the lord of the afeendant be his difpo-
1 fitor, and let there be a fortune in the afeendant, or calling
I
feme friendly afpeft to the afeendant : and let there be an
I
.infortune in'the feventh, or calling his evil afpedl thereun-
to ;
all which are arguments that the querent (hall prevail,
either in the law-fuit, or duel. If there be a fortune in the
querents fourth, or if the lord of the fourth be ftrong in.
the afeendant, or in A or to the afeendant or to the
'lord of the afeendant, it argueth a good end ; and if there
1 be a A or ife afpeft, between the lord of the fourth, and
:
' lord of the fecond, or to © or his lord, it flreweth gain by
I
the fuit or duel ; and if the lord of the tenth and fourth call
i
their friendly afpeft unto the afeendant or his lord, then
|, the querent lhall gain honour by his law fuit or duel.
_
Generally, if the lord of the afeendant be ftrong in ef-
fential and accidental dignities, and well afpedled of the for-
tunes, and is more ftrong than the lord of the feventh, or
the 5, confignificator of the feventh, but chiefly morcj

but in genitures they are determined to fotne particular

life or deftroy ; but if determined in the radix to neither of
thefe, then it neither helps nor hinders, and operates no-
i
thing at all (at leaft that is notable) concerning life. In
,
like manner, a planet adapted for honour, by its nature and
'
radical determinations, tranfiting the M. C. or angle of ho-
!
nour, confers honour ; but determined to the contrary, as
imprifonment, banifhment, death, &c. efpecially if it be of a

,.:or 5 too, then their fig ification and virtue, as to efFcdl, will
i.oe doubled; but the (5 of a planet tranfiting in fuch a
' place, is more powerful than their afpefls ; el'pecially if it
!
be a (5 of the luminaries, or either of them with any other

planet ; and therefore mark diligently the 4 of the O and
S in the degrees of the malefic planets of the radical fi-
[.gure, or in thofe degrees oppofite ; efpecially when both or
I
either of the luminaries rule the horofeope, for the malevo-
1 lent planet, in whofe degrees fuch a conjunflion happens,
may be accounted a fignificator of death or difeafe, and ini-
; mic-1 to the horofeope, and rarely does fuch a conjundlion
1 happen upon a congruous direftion, unattended with death
I or difeafe, as has often been experienced,
to. The tranfits of two planets of the like fignification
laforeiaid, at the fame time by divers places of alfinity be-
I tween themfelves, by nature or radical determination ; as
! the place of the lord of the M. C. and fecond houfe, or of

logical or radical fignification of the tranfit, do yet augment
its virtue much more than when they are related in fignifi-
cation.
I 3. Of thofe placer, by which tranfits hapoen, we fhould
note the fiate and condition, for if Tj be in the eighth houft
of the radix and the twelfth of the revolution, and weaker
in bad configuration with his radical place, then the fame
day, when the lord of the horofeope (hall tranfit or pafs by
fuch a radical place, there will happen fome difeafe or dan-
ger of life : cfpecially if or either of the luminaries,
(hall then alfo caft an ill afpedl to fuch a place, nor ought
we to mind the place, only palfed by, but likewife of the
planet tranfiting ; for if S , tranfiting the horofeope,
fltall have been in the eighth or twelfth houfe of the re-
volution, and ill affedled, it renders the tranfit fo much
the worfe.
14. The tranfits of planets in <5 , over the degree of fome
diredlion in the radix, though that p! ape be em»ty; that
is, be not the radical place of any planet or cufp of a
houfe, wanteth not its effedls, if it be a tranfit of the lumi-
naries, conjoined efpecially with an eclipfe too.
15. The aiflual virtue of the moon’s tranfits continues
but 6 hours before and after the partile tranfit, and In other
planets for a whole day before and after, by the common
confent of mod aftrologers; yet as long as a planet covers,
by his orb of virtue, the place by which the tranfit is faid
to be made, it hath an efficacy to produce the tranlit’s cf-
fefts, w'hich fometimes happen fwiftcr or flower than the
aforefaid limits ;
becaufe it requires a necellary concourli\
of other caufes to its produdlion, and here note, that tife?
future efi'edls depend on the tranfit, not only as to actual
time, but alfo as to its nature, manner, and circumiiance,
which are all aftuated thereby, and confcquently may
t '.ence be forefeen. Note alfo, when one bad tranfit in a
fmall time fucceeds another by the fame place, during an
agreeble direction and revolution ; as if the tranfit of Tp ,
lord cf the twelfth houfe over the horofeope, be followed
by that of S' lord of the eighth houfe, and thefe traniit-s
he
( 159 )
! be bv body, fquare, or oppofition, the fame will prove mor-
tal to the native, or of very dangerous confequence. Lart-
ly, if a planet, who is benevolent, be in the radical M. C.
1 er be lord thereof, and daring a congruous direflion or re-
I
volution, fhall tranfit the horofc.jpe of the radix, or the

place of its lord, efnecially when lirong and in good confi-
I
guration with the lord of the afcendant, the fame fl;all pro-
: duce great fuccefs to the native in his dignities and under-
; takings.
According to thefe aphorifms, if the ftudent be but fo i
ingenious as to know by a halfpenny how a fliillin^ is coin- ,
ed, he mav, by the fame parity of reafon, rationally judge ;
of the effecls of all tranfits whatfoever. Coley.
OF THE WEATHER.
AN APERTIO PORTARUM,
FOR THE WHOLE YEAR.
That which the feriptures call an opening of the win-
dows of heaven is here termed by allronomers, aper-
tio portarum, which happens upon three principal meetings
of the planets, not unaccompanied without an evident and
ipanifelt alteration in the air. The firlt aperiio portarum, is
^6f O, b > ttud ]) , whofe effefts are mar.ifetted in a turbulent,
cold and cloudy air efpecially in the earthy and airy figns ;
but in moill figns it caufes (bowers and in winter fnow,
efpecialiy when b ftationary, retrograde and lord of a
lunation. The lecond is of If. and ^ , which draws itfelf
in turbulent winds; efpecially in fiery figns: the winds
blow hard with little or no rain. The third is of $ and ? ,
which demon.'lratcs its e(fed.i in thunder, lightning, and

Jf thofe pLinets, which rule the principal places in a ce-
leftlal figure, at the funs entrance into the vernal equinox,
be combuft, they portend a dark and cloudy air, in fum-
mer, heat, and thunder; in autumn, cr.ld and moillure ; in
winter, cloudy with fome fouthern winds.
Moift figns are 25, jf . >€> the parts of the
figns which are moift are the latter end of , the begin-
ning of y , 25, the end of Vf and beginning of XC7 and SI V
$ , ^ , and D are rainy planets. In a revolution of the
year, S m his proper fign, which is r(i, fignifies much
rain ;
in the houl’e of Ij , little or none at all ; in other, a
mediocrity.
In the revolution of a year, 5 , ^ , and D in moift-
places, import abundance of rain.
Jf in autumn you find many retrograde planets with ©,
and that in winter they be diredf, expedl a great drought.
If in fummer the planets be direfl, the heat will be moderate:'
if retrograde, it will be more extreme ; $ and § combuft
at autumn produce cold'and moifturc ; in winter cloud, and
fouthern wind ; in fummer, heat and thunder. The fame
holds true of T? , If and $ if in the fame condition.
When the © (hall be in eighteen deg. of if J be
their joined in a moift place, we may then expedl fo much,
rain as will overflow the low ground.
The D in g to any planet in Tr]., or one planet in §
to another in rr[, generally brings rain, $ retrograde and
oriental, 0 being in Vf, .CdT, K, in fummer Imports fome

The 5 in g of 0, or with ? in v, or K»:

Finally, there are fix things to be confidered concerning ;
the mutation or change of the air ; FirJ}, at c5 . j or g
of the luminaries, you mud find out the lord of the -afcen-
dant, his nature, and qualities, for the feafon will incline
to his condition. Secondly, the fign wherein the lord is, and
its quality : ’Thirdly, confider the fign afcending its na-

fider to what planet or fixed liar the lord of the figure is
joined, or by whom he is irradiated ; from thofe things
dueiy confidered, there refulteth this corallary.
If the lord of the 6 , D , or g be moift, the aforefaid

the faid lord joined to moift planets or liars, and the
F , after feparation, be in (5 or afpeCl widi a moift pla-

incline to drynefs, it will be dry, &c. Then will the alter-
ation of the air be moft apparent when F , after 6 /D or g be

Upon the application to know the event of the faid tic-

For the Scheme of this ^ujlion, See the Plate.
We allow the moon 6 hours motion : Ihe m.oves one de-

gree in two hours. This queRion conce-ms the 2d houfe,
thr.: being the houfe of fubftance, the moon muft be con-
fulted with the fign of the zd and loth. £5 the fign af-
cending, exaftly defcribcd the gentlem.an enquiring, he be-
ing a large mafculine perfon, of an intrepid countenance,
free and generous. In this figure we find no planet angu-
lar but ^ , and he has little to do in this pueRion. 'I'he
lords cf the zd and 6ih are both fuccedent, and both the
luminaries cadent, in the 6th aid in conjunftion with that
mcff evil planet “b - who is in his own houfe and fign; he
is hurtful here ; neither does the fcxtile of 'll yield much
benefit to the querent. The fum, his fignificator, is not
fortunate, but cadent, and in detriment, not having got up
to the fign of the 7th :
$ in y is afflifled by T? , and then
Ihe receives her firft o in her natural and local courfeV
Tiie queiHcn being by night, the mocn muR be faid to have
more dominion' than the I'un. 11 rules by day, and ^ by
night, in his own triplicitv ; ^ lord of tiie houfe of WL-alth,
applies by body and afpcct, to evil plinets : the fun, lord
of 0, is much afflidlcd, argues loE ; fur the above reafons
we
( *68 )
we may reafonably affirm the ticket will be a blank, in 2
few days ;
which accordingly happened on the loth of Fe-
bruary, 1786 following, when the 3),was in oppofition, 5
lord of the querent’s zd. We would advife the young art-
ift to take down the time of day or night when he infures or
buys a ticket, and ereft the figure from the exadt minute,>;
as near as he can.
Had there be a fortune in the zd or loth houfe, or many
planets in angles^, or D , ? , or g , fortunate, we muft have
readily concluded the pctfon would have had a prize of
great value; but the reverfe is too plainly feen in this ex-
ample.

Ofthe ButCs Declination in Degrees and Minutes.
Which is a certain diftance in degrees and minutes that
the fun declines, either north or fouth from the equinoftial,
paffing through the 1 2 figns of the zodiac ; for when he
paffeth through <Y', n, and toucheth 25 , his north de-
clination is greateft, which is 23 degrees 31 minutes, &c.-
and then he returns again through S5 , Sly and touch-
eth where he hath no declination, but paffing through
^y lU* •?> touching l/f, where his greateft fouth de-
clination is, being alfo 23 degrees 31 minutes, and then he
returns back from thence alfo through Vf, K, and
touching v again, where he hath likewife no declination,
but is upon the equinoftial ; and for to find out his decli-
nation for any degree of the ecliptick, this table is here
inferted, whole ufe is thus, take notice of the fign and de-
gree O is in, and if the fign be at the top, count the de-
grees downwards in the firft column, but if the fign be at
the bottom, then count the degrees upwards in the laft co-
lumn, and in the common angle where the fign and degrees^'
meet, is the fun’s declination in degrees and minute's.
Example.
O being in 18 degrees of a , find 18 in the firft column,
and againft it, under y is 17 degrees 15 minutes, G’s
declination.
Ofthe Suit's Amplitude.
The amplitude or the fun, moon, or any ftar, is the dif-
tance in degrees and minutes of their rifing and fetting from
the true eaft or weft points of the ccinpafs upon the horizon,
afid the fun’s greateit amplitude is about 40 degrees on ei-
ther fide of thofe points, both in his rifing and fetting
(viz.) his rifing is from within 5 degrees of the fouth-eaft
point to 5 degrees of the north eaft point, and his fettipgis
from 5
degrees of the fouth-weft point to 5
degrees of the
north-well point ; and I have here fixed a final! table that
may ferve to find it out for every two degrees of the eclip-
tic, and is to be underftood after the fame manner, as the
table of the fun’s declination,

Exafftple.
The fun being In 12 deg. of it, his amplitude is require-
ed ; find 12 in the firll column, and in the fecond column
againft it under di is 7 degrees 30 minutes for his fouth I
amplitude, O being alfoin 16 degrees of what is his||
amplitude? Now SI is at the bottom of the table, therefore!
count the degrees upwards in the lad column until 16 isl
found, then againll it, over SI, is 26 degrees 55 minutes,
which is O’s north amplitude. Note, if he is in northern I
figns, his declination or amplitude is north ; but if he is in
fouthern figns, then it is fouth. So this table may fervej
for common ufe, although in fome odd minutes it is not!

Of the Sun's Merislian Altitude.
The fun’s meridian altitude, is his diftance from the ho-
rizon in degrees and minutes, when at any time he is on
the meridian, whofe greateft altitude is about 62 degrees,
which is 28 degrees from the zenith, and his lealt altitude
is not full 15 degrees, being near 75 degrees diftance from
the zenith ; fo that there are 47 degrees between his higheft
and loweft place on the meridian, which may eafiiy be
known by a quadrant ; but for lack of which, I have here
alfo placed a table, fliewing the fun’s meridian altitude for
every fecond degree in each lign.

' The ufe of this table is after the fame manner as the for-

Example.

Exatnple.
The fun being in 6 degrees of n, (which is upon the
ii6:h day of May) I defire to know his altitude when he is
upon the meridian, viz. jail at noon; I find 6 in the firft
column of degrees, and againft it under n is
59 degrees
[51 minutes, the fun’s altitude, and he being in 24 degrees
lof 25, hath again the fame, as appears by 25 being at bot-
Itom, and finding 24 in the lall column of degrees ; and at
;any time to know his dillance from the zenith, do but fub-
llraft his altitude out of 90, and the remainder is the fame,
as in this example ; take 59 degrees 51 minutes out of 90
degrees, there remains 30 degrees 9 minutes, being the
dillance.

But for the more ready reckoning or finding the }) ’j
place obferve this little table ; its ufe is, having the num-
ber of figns and degrees that the moon is from the place of
(5 with the fun as before, find the ir number in the row of
figures
( 192 )
figures at the top, and the fign as the 5 was in at (5 , in
the firft column on the left hand, and in a ftraight line to-
wards the right hand, under the figure for the number of
figns, is the fign required; but note, the degrees muft be
added together (if any be) and if they exceed 30, then one
fign more muft be added, and fo many degrees as exceeds 1
30, as in this example; © in n 20 degrees, ]) ’sdiftance
7 figns 16 degrees, look under 7, and ftraight from n is
as it was before, and 16 and 20 added together is ftill
the fame, (viz.) 6 degrees the D ’s place ; fo the like is
to be done at other times, as occafion requires.
