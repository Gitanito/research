  		              		Experience Description   

    I had memory loss caused by the accident, where I couldn't remember anything for a couple of months before and after the accident. 

  When I was lying in the hospital, I experienced pure love. There was no guilt, shame, or compulsion. The only thing that existed was pure, complete, and unconditional love. The love was so good and had answers to everything so that I had  no questions to wonder about. The happiness I felt was total. To have gotten to know this love is the greatest gift I have had in my life.

  The injuries I received were so serious that it is a wonder I am still alive. My knee got off, my pelvis broke both forwards and back, and 10 ribs were broken. My jaw broke in two locations, my spine and cervical vertebrae got fractures, and my head got such a hit that microscopic hemorrhages were all around in my brain.
