T HIS second monograph on the Borley hauntings claims to
be no more than a continuation of the story, with the in­
clusion of all the additional evidence1for the phenomena which
has been collected and collated during the past six years. The
last days of the Rectory are described, and some interesting
theories for the causation of the manifestations have been dis­
cussed.
This book could not have been written without the generous
help and kindly co-operation of a number of friends and contri­
butors, most of whom, I regret to say, I have never met. It is
with much pleasure, therefore, that I am now able publicly to
acknowledge their great services to me and to the cause of
scientific psychical research.
I am indebted to the Rev. A. C. Henning (Rector of Borley-
cum-Liston) and Mrs Henning, and to Miss Ethel Bull and the
Bull family generally, for much hospitality and help during my
frequent visits to the Rectory and its neighbourhood; and Mrs
Norah Walrond, of Thome Lodge, Cockfield, Suffolk, has assisted
me in many ways.
The Rev. Canon W. J. Phythian-Adams, D.D., Canon of
Carlisle, has contributed two invaluable chapters to the book,
and I am grateful for his help. His analytical essays are so im­
portant that it is doubtful whether I should have attempted
another work on the Rectory had it not been for his great interest
in the case.
To Sir Ernest Jelf, formerly Senior Master of the Supreme
Court, and to Sir Albion Richardson, K.C., C.B.E., Recorder of
Nottingham, my especial thanks are due. For the first time in
the annals o f psychical research the opinions of distinguished
jurists have been publicly expressed as to the validity or otherwise
1 All the evidence, witnesses’ statements, original letters, documents, and photo­
graphs, etc., are preserved in the Borley d
o
ssierin the Harry Price Library gfMagical
literature, in the University ofLondon.

of phenomena witnessed in a haunted house. So Borley has made
legal, as well as psychic, history.
Other contributors to whom I am greatly indebted include:
M r A. J. B. Robertson, M.A., of St John’s College, Cambridge,
and his colleagues, for the formation of the Cambridge Commis­
sion of inquiry into the hauntings, and for their Report; Mr and
Mrs Gilbert Hayes; Mrs C. H. B. Gowan; Mrs W. John
Braithwaite; Mr H. F. Russell, of Chelmsford; Mr Percy Pigott;
M r P. Shaw Jeffrey, M.A. ; Surgeon-Lieutenant G. B. Nawrocki;
M r Robert Fordyce Aickman and his friends; Mr A. C. Cooper;
M r Arthur S. Medcraft; and Mr G. P. J. L’Estrange.
For the expert examination of the remains found at Borley I
am grateful to Dr Eric H. Bailey, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., of the
County Hospital, Ashford, Middlesex; Mr Leslie J. Godden,
L.D.S., R.C.S. ; and the Rev. Father M. J. Moriarty, of West­
minster Cathedral. For secretarial work during the excavations
Mrs Ethel English was indispensable, and my thanks are due to
her, and to all those who assisted at the diggings. In this con­
nexion I must mention the Rev. FatherJohn Wright, of S. Philip
Neri, Arundel, who was, perhaps, the first priest to say a Requiem
Mass for the soul o f£Marie Lairre ’—who so often requested it. I
thank him for meeting her wishes.
The value of this monograph has been enhanced by the inclu­
sion of many documentary—and beautiful—photographs, and
the following gentlemen deserve the highest praise and thanks for
their skill: Mr David E. Scherman, of the magazine Life', Mr
Harry Marshall1and MrJ. H. Russell, of Trinity College, Oxford
(who also contribute an account of their experiences at the
Rectory); and Mr Eric G. Calcraft, of Sudbury.
For all the plans of the Rectory, some photographs, and much
expert help in many directions, I have to acknowledge the kind­
ness of Mr Sidney H. Glanville; his daughter, Mrs Helen Carter;
and his son, Squadron-Leader R. H. Glanville. The Glanville
family have aided me consistently during the past eight years of
my investigation, and I am much indebted to them.
1 Those photographs datedJanuary 5, 1944, were taken by Mr Marshall and his
mend.
PREFACE 7
And how can I thank my many correspondents? Their name
is legion, and all, in som
e way, have helped me in my work. A
num
ber of them have been mentioned in the text, and I am
especially grateful to the Rev. Canon Harold Anson, M.A.,
M
aster of the Temple; Emeritus Professor W. B. Stevenson,
D.Litt., D.D., LL.D.; Mr Edwyn R. Bevan, O.B.E., M.A.;
M
rs C. Ryan Baines; Mr C. J. Cave, M.A., J.P., F.S.A.; Mr
H
enry N. Ridley, C.M.G., F.R.S., M.A., F.L.S.; and many
others for suggestions and help. Mrs Georgina Dawson’s
researches into the history ofthe Waldegrave family and Borley
are ascomplete as they are interesting, and I thank herfor send­
ing m
e her records.
I end this Preface on a note of regret. Since my last mono­
graph was published two form
er Rectors of Borley have passed
away. The Rev. G. Eric Smith died on August 3 , 1 9 4 0 , and
the Rev. L. A. Foyster onApril 1 8 , 1 9 4 5 . Both gentlemen were
deeply interested in the Rectory phenomena, and both helped
m
e materially in the preparation of the Borley annals. Readers
w
ill, I know, join me in offering my deepest sympathy to their
respective widows and fam
ilies.

THE STORY OF ‘ THE M OST HAUNTED HOUSE
IN ENGLAND’
I N the concluding words of the preface to my The M ost
Haunted House in England I asserted, in a moment of over-
confidence, that the flames that so nearly consumed Borley
Rectory on the night of February 27-28, 1939, ‘ brought down
the curtain on the most extraordinary and best-documented case
of haunting in the annals of psychical research.’
Well, I was wrong. For ten years I had toiled in an attempt to
solve this psychic puzzle. I imagined that my labours in investi­
gating this most convincing and remarkable case were at an end.
I could not visualize that there was much more to be said than
had been recorded either by me or by my hundred observers—
mostly educated and cultured men and women, who had devoted
their-time, money, and skill to probing the mysteries that have
been associated with the Rectory for more than eighty years.
With the publication of my monograph in 19401 soon realized
that the fiery end of the Rectory did not mean the end o f the
story. And I realized too that my work was not finished. Shoals
of letters (over eight hundred to date) began to reach m e: letters
asking for information, letters containing suggestions, theories,
new interpretations, and— ofvital importance— letters imparting
new information and new evidence. Some of this evidence dates
back more than half a century. And I found that new intellects
were being brought to bear on Borley and its problems.
Brilliant thinkers, such as Sir Ernest Jelf, formerly King’s
Remembrancer (and Senior Master of the Supreme Court);
Dr W . J. Phythian-Adams, Canon of Carlisle; and Sir Albion
Richardson, K .C ., C.B.E., were studying the case academically
and analysing the phenomena— with what results the reader of
this volume will be made aware ofin due course. In addition to all
this intense interest in Borley and its invisible (and, occasionally,
13
T H E E N D OF B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
14
visible) entities, there were discovered new documents that shed
a flood of light on our findings, and confirmed some of our
theories.
But perhaps what surprised me most was the fact that the
phenomena at the Rectory were continuing. Intelligent observers
who visited the ruins reported the recurrence of most of the old
phenomena, and some new ones. Amid the burnt and blackened
beams of the upper storey were heard the familiar paranormal
footsteps and the familiar door-slamming— though there was very
little to walk on and no doors to slam. And the famous Borley
‘ nun,’ or her shadow, was seen again. Stranger still, a distin­
guished business man was ‘jumped upon5by a weighty invisible
that bore him to the ground— in a pool of muddy water. There
was nothing ambiguous about this: it was in broad daylight, and
the victim was accompanied by his two sons, officers in the R .A .F.
I cite these few incidents in order to emphasize that the ghosts of
Borley were by no means ‘ dead5
— fire or no fire.
As these reports began to accumulate it became increasingly
obvious that a supplementary statement would be needed, a
‘ sequel5to, or continuation of, The Most Haunted House in England,
a new edition of which, it was suggested, might be issued with an
account of the latest developments. Then came Canon Phythian-
Adams’s clever analysis of the case, and the exciting sequel. The
Cambridge Commission, too (see Chapter IX ), issued a long and
detailed report on its findings. All this new material was too
great, and certainly much too important, to incorporate in a
new edition of the first Borley monograph, and so a new book
was decided upon. Here it is.
To make the present report completely intelligible to new
readers and to those unacquainted with the Borley story, it is
necessary for me to give a synopsis of the events that occurred
at Borley Rectory between the years 1863 and 1939, the period
covered by my first book. But this general view of the Borley
hauntings is a mere epitome of the phenomena. For a full,
critical, and detailed examination of all the incidents, with the
names of the many observers who recorded them, the original
monograph must be consulted. Unfortunately, this seems to have
F I R E A T M E L F O R D H A L L 15
disappeared completely from the market— even the second-hand
book market— though.copies are to be found in most public and
circulating libraries. M y advice to the reader is to obtain a copy
if possible, as it and the present volume are complementary to
each other, though each is complete in itself. It is hoped to
reprint The M ost Haunted House in England in due course. To those
who are unable to secure a copy of this first report, the following
conspectus of events, from 1863 to 1939, will enable them to
follow intelligently the account of all that has happened at Borley
Rectory dining the past six years.
Before I begin my narrative I must first answer a question
that is often put to m e: Who first called the Rectory ‘ the most
haunted house’ ? I do not know. On my first visit to the house,
on June 12, 1929, as I swung my car into the market square at
Sudbury, I found I had come to the end of my instructions for
finding the Rectory and was at a loss how to proceed. I inquired
from a bystander how I could get to Borley Rectory. *O h,’ he
said, ‘ you mean the most haunted house in England.’ And that
is how-and where I first heard the phrase. I was to hear it many
times afterwards.
Borley, I found, was two and a half miles from Sudbury,
Suffolk. The river Stour flows through the parish of Borley,
dividing the counties of Suffolk and Essex. Borley is on the
Essex (the north or right) bank of the river. In 1931 the parish
contained 121 inhabitants. I am under the impression that the
population has since decreased, which is hardly surprising.
Borley is also about two miles from Long M elford,1 Suffolk, a
long and charming village containing Melford Hall, the home of
Sir William Hyde Parker. His residence too was badly damaged
by fire on February 21, 1942, when a famous Henry V III bed­
stead was destroyed, and priceless Tudor and Queen Anne furni­
ture was burned.2 The nearest stations to Borley are at Sudbury
and Long Melford, some sixty miles from London on the London
and North-eastern Railway.
1The term ‘ Long Melford’ connotes a ‘ soft leather bag in which farmers and
countrymen carried their money to market.’— Sunday Times, April 16, iqoq.
2The Observer, February 33, 194a.
l 6 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
As Borley Church (dedication unknown) plays a prominent
part in my narrative, I will describe it. It is a small building of
stone in the Early English style, with traces of Saxon work in the
embattled western tower, which contains two bells (dated 1574,
and 1723 respectively). The registers date from 1652 (baptisms),
1656 (burials), and 1709 (marriages). I include these details in
case any reader wishes to do some original research work at
Borley. When I first knew the parish the living was worth £225
a year, with ten acres of glebe and the Rectory, in the gift of the
executors of the Rev. Henry F. Bull (known as Harry Bull), who
figures so largely in these pages. In 1935 the living was com­
bined with that of the neighbouring parish of Liston. The Rev.
A . C. Henning is now in charge of both parishes, and resides at
Liston Rectory.
Much of the land at Borley belongs to the Bulls, and they were
a family of parsons. Henry D. E. Bull (bom in 1833) was Rector
of Borley, and built the famous Rectory in 1863. It was a two-
storeyed monstrosity in red brick. On account of his rapidly
increasing family, he added a wing in 1875-76. This increased
the accommodation by several rooms, which now numbered
about thirty, with large and rambling cellars. The Rectory was
built on the site of a much older building— probably a previous
rectory— belonging to the Herringham family, and during our
investigations we traced the foundations and footings of the
former house. The bricks were of the ancient two-inch type.
There is a generally accepted tradition that a monastery once
occupied the site, but we have failed to find any confirmation of
this.
Harry Bull, Henry’s son, also entered the Church, and became
curate to his father (it was his third curacy). When Henry Bull
died in 1892 he was naturally succeeded by his son, Harry, who
became Rector. Harry died in 1927. Father and son between
them held the living for an unbroken period of sixty-five years.
Upon the death of Harry in 1927 the Bull family tried to find
a new rector. They had some difficulty. The large, ugly,
rambling, and inconvenient Rectory, with few amenities (neither
gas nor electric light, and water pumped by hand), was not
‘ f i f t e e n m o n t h s in a h a u n t e d h o u s e ’ 17
every one’s choice. I believe that about a dozen clergy and their
wives visited the place, saw, hesitated, promised to think it over
— and finally refused. Probably their wives decided for them.
And the Rectory was acquiring a ‘ reputation.’
However, after sixteen months’ search a new Rector was
found. This was the Rev. G. Eric Smith, who, with his wife,
took up residence at the Rectory in the autumn of 1928. M r
Smith was inducted on October 2, 1928. They had no children.
Nine months later, on July 14, 1929, the Smiths vacated the
Rectory. They found it impossible to live there owing to the
lack of amenities, to say nothing of the amazing and disconcert­
ing things that were happening in their home. They went to
live at Long Melford for a few months, finally quitting the dis­
trict in April 1930.
Again the Rectory was empty for some six months. But, most
opportunely, a cousin of the Bulls, deciding to give up his nine­
teen years’ missionary work in Canada, arrived in England and
was inducted to the living in October 1930. The new Rector was
the Rev. L. A . Foyster, M .A .,1 a cultured and charming man,
who, with his equally charming wife, ‘ stuck it’ for the (in the
circumstances) long period of exactly five years. They left in
October 1935. How they remained there five minutes is remark­
able, because on the very first day of their residence M r Foyster
records in his diary: ‘ A voice calling Marianne's [his wife’s]
name; footsteps heard by self, Marianne, Adelaide [a little
adopted daughter], and man working in the house. “ Harry
Bull” seen at different times by Marianne. . . . ’ A book could be
written on what the Foysters experienced during their five years’
stay at Borley Rectory. In fact, M r Foyster did write a book
dealing with the worst period of their residence there. It is called
Fifteen Months in a Haunted House, and describes many hundreds o f
phenomena— a few amusing, many terrifying, and all inexpli­
cable. M r Foyster hoped to get it published one day. He also
kept a day-to-day diary in which he recorded all these strange
happenings. I will reproduce some extracts later.
When the Foysters vacated the Rectory Queen Anne’s Bounty

l 8 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
decided to sell the place, as they considered it unfit for a parson
to live in. So they offered it to m e! They wanted only £500 for
it. This was cheap, as the house cost about £3000 to build, and
there were, I think, some three acres of garden, etc., a cottage,
and other buildings. I hesitated about buying it because I live
i50 miles from Borley, and the place would have been a liability.
I did not mind its ‘ terrible’ reputation. That alone was worth
£500— to a psychical researcher. So I contented myself with
renting the Rectory for a year. It was sold eventually to a
Captain W . H . Gregson, and during his occupation the place
went up in smoke, at midnight of February 27-28, 1939, after
the ‘ spirits’ had threatened to destroy it by fire. As the reader
will learn, what was not burned down was finally blown down
and pulled down. To-day not one brick stands upon another.
However, I possess about two hundred photographs of it, in its
entirety and at various stages of its disintegration— an invaluable
pictorial record which is being preserved for posterity, together
with all the documents, plans, protocols, reports, Press cuttings,
and letters pertaining to the case. The dossier is a vast one.
I have now given a brief history of the Rectory, to date/ As I
have stated, the living has been joined with that of Liston, and
Borley-cum-Liston is its present title, which is not likely to be
changed. It is highly improbable that a new Rectory will ever
be erected at Borley. If it is I hope it will be built on the old site
— and I hope I shall be alive to watch results l •
How I was introduced to Borley and its phenomena can be
told in a few words. On June 11, 1929, the News Editor of the
Daily Mirror telephoned to me, saying that the Rev. G. E. Smith
had appealed to him for help. The most extraordinary things
were happening at his Rectory: bells were ringing of their own
volition; strange lights were seen in empty and locked rooms in
the Rectory; the famous ‘ nun’ (of whom more anon) had been
seen again; slow, dragging footsteps were heard across the floor
of an unoccupied room; a young maidservant, imported from
London, had left after two days’ work; and her successor declared
that she saw an old-fashioned coach, drawn by two brown horses,
T H E ‘ C H A T T E R I N G M E N ’ IQ
gallop through the hedge, sweep across the lawn— and vanish
into thin air. She, too, saw the nun leaning over a gate near the
house.
The editor told me that he had already sent a representative,
Mr V . C. W all, to the Rectory, and asked me whether I would
join him and take charge of the case. I said yes— with alacrity—
little dreaming that, sixteen years later, I should still be engaged
on the problem.
M y F irst V isit t o t h e R e c t o r y
M y secretary and I arrived at the Rectory on Wednesday,
June 12, 1929, and, over lunch, M r and Mrs Smith related their
adventures. They confirmed M r W all’s accounts,1 with more
detailed information. One summer afternoon M r Smith heard
distinct sibilant whisperings on the landing, over his head. He
was alone in the house, and the sounds followed him as he
walked. They were heard many times during their residence.
Later he heard a woman’s voice crying pitifully, ‘ Don’t, Carlos,
don’t !’ the words tailing away into a sort of muttering.2 Mrs
Smith too heard ‘ voices’ and, more terrifying, frequently saw a
dark and shadowy figure leaning over one of the drive-gates.
Whenever she attempted to investigate the figure instantly
vanished. Another strange phenomenon was the sudden and
simultaneous projection of the keys from their locks. Several
rooms opened out on to the hall and adjacent passages. The

2Mr Henry N. Ridley, C.M.G., F.R.S., M .A., F.L.S., the distinguished botanist,
draws my attention to a similar and well-authenticated phenomenon which he.
personally, has heard in the Malay Peninsula. It is known as the ‘ Orang Bunian*
(literally, ‘ men making a noise*—i . e chattering) or the ‘ talking men.’ He says,
‘ I met tkis remarkable phenomenon at Toas, in Western Singapore, while inspecting
forests.. . . At one point I heard quite distinctly the voices of people coming towards
me from the north. The whole place was covered with forest for miles on both
sides of the track, and there were no villages or houses for about a day’s march.
The words o f the voices were indistinguishable, but the sound was as if about half a
dozen men were talking together.* The^ voices were located at one spot only.
Mr Ridley^ walked right round them. His men were very nervous, as they were
familiar with the phenomenon. He discovered that perhaps fifty or sixty years
previously there had been a village at the spot, though all traces, except a few fruit-
trees, had disappeared. No one living had seen the village. M r Ridley’s inquiries
elicited the fact that in the north of the island the ‘voices’ were much louder, due
to the fact that the vanished villages had been larger. M r Ridley was completely
satisfied that the ‘ voices’ he heard were paranormal ones.
2 0 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
locks had keys, and frequently, in full light, some of the keys
would suddenly be propelled from their locks, simultaneously. I
witnessed this typical Poltergeist phenomenon once, when, I
think, four of the keys were shot out in this way. O f course
I examined everything, but there was no normal explanation.
Trickery was impossible.
Poltergeist phenomena were frequent during the Smiths’ resi­
dence, and some damage was done. An expensive vase that
normally stood on a bedroom mantelpiece was found smashed to
pieces at the foot of the main stairs.
A Gruesome Find
One morning, when Mrs Smith was turning out the library
cupboard, she found a small brown-paper parcel neatly tied up
with string. She had not noticed it before, and proceeded to
undo it. She was shocked to discover a small skull, in perfect
condition, with all the teeth in situ. Medical opinion pronounced
the skull to be that of a young woman. No one knew whose skull
it was, where it came from, or how it got into the cupboard.
Finally it was reverently buried in the churchyard, the mystery
still unsolved. According to M r Hardy, a foreman painter at
Borley, the skull ‘ had been lying about the house for a long time.
Once it was buried, but the phenomena increased to such an
extent that it was restored to the Rectory.’ This story can be
exactly paralleled by one that Colonel Henry M . Hardcastle, of
Bradshaw Hall, Bolton, related to m e.1
T he Story of the Nun
It was over lunch that we heard the full account of the legends
and traditions connected with the Rectory. The principal story
is that, in the thirteenth century, a beautiful young novice from
the nunnery at Bures, seven miles from Borley, fell in love with
one of the lay brothers at Borley Monastery. They eloped in a
black coach drawn by a pair of bay horses, driven by another lay
brother; were missed by their respective superiors; were chased

and caught— and a terrible punishment speedily followed. The
would-be bridegroom was hanged, and the girl was bricked up
alive in her own convent— after the awful words cVade in Pace5
had been pronounced. History does not relate what happened
to the driver of the coach.
This is a pretty story— with some snags: (a) There is no
evidence that a monastery ever existed at Borley; (6) there is
little evidence that a nunnery ever existed at Bures, though I
will refer to this in later pages; (c) coaches, black or otherwise,
were not invented until the beginning of the fifteenth century,
and were then used only by ladies of the first rank; and (d) there
is no evidence at all that nuns were ever immured alive in this
country. That girls suffered this cruel death in some parts of the
world is well established. During classical times the vestal virgins
were immured for unchastity; and burial alive was the punish­
ment meted out, in Egypt, to the cvestals5of Isis who broke their
vows. This question is fully discussed in The Most Haunted House
in England.
• If we can dismiss the legends about the nun we certainly can­
not dismiss the lady herself. That she has been seen at Borley,
in the grounds or near the house, by many observers is as certain
as that the sun will rise to-morrow morning. The nun has been
seen over and over again by various cultured and intelligent
people. And my evidence, in time, ranges from 1885 to 1943. I
have the evidence of at least seventeen people 'that they saw,
singly or collectively, the figure or apparition of the nun. Some
of my witnesses saw her several times. The coach, too, has been
seen by intelligent observers— but no one has yet been able to
find any link between nun and coach, except the traditional one.
A St r a n g e G a r d e n
Like the nun who used to haunt Ballechin House, Perthshire,1
the Borley phantasm does not like being under cover. She prefers
the open spaces, though never straying far from the Rectory. Her
favourite walk was a long path that skirted the lawn (see Plan I).
This was-r-and still is— known as the Nun’s Walk, a name it

24 TH E END OF B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
acquired some fifty years ago. Facing the Nun’s Walk, on the
other side of the lawn, is a large octagonal summer-house, very
well built, that was erected by the Rev. Henry Bull for the
special purpose of watching the nun (see Plate IV). Nearly half
of the upper portion of the structure is unboarded, in order that
a very wide angle ofview can be obtained by any observer sitting
on the continuous seating that runs round the interior periphery
of the summer-house. It was here that both Harry and Henry
Bull used to sit for hours on end, smoking their pipes, and just
watching.
If special arrangements were made for viewing the nun in
comfort steps were also taken to prevent her from seeing the
inmates ofthe Rectory at unseasonable hours. O f all the strange
things connected with Borley (where everything is strange), one
of the strangest is the fact that Henry Bull had the principal
window of the dining-room bricked up (see ground-floor plan)
because the nun used to stare at them from the drive while they
were eating their meals. She used to stand there with her face
close up against the glass, wistfully gazing at the inmates. So the
Rector had this window (the only one facing north) permanently
bricked up. When I first saw the curious sight I at once thought
ofthe Window Tax. But this was repealed in 1851— twelve years
before the Rectory was built. (Thewindow isshown in Plate III.)
Though the Nun’s Walk was her favourite haunting-ground,
she used to frequent the lawn, various parts of the garden, the
courtyard, the road outside the house, and, as we have seen, the
drive. With one possible exception (to be referred to later in
this volume), she was never seen in the Rectory. She has been
seen in daylight, sunlight, at dawn and at dusk— but never, I
think, by artificial light.
In addition to the strange summer-house, there were other
unusual things in the very strange garden and grounds of Borley
Rectory. One of them was a pseudo-Gothic summer-house that
looked most out of place at the end of the garden (see Plan I), a
long way from the house. Still stranger was a cats’ cemetery,
where a collection of dead felines had been interred from time to
time. Head-boards, recording the demise of ‘ Gem,’ ‘ Rollo,’
A S T R A N G E W E L L 25
‘ Sandy/ and other pets, were placed in a circle, in orderly
formation. Then a curious thing occurred. During my tenancy
of the place my chief collaborator, M r Sidney H . Glanville,
noticed on one of his observational periods (August 14, 1937)
that the head-board o fcGem 5 had been removed and flung into
the bushes, and that the graves had been disturbed. Some one
had taken the trouble to dig up a portion of the cemetery, and
an area the size of a small room had been turned over. Near-by
bushes and the grass had been trampled upon, and the fresh
earth was spread around. As no one had any right to enter the
grounds except my official observers and myself, M r Glanville
made some inquiries. No one knew anything about the matter.
Obviously a stranger had entered the garden at night and had
dug up the area known as the ‘ cats5cemetery.5
So M r Glanville thought he would do some digging himself.
He and his son Roger redug the whole area and uncovered a lot
of large bones— bones that might once have formed part of the
anatomy of horses or oxen, but which certainly never belonged
to the Felis domestica. A few they could not identify.1 The
mystery was never solved. Did the nocturnal digger bury some­
thing, or dig up something? Was he removing the traces of some
crime? Had his visit anything to do with the Borley story? Was
it a human being or a Poltergeist that made such havoc with
the cemetery and the garden? W e don’t know. Anyway, the
intruder must have had the strongest of reasons for spending
several hours of darkness in a strange garden, working hard and
disinterring a few family pets. This is just another*of the many
Borley mysteries.
Another mystery is in connexion with the main well. This is
in the courtyard formed by the rectangular shape of the house,
and is of the usual circular bricked type. It is six feet in diameter
and eighty feet deep. M r Glanville, who investigated the well,
found that at 61*9 feet his flare and sinker were sucked or blown
into a considerable cavity or tunnel leading out of the wall of the
well on the side nearest the house. This means, of course, that
the level of the water cannot rise higher than eighteen feet from
1See Chapter X IV for a suggested theory concerning these bones.
26 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
the bottom. A few feet below the top of the well was a staging
made of rotten and slimy timbers, and some of the more adven­
turous spirits among our observers attempted to use this as a
jumping-offground for sliding down the steel shaft that connects
the pump proper with the hand-wheel mechanism at the well­
head (see Plate X III). The object was, of course, to explore
the tunnel many feet below. However, the project was aban­
doned because it would have been easy— fatally easy— to slide
down the greasy shaft, but most difficult to have climbed up
again. In fact, one man did slip, and nearly fell in, head first.
This brings me to the question as to whether there are under­
ground tunnels under or near the Rectory. A variant of the
nun-and-elopement legend is that the young lady traversed the
seven miles from Bures Nunnery to Borley by means of an under­
ground tunnel that connected the two. This would have been a
feat of the first magnitude. But, as Goethe says, ‘ Love can do
much, ’ so perhaps we would accept this remarkable walk were
we able to accept the legend. The whole point is whether the
tunnels exist or not.
I stated in my first Borley book that remains of these tunnels
had been found at various places near the Rectory, and that the
Rev. G. E. Smith, one of the incumbents, had actually stumbled
across a caved-in portion of a tunnel or secret passage in the
Rectory grounds. He had the cavity filled in. I also said that
portions of a tunnel had been found in the grounds of Borley
Place, just opposite the Rectory. I spoke, too, of the apparent
‘ hollowness’ of the road in front of the Rectory. It is a fact that
the sounds made by people walking along this road, or horses
trotting, appear louder than on other portions of the same road.
When my book appeared I had a number of letters casting
doubt on the fact that such tunnels ever existed; or, if they did,
then they were ancient bricked sewers, or cloaca, that served for
the primitive sanitation of our ancestors. But quite recently the
Rev. A. G. Henning, the present Rector of Borley-cum-Liston,
has informed me that he had just interviewed a Borley man, a
M r Tarrance, who has not only seen the tunnel, but has actually
entered it. The Rev. Harry Bull employed Tarrance (who is still
A P O L T E R G E I S T D R O P S A B R I C K 2 7
living) to examine and repair a well in the garden of Borley
Place. During the repairs Tarrance came across some brickwork
a few feet below the ground. With his pick he forced an entrance
through the bricks and found himself in a tunnel, ‘ high and
dome-shaped,5built of two-inch bricks. He explored the passage
for some distance, but could not see where it led to, and passed
no opinion as to what it could have been used for. But he was
certain that it was not a sewer. It was several years ago when
Tarrance discovered the tunnel, but doubtless it is still there.
F irst P h e n o m e n a
After lunch, when we had heard about the Smiths5adventures,
and the Borley legends, my secretary and I made a complete and
minute survey of the house from top to bottom. We sealed all
doors and windows that we could not control personally. W e
examined the grounds and outbuildings, and sent the maid home.
Then we had tea.
After tea, when it was dusk, M r Wall and I stood at the
entrance of the large summer-house— he to watch for the nun,
I on -the look-out for the strange light said to appear in the
window o f Room No. 7. Suddenly, after about an hour, my
companion declared that a shadow was moving along the Nun's
Walk. I too thought I saw the shadow, but could not be sure.
I did not see the light in the window.
By this time it was quite dark, so we decided to return to the
house. As we were passing under the glass-topped veranda half
a brick crashed through the roof and smothered us with splinters.
We searched, but found no explanation of the occurrence.
Our first task when we entered the house was again to search
thoroughly the entire building from attics to cellars. We found
all my seals intact. As we reached the hall again a red-glass
candlestick hurtled down the well of the Rectory and smashed
at our feet. We ran upstairs again and found that the ornament
was one of a pair normally reposing on the mantelpiece of the
Blue Room (Room No. 6), one of the bedrooms in which many
phenomena occurred. We again searched the place from top to
bottom, but found no sign of a living thing. (The house was well
28 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
lighted with Duplex paraffin lamps.) Then we were pelted with
mothballs, pebbles, bits of slate, etc. All these missiles came
from the upper storey, which we again explored without result.
Later several of the bells (of the old-fashioned type) rang of their
own volition, and we could actually see the pulls moving, though
not what was pulling them. Then the keys of the library and
drawing-room fell simultaneously to the floor. We could find no
explanation of these truly Poltergeist phenomena.
Later that evening we held a séance in the famous Blue Room,
with curious results. Under the strong light of a Duplex lamp,
we heard incessant raps coming from the wooden back of a large
mirror that stood on the dressing-table. By means of the time-
honoured code of three raps for yes, etc. (a code that, apparently,
all ‘ spirits’ understand), we held a long conversation with an
entity which declared it was cHarry Bull.3 Suddenly we heard
something fall at the fa r end of the room, the door of which was
closed. We investigated, and found that a new cake of soap had
jumped out of its dish on the washstand and had fallen heavily
on to the edge of the water ewer on the floor, making a deep dent.
No one was nearer the washstand than twelve feet away; The
séance ended at 4 a .m . on June 13, 1929. The Rev. Harry Bull
died in the Blue Room. So did his father and mother.
S im u lta n e o u s V ie w o f t h e N u n in Su n l ig h t
Next morning I visited the Misses Bull, the surviving sisters
of the Rev. Harry Bull, who live at Sudbury. From them I heard
accounts of phenomena which they had experienced during
their life at the Rectory. Especially interesting was their account
o f how they met the nun— in sunlight. They were returning
from a garden-party on July 28,1 1900, and, as they entered the
grounds of the Rectory, saw a young woman in the garb of a
mm, telling her beads with bowed head, as she half walked, half
glided, along the Nun’s Walk. The three sisters (Ethel, Freda,
and Mabel), then young women, were petrified with fear. They
stood by the summer-house and watched her. One of the girls
fetched another sister, Elsie. The four of them stood staring at
- 1 It is alleged that the nun can always be seen on this particular day of the year.

the nun. Then Elsie made a movement as if to approach her.
The figure stopped, turned her face towards the group, and
instantly vanished. She had ‘ an expression of intense grief on
her face.5
I interviewed, separately, three of the witnesses of this extra­
ordinary phenomenon, and their testimony agreed in every detail.
The fault with most ghost stories is that the apparition is generally
seen under bad conditions of lighting, and usually by one person
only. For an apparently solid, three-dimensional, objective
ghost to be seen simultaneously by four people, in sunlight, is
concrete evidence that cannot be explained away.
Other phenomena heard and seen at the Rectory by the Bull
family include paranormal bell-ringing; raps all over the house;
footsteps tramping up and down stairs; and phantasms ofvarious
shapes. One night Miss Ethel Bull met a tall, dark man in one
of the passages. He vanished. One day the Bull sisters saw a girl
in white going to the river Stour. She too vanished. They had
many such experiences, all inexplicable.
Miss Ethel Bull related to me an account of some of the
phenomena seen and heard by her brother, the Rev. Harry Bull,
during his long sojourn in the Rectory. One night he was in the
garden, when his retriever, Juvenal, started howling, at the same
time ‘ pointing5at some trees. The Rector then saw a pair oflegs
moving behind the trees. The upper part of the figure was ob­
scured by the branches. When the figure came into the open he
noticed that it was headless! The phantasm passed right through
a closed wicket, across the vegetable garden, where it dis­
appeared. Once Harry Bull saw a little wizened old man stand­
ing on the lawn. He could see his features very plainly, and he at
once realized that the man was identical in every way with an
old retainer of the family who had died some two hundred years
previously. His name was ‘ Old Amos,5 and he was employed
as a gardener. Old Amos was an eccentric character, and an
account of his doings, with details of his appearance, was
handed down from generation to generation.
Harry Bull also saw, more than once, the famous coach and
bays. They always suddenly completely and mysteriously
T H E N U N S E E N M A N Y T I M E S 31
vanished. Once he heard the familiar clatter of hoofs and rumb­
ling of the wheels on the roadway as he was entering one of the
drive-gates. The sounds (only) passed him. The reader will learn
later how Mr P. Shaw Jeffrey also heard the traditional coach
many times while staying with the Bulls at Borley, in 1885—
86.
Many othei; people have heard the rumbling of the coach, especi­
ally in front of the Rectory, where, as I have stated, the roadway
appears to have been built over a tunnel.
T h e Pa d d in g cD o g 5
As we were in Sudbury, we visited Mr Edward Cooper, who
has been in the employ of the Bull family for many years. When
they lived at Borley he and his wife occupied the ‘ cottage9near
the Rectory. They told us an astonishing story. Nearly every
night, from April 1916, for a period of about three years, when
they retired to rest, they heard a pattering sound coming from
the adjoining kitchen. It sounded like a large dog padding
round the room. One night they heard a terrific crash in the
kitchen and thought all their china had been smashed. Mr
Cooper leapt out ofbed, lit a candle, and ran to the kitchen. But
not a thing had been disturbed, and from that night onward the
‘ padding’ noise ceased.
Early one morning in 1919 the Coopers, as they lay in bed,
saw a little black shape, in the form of a man, running round the
bedroom. As Mr Cooper jumped out of bed the figure vanished.
The cnun9has been seen many times by the Coopers. They have
seen her crossing the courtyard, in the road, full-face and side-
face. They have seen her walk, but never heard her footsteps.
Her perambulations were confined strictly to the immediate vici­
nity of the Rectory.
The most startling of the phenomena seen by Mr Cooper was
the traditional coach. One bright moonlight night he was un­
dressing for bed, and, happening to glance out of the window, he
saw lights rapidly approaching the cottage. Wondering what
the lights were doing in the Church meadow opposite, he gazed
in astonishment as he realized that they were the head-lamps of
an old-fashioned black coach drawn by two horses. On the box
32 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
seat were two figures in high top-hats. The metal trappings of
the horses glittered in the moonlight, and everything was per­
fectly visible. The coach swept on, through the hedge, across
the road, and into the Rectory farmyard, where it disappeared.
It was quite noiseless, and passed through all obstacles.
T h e W a it in g N un
About twelve months later I again visited Sudbury, still seek­
ing first-hand evidence for the paranormal happenings at the
Rectory. I was directed to the lodgings of a journeyman car­
penter named Fred Cartwright, who told me a curious story. He
was repairing some farm buildings near Borley and used to pass
the Rectory every morning on his way to work, just as it was
getting light. This was in the early autumn of 1927, when no
one was occupying the house. On the second day he saw a Sister
of Mercy standing outside the Rectory by the first (from Sudbury)
drive-gate. She looked normal and did not speak, and Cart­
wright went on his way. He wondered what she was waiting for.
This was on a Tuesday. On the following Friday morning, at
the same time and place, he saw her again. She seemed tired,
and her eyeswere closed. But he still thought that shewas human.
The third time he saw her, at the same hour and place, was on the
following Wednesday. She again had her eyes closed, as in sleep,
and as he passed her he noticed that she seemed tired and ill. He
thought he would ask her whether she needed assistance. He
suddenly turned to do so, but she had vanished. She made no
sound, and he concluded that she had noiselessly entered the
Rectory, which was unoccupied, though he did not know it. The
last time he saw the nun was on the following Friday morning,
and she was still standing by the drive-gate. As he approached
he decided to say ‘ Good morning’ to her. But before he reached
the gate she had gone. He did not actually see her vanish, but
one moment she was there, the next she was not. Thoroughly
puzzled, he opened the gate— with difficulty— and explored the
drive and the grounds. There was no sign of her. It was not
until he related the incident to his friends at Sudbury that he
learned the story of the Rectory.

P heno m ena t o O r d e r
I visited the Rectory several times in 1929 and witnessed many
phenomena under perfect conditions of control. In addition to
the incessant paranormal bell-ringing, I saw showers of pebbles
and keys coming from nowhere, and on one occasion a Roman
Catholic medallion, and a badge struck during the French
Revolution, came tumbling down the stairs in a good light.
Also, we managed to obtain phenomena at request We asked
the centities5to ring one of the house bells for us, and it was rung
— under perfect control. When the Smiths moved out of the
Rectory to furnished lodgings at near-by Long Melford they
kindly kept me informed as to what was happening. Their
furniture, stored in the Rectory, was flung about. Once, when
they visited the place, all the bells rang simultaneously— whether
as a welcoming peal or as a noisy protest at their return was not
clear. Sometimes windows in the locked Rectory would be found
open, though they had been securely fastened. Once half a fire­
place had been removed from one of the rooms, and was found
on the main staircase— also the resting-place of lumps of stone
which could not be identified. Villagers reported that the
window of Room No. 7 of the unoccupied Rectory still 'lighted
up5 at nights. On their last visit to the Rectory, before they
removed to Sheringham, Mr Smith wrote to me, 6We heard the
most horrible sounds in the house.5
P oltergeists sta r t a N e w E r a
It was eighteen months before I again visited the Rectory.
For much of this period the place had been unoccupied. But I
received reports from my friends and others at Borley, and was
kept informed as to what was happening there. Then came the
Foysters— and pandemonium! The Poltergeists excelled them­
selves ! The Rev. Lionel A. Foyster kindly asked me to investi­
gate once again, and some members of the National Laboratory
of Psychical Research (of which I was then Honorary Director)
and I visited the Rectory on October 13, 1931. We heard an
astonishing story. Not only was there a recrudescence of all
the old phenomena (in a much more violent form), but the
c
34 T H E e n d o f b o r l e y r e c t o r y
Poltergeists devised many new "manifestations,5 all intended
to perplex, annoy, or injure the unfortunate residents of the
Rectory.
The household consisted of M r Foyster, his wife Marianne,
and a little adopted daughter, Adelaide, who was about three
and a half years old at this period. There was also a little boy
of the same age. They were a most charming family, and I felt
sorry for them. M r Foyster was a Cambridge man (Master of
Arts of Pembroke College), and, being a scholar, set about
keeping an orderly record of all the paranormal happenings that
occurred. He not only kept a diary, but also wrote up the major
portion of the disturbances, in narrative form, under the title of
Fifteen Months in a Haunted House>as I have stated. I will include
some of his amazing experiences in a later chapter.
Having introduced ourselves, we examined the house from top
to bottom. I felt quite at home there and noticed few alterations,
except that the room over the porch had been turned into an
oratory or chapel, with altar, etc., and a stained-glass window.
W h a t a R e l ic d id
After some refreshments we again examined the house. As
we reached the study an empty claret bottle was hurled down
the staircase well, smashing at our feet. At the same moment
one of the bells rang violently. W e rushed upstairs again, but
could not account for the phenomena. Then a further outbreak
of bell-ringing, and small pebbles rattled down the stairs. Mrs
Foyster had retired to rest. Suddenly she called out in alarm.
W e ran to her aid and found that she had been locked in her
bedroom, though, we were informed, the key had been missing
for a long time. M r Foyster was not unduly alarmed, because it
was not unusual for his wife to be "miraculously5 locked in in
that way. And he had another "key5that would open the door.
Up then fetched a relic of Jean-Baptiste Vianney, the saintly
Curé of Ars. W e all knelt down in the passage (Mrs Foyster
kneeling on her side of the door), and the Rector reverently
recited a reliquary prayer. Then we all joined in saying the
Lord’s Prayer, and as he touched the door with the relic we
P O L T E R G E I S T I N C E N D I A R I E S 3 5
heard the bolt of the lock suddenly shoot back! It was an im -
pressive ceremony.1
Though it was a long time before I again visited the Rectory
(I disliked disturbing the Foysters5 home), I was always in
touch with what was happening there, and was assiduously
collecting evidence for the amazing happenings that were of
daily and nightly occurrence at the Rectory. Hundreds of these
phenomena were recorded in the Rector’s diary, a copy of which
he sent me. Several pages of it are reproduced in The M ost
Haunted House in England.
I also collected the evidence of other and independent wit­
nesses of the phenomena, Chief among them were Sir George
and Lady Whitehouse, whose residence, Arthur Hall, is near
Sudbury. They both saw some extraordinary things. Once they
visited the Rectory and found the contents of a cupboard strewn
all over the kitchen. Then the row of bells began clanging, and
they saw pieces of paper, bearing cryptic messages appealing to
"Marianne5 for help, which had fluttered down from nowhere.
At this period similar messages were found scribbled on the walls
— one of the major mysteries connected with Borley (see Plate
V I);
Sir George and his wife were making a tour of the house when
they suddenly smelt wood burning. They ran upstairs and found
the skirting-board of a locked and empty room ablaze. They
fetched water from the bathroom and put it out. Then a large
flint fell on them; then another, which hit Sir George.
A N o v e l E x o r c is m
Lady Whitehouse then exorcized the house by means of burn­
ing lavender (M r Foyster usually employed creosote for this
1Bessie Roy, the Scottish witch, was accused of opening locks by enchantment.
This was in 1590. In the same year John Fean, a more notable sorcerer, was con­
victed of the same crime, ‘ by blawing in ane woman’s handis, himselff sittand at the
iyresyde. * For both trials see the Records o f the C ourt o f Justicia ry (Edinburgh in MS.)
Among the miraculous faculties attributed to St Golumba in the sixth century is
that o f opening locks without a key: Ecclesiam sib i non apertam salva sera, sine clave,

frequently without a key, by merely imprinting the sign of the cross.*) See L ife o f
S t Columba, by the Irish saint and historian Adamnan (c. 624- 704), edited by J. T .
Fowler (Oxford, 1894), Chapters 36, 37.
36 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
purpose), the immediate result of which was a shower of small
pebbles. Then the row of bells began ringing. All this occurred
on M ay 4, 1931.
On the following June 8 Lady Whitehouse again visited the
Rectory. As she entered the house things were falling about.
Mrs Foyster was in bed, unwell. Lady Whitehouse went up to
see her in her bedroom and put her gloves and parasol on the
bed. She went to get some clothes when a cry from Mrs Foyster
caused her to turn. Her gloves and parasol had ‘ flown5 across
the room and were now on the dressing-table! Then a small bottle
jumped from the middle of the room and fell at her feet. She
turned to leave the room when she heard a shriek and found that
the Rector’s wife had been thrown out of bed— the third time
that day.
A n A n s w e r t o a P r a y e r
Lady Whitehouse has a nephew, Dom Richard Whitehouse,
O .S.B., who has known the Rectory and its successive occupants
since boyhood. Between June and December 1931 (the period
when the Poltergeists were most active) he paid some thirty
visits to the Foysters and saw the most astounding phenomena.
He kindly wrote a detailed account of his experiences for my
first Borley book.
Among the many manifestations he witnessed was the flight
of a brass stiletto that rose from the floor and settled on his lap.
He and Mrs Foyster recited the Rosary and sprinkled the rooms
with holy water in an attempt to stop the phenomena. This
was the day (June 8, 1931) on which Mrs Foyster was thrown
out of bed three times. After the stiletto came a vanity case that
jumped across the room. Once, when the Foysters were on
holiday, and the house was unoccupied, Dom Richard visited
the Rectory and found a bed overturned.
Dom Richard Whitehouse was particularly interested?in
the appealing ‘ messages,5 mostly addressed to Mrs Foyster
(‘ Marianne5
) and asking for ‘ light,5 ‘ mass,5 ‘ prayers,5 ‘ help,5
‘ rest,5 etc., that appeared on the walls and pieces of paper
dropped about the house. On one occasion he and Mrs Foyster
A S H O W E R OF W I N E - B O T T L E S 3 7
were examining the walls for ‘ messages/ One particular piece
of wall was blank. Returning two minutes later, Dom Richard
found that during those two minutes a message had appeared
on the patch previously blank. It read: ‘ Get-light-mass-and-
prayers.9 Mrs Foyster and the priest then knelt down and,
addressing the Holy Trinity, asked where, if the message were
genuine, the Mass was to be offered. A few minutes later, on
again passing the spot, they found that the word ‘ here9 had
been added to the message. (See p. 197.)
Dom Richard stated that he was often a witness of the door­
locking phenomenon— sometimes several doors locked (and
unlocked) simultaneously, and the keys disappeared and re­
appeared with perplexing rapidity. Many times Dom Richard
has watched the bells ringing when every member of the house­
hold was beside him.
B o t t l e P h e n o m e n a E x t r a o r d in a r y
The most astonishing phenomena he witnessed on Friday,
November 13, 1931. M r Foyster was in London and was not
due back until late in the evening. He had asked Dom Richard
to stay at the Rectory until his return. While awaiting the
Rector, Dom Richard and Mrs Foyster and a young maid (the
only domestic kept) had a meal in the kitchen. The two infants
had been put to bed. Suddenly a wine-bottle, from nowhere,
burst into fragments under Mrs Foyster’s chair. Fifteen minutes
later a similar bottle smashed under Dom Richard9
s chair. The
maid was kept busy sweeping up the broken glass. Shortly after,
as the three of them were standing with their backs to the fire,
no one moving, they all saw another bottle materialize in the air
above them. First, it was of mushroom shape, then its form
changed to that of a bottle. It hovered in the air for a few seconds
and crashed to the floor at their feet. Then they heard what
they took to be something slowly stamping down the back stairs
that led directly into the kitchen. The door was slightly ajar,
and, as they watched the door, still another bottle rolled into the
kitchen, circled round the room, and stopped— this time without
breaking. The astonished onlookers at once searched the upper
38 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
rooms, passages, attics, but found nothing unusual. Actually, the
bottles came from the cellars.
During the bottle disturbances the bells in the passage were
ringing, and even the large bell in the yard (see Plate X X ) rang
out sharply. Except for some china and other objects thrown
about the kitchen, the rest of the evening was fairly quiet.
I LEASE THE RECTORY
When the Foysters vacated the Rectory in October 1935
Queen Anne’s Bounty decided to sell the house. ‘ Never again,’
they said, ‘ shall a Borley incumbent live in the place.’ I was
not aware of this fact until early in 1937, and was patiently
waiting for the next Rector to take up his abode. It was on
March 13, 1936, that the Rev. A . C. Henning was inducted to
the combined livings of Borley and Liston. And it was he who
informed me that the Rectory could be leased by a layman. I
was overjoyed, and promptly took it for a year.
I had a particular object in view when I rented the Rectory.
I wanted to introduce to the place a fresh set of people: people
who had never heard of Borley; people who were sceptical,
cultured, and educated— preferably of the academic type. I
wanted to eliminate from active participation in the case all
those— including myself— who had had any contact with the
Rectory or its occupants. I wanted to make a fresh start, as it
were, with a fresh set of minds, in order to see whether the
phenomena would persist under the new scientific conditions
that I determined to impose. So I advertised in The Times
(M ay 25, 1937) for the ‘ right’ people. I gave some particulars
of what I wanted, but did not mention myself or the name of the
‘ haunted’ house. M y tenancy began on M ay 19, 1937.
I had many scores of answers to my advertisement in The
Times, and had some difficulty in choosing my collaborators.
However, I selected about forty men who came up to my stan­
dard: university graduates, doctors of medicine, engineers,
scientists, etc.— all with a scientific interest in my investigation,
and all willing to devote their time, money, and skill in an
attempt to solve the ‘ Great Borley Mystery.’ Every member of
A G U I D E T O T H E G H O S T S 3 9
the new group was a stranger to me, though some months later
a few friends (Dr G. E. M . Joad, B.B.G. officials, etc.) spent
observational periods at the house.
M y O f f ic ia l O b se r v e r s
M y idea was that the house should be kept under surveillance
night and day, inside and out, during the whole of my tenancy.
So I formed a rota of observers who, working in couples (usually),
took it in turns to visit the Rectory. I fitted up a comfortable
Base Room (the old study— see Plan II) for them, with a camp-
bed, crockery, lighting and heating, books, some furniture, etc.—
modest amenities that were the best we could do, as, of course,
the Rectory was then unfurnished. I also issued a specially
printed vade mecum, a booklet prepared solely for anyone investi­
gating Borley Rectory— surely the first guide to a particular
haunted house ever written! Observers were told where they
could get meals; what to take with them when visiting the house;
how to make out their reports; how to investigate5; how to
control the house and seal windows, doors, etc. ; what to do if a
ghost is seen and how to address it, etc.1
I cannot, of course, relate here all the strange things that the
official observers saw and heard; for this my previous mono­
graph must be consulted. But I will say at once that most of the
major phenomena were experienced under scientific conditions.
The nun was seen again; many footsteps and similar sounds were
heard; raps, taps, and knockings were frequent; there were many
paranormal movements of objects, and appearances, disappear­
ances, and reappearances of strange articles; a luminous pheno­
menon; pleasant and unpleasant odours; sensation of coldness;
tactual phenomena; etc., etc.
There were other phenomena, some very striking. For
example, a woman’s blue coat, old, dirty, torn, and mouldy,
suddenly ‘ appeared5 in one o f the rooms. W e could never find
where it came from. Then it disappeared for a time— and sud­
denly returned. During a séance held by the Rev. A . G.
Henning and M r Mark Kerr-Pearse, one of the British pro-
1A reprint of the booklet forms Appendix B of The Most Haunted House in England.
4 0 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
consuls at Geneva, ‘ extraordinary noises were heard coming
from the kitchen.’ On another occasion Kerr-Pearse was alone
in the Rectory and was having his evening meal in the Base
Room with the door closed. He heard the key in the lock turn.
Something had locked him in. The extraordinary thing was
that the key was on the inside of the door. Consequently, what­
ever locked him in remained in the room.
Another striking phenomenon was that a fifty-pound bag of
coal was moved paranormally, under control conditions, for a
distance of eighteen inches. Many scribbles and marks appeared
on the walls. On July 28, 1937, Dr C. E. M . Joad saw pencil
markings on a wall, which were not there just previously. On
M ay 7, 1938, M r M . Savage, a B.B.C. television engineer, and a
friend named Bowden, reported new pencillings (see p. 217)
which ‘ appeared’ while they actually watched the walls.
For the hundreds of other phenomena recorded by my obser­
vers, the original reports must be consulted. All of these reports
are, of course, first-hand, and are signed and witnessed by dis­
interested— and usually sceptical— people who were complete
strangers to me and to Borley when they joined our rota of
observers.
I VACATE THE RECTORY
M y year’s tenancy was drawing to a close, and I would have
renewed the lease except for the fact that Queen Anne’s Bounty
was trying desperately to sell the property. So on M ay 9, 1938,
I ‘ moved out.’ That is, I collected all my belongings from the
Base Room and handed back the keys to M r Henning.
A curious incident happened on this my last visit as tenant of
the Rectory. A friend of mine, M r Geoffrey H . Motion, hap­
pened to have a very large car, and he and I went to pick up
my property at the Rectory. We searched the place from top
to bottom several times in order to see whether anything had
been left behind. We gave special attention to the floors, and we
must have searched the Blue Room (No. 6) half a dozen times.
At midnight we made our last inspection, and, as we entered the
room with a powerful lamp and a torch, the first thing we saw
was something shining on the floor. Motion ran and picked it up.
T H E R E C T O R Y G O E S U P I N F L A M E S 41
It was a nearly new (though made in 1864) woman’s twenty-two-
carat gold wedding-ring. We made many inquiries concerning
the ring, but have never found the owner to this day. As a tail­
piece to this story I should mention that M r Foyster records in
his diary, under date March 10, 1931 (that is, nearly seven years
previously): ‘ A wedding-ring was discovered in the bathroom.’
Next morning it disappeared. W e have no means of checking
whether the two rings were, in fact, one and the same.
Apparently little happened at the Rectory during the next
few months; or if there were phenomena we never heard of
them— with two exceptions. A clergyman friend of the Bull
family happened to be passing the Rectory in the autumn of
1938 when he heard ‘ an awful noise as though a lot of furniture
was being thrown about.’ He reported the incident to Miss
Ethel Bull. The Rectory was then unfurnished and unoccupied.
The second phenomenon was noted in November 1938.
Group-Captain Carter Jonas and Flight-Lieutenant Caunter
were two of our observers during the official investigation,
and, happening to be on leave, visited the Rectory one evening.
It was, of course, still unoccupied. They told no one they were
going. Nothing very startling happened, except that both
reported ‘ an overpowering smell of incense’ in one of the rooms.
The next news of Borley I heard through my radio talk. On
November i, 1938, 1 broadcast an account of my twelve months’
investigation of the Rectory phenomena.1 Among the many
letters that I received from listeners was one from a Captain
W . H . Gregson, R .E ., who informed me that he had bought the
Rectory, which had been renamed ‘ The Priory.’ He said he
intended to take up residence there in a few weeks’ time. He
asked me whether I could tell him anything about the rumours
concerning it. We had some correspondence about the place.
T h e R e c t o r y b u r n t o u t
I heard no more about Borley until the News Editors of,
respectively, the. Daily Telegraph and the Evening Standard rang
I I also broadcast a preliminary account o f our investigation in November 1937*
See my article *A Really Haunted House,’ The Listener, November 10, 1937*
42 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
me up on the afternoon of February 28, 1939, to say that the
Rectory had been destroyed by fire at midnight the previous
day. Did I know anything about it? I did not; and I at once
wrote to Captain Gregson for particulars.
In a long letter the Captain told me all about his trouble. It
appeared that on the night of February 27, 1939, Gregson had
been sorting out books in the large hall. A stack of them sud­
denly fell, though apparently firmly placed, and knocked over a
paraffin lamp which flooded the place with oil and ignited.
Captain Gregson, realizing he could do nothing single-handed,
ran to the nearest telephone and rang up the Sudbury fire
brigade. By the time they arrived the place was well alight.
However, the fire was extinguished eventually, but the whole
of the upper storey and attics were burned out and all the
lower rooms were damaged. In fact, the place was gutted.
Captain Gregson was not actually living in the house, but was
staying in the cottage once occupied by Cooper. It will be
remembered that— eleven months previously— a Planchette
‘ entity5 threatened to bum down the Rectory.1 (The exact
wording of the threat is given at p. 119.)
In his letter Gregson spoke of the strange things that had
happened at his new home during his few weeks’ occupation.
There was a shallow well-tank in the cellar (see p. 237), and in
order that his two young sons should not fall in it, he placed a
heavy wooden hatch-cover over the mouth of the well. But the
morning after he placed it in position it was found some distance
frôm the well-mouth. Something had pitched it off. Every door
had been locked the previous night, and entry— normal entry—
was impossible. The wells in the cellar were, later, to play a
major rôle in the Borley drama.
1 The Rev. G. Eric Smith told me of a strange incident connected with the fire.
In a letter fromSevington Rectory, Ashford, Kent, dated May g, 1939, he says:
‘By the way, while on the topic of Borley, I want to tell you of the strangest coinci­
dence. On February 27 [the night Borley Rectory was gutted by fire] we knew
nothing of what was happening at Borley, but we very nearly had a conflagration
in this house: lighted coals fell on the floor, and we remarked what a curious thing:
the house might have been set on fire. D o you think a presence came this way while
Borley was going up in flames? Really, Mrs Smith and I have never known such
happenings before.’
43
F I R E P R O O F G H O S T S
T h e T e r r if ie d S p a n ie l s
Captain Gregson spoke of other strange phenomena that he
and his two boys had seen or heard. The Captain had a black
cocker spaniel. One night he was taking the dog across the
courtyard when he (the Captain) heard footsteps at the far end
of the yard. The steps passed over a wooden trap-door, making
a considerable noise. Gregson paused, and the dog stopped dead
‘ and positively went mad. He shrieked and tore away, still
shrieking, and we have not seen or heard ofhim since. I searched
the yard, but no one was there.’ He purchased another spaniel
puppy. One night he was taking it across the courtyard when
the dog behaved exactly as its predecessor had done. It bolted,
shrieking, and was never seen again.
This same courtyard was the scene of another strange incident.
At four o’clock in the morning after the fire the local policeman
asked Gregson who were the ‘ lady and gentleman, in cloaks,’
whom he had seen coming out of the Rectory during the fire.
The Captain told him that there was no one on the premises
except himself. But the constable was certain he had seen the
two ‘ strangers’ leave the burning building and cross the court­
yard. When I visited the Rectory later in order to take some
photographs1 of the blackened ruins some villagers told me that
two figures were seen at the upper windows when the Rectory
was actually blazing. One appeared to be a young girl, the
other was merely a ‘ formless figure.’
T h e G hosts s u r v iv e t h e F ir e
The fire did not, apparently, destroy the ghosts, and some of
the most remarkable evidence for the haunting of Borley Rectory
concerns a figure seen in the ruins a month after the place was
destroyed. Miss Rosemary M . Williams, of Borley Lodge, and
Mr C. G. Browne, of Pound Hall, Long Melford, were, with
some friends, examining the Rectory by moonlight on the night
of Sunday, March 26, 1939.
Miss Williams and her friend were standing on the Nun’s
Walk gazing at the blackened Rectory when both saw ‘ a small
1Reproduced as Plate V II in The M ost Haunted House in England.
4 4 T H E e n d o f b o r l e y r e c t o r y
woman in the upstairs room, which you term the Blue Room.’
(I am quoting her report.) ‘ I had the impression of some one
in a light buff-coloured coat, but as the figure approached the
window, I could see it was a woman clothed in blue. She re­
mained for several seconds and then turned towards the wall and,
as it seemed, walked through it.5 M r Browne confirmed Miss
Williams’s statement.
As a matter of fact, the floor of the Blue Room had dis­
appeared, and if any girl, incarnate or discarnate, was at the
Blue Room window she must have been standing on nothing,
except, perhaps, some charred and rotten rafters. And no human
being could have climbed up to the window under the existing
conditions. The whole of the upper portion of what was left of
the Rectory was in a very unsafe condition, and Captain Gregson
put up ‘ Keep O ut5notices warning people that they entered the
building at their peril. Most of the upper walls, gables, tower,
veranda roof, etc., did eventually collapse, helped by the wind.
I visited the Rectory once more during 1939 (June 21), on
the occasion of a ‘ psychic fête5 held in the grounds for the pur­
pose of replenishing the funds of Borley Church.1 I wondered,
as I stood by Henry Bull’s strange summer-house, in the shadow
of a large cedar of Lebanon, whether my observers would ever
again keep their nightly vigil on the Nun’s Walk or perambulate,
in couples, the rooms and passages— or what was left of them—
of the desolate-looking Rectory. I thought not. But I was wrong
in thinking that I should never again set foot in ‘ the most
haunted house in England.5 Though I was unaware of it at the
time, my interest in the Rectory and its phenomena was destined
to be sustained for at least another six years.
Well, I have done my best to epitomize the chief contents of
The Most Haunted House in England. But I have really only
scratched the surface of the almost incredible story of Borley
Rectory. The Oxford English Dictionary9
s definition o fÉ
incredible5
is ‘ impossible to be believed.5 But we must believe it. How can
we not believe the dispassionate testimony of two hundred witnesses
1See The Times, June 2 2 , 1939, for account.
ALL A QUESTION OF EVIDENCE 45
(to say nothing of the two spaniels) who have seen and heard
the wonders I have described? Witnesses who are intelligent,
educated, sceptical, and disinterested? Every person who has
resided in the Rectory since it was built in 1863, and practically
every person who has taken the trouble to investigate the alleged
‘ miracles’ for himself, has sworn to incidents that can only be
described as paranormal. It is all a question of evidence, and I
am reminded o f Nathaniel Hawthorne’s remarks concerning the
phenomena he witnessed through the mediumship of D. D .
Home: ‘ These marvels. . . throw old ghost-stories quite into the
shade; they are absolutely proved to be sober facts by evidence
that would satisfy us o f any other alleged realities.’1 Sir Ernest
Jelf and Sir Albion Richardson, K.G., G.B.E., discuss this
question in great detail in a later chapter. (See pp. 321-325.)
Though I have given a recital of the principal phenomena
recorded at Borley, I reiterate that in the original monograph
these phenomena are carefully criticized, analysed, and dis­
cussed, and the controlling conditions under which the mani­
festations were witnessed are described in detail. It is these
minutiae that make the evidence so impressive. In addition, the
volume contains a complete list o f observers, with signed state­
ments; minute-by-minute protocols of observational periods;
accounts o f many o f the experiments carried out; verbatim
séance records; and a chronological list o f events.
It only remains for me to add that the following chapters o f
this volume form the sequel to, or continuation of, The Most
Haunted House in England, with new evidence for the haunting o f
Borley Rectory; a record of recent discoveries; fresh opinions,
observations, and interpretations; and much new material not
included in my first monograph.

CHAPTER II
PRIESTS VERSUS POLTERGEISTS: SOME ATTEMPTS
AT EXORCISM
H
A V IN G heard the story o f Borley, the reader would be
wrong in assuming that this rectory is unique as regards
the Poltergeist phenomena witnessed there. There are many
alleged Poltergeist-infested rectories, and a whole volume could
be written about them. Offhand, I can think o f several. The
classic case, is, o f course, that o f Epworth Parsonage, Lincolnshire
(December and January, 1716- 17), the home of the Wesley
family. Other well-authenticated cases are those o f Hamstall
Ridware (Staffordshire), Watton Priory (Yorks), Patrington
(Yorks), Radley (Berkshire), Sydersterne (Norfolk), Ludlow
(Salop), Askerwell (Dorchester), Leadenham (Lincolnshire),
Asfordby (Leicestershire), Barnack (Northamptonshire), where
Charles Kingsley spent his boyhood, and many more. All are
dealt with in my Poltergeist over England,1 with many other
examples.
Borley Rectory is unique because (a) the manifestations per­
sisted for so many years; (b) because o f the variety and violence
of the phenomena; (c) because a cultured and educated observer,
the Rev. L. A. Foyster, meticulously recorded every paranormal
incident that came under his notice; and (d) because of the great
number of people who have witnessed phenomena there.
The Foysters— and there are a number of them— have a
pleasant custom o f circulating a monthly news-letter among
themselves, a letter that keeps the family informed o f what is
happening to its various members. M r L. A. Foyster prepared
one dealing with some of the phenomena that were disturbing
his household, and kindly sent me a copy. He also sent me a
copy of his diary, in which every untoward event was accurately
chronicled, and allowed me to peruse the manuscript of his
1 Pp- 3°3_320-
T W O T H O U S A N D P H E N O M E N A 4 7
exciting Fifteen Months in a Haunted House, a record, in narrative
form, of what took place at Borley during the worst period of
the 'infestation.9 This book will, I hope, be published in
due course, and should prove a best-seller. It is from the
three documents cited that I have extracted the following
amazing incidents. M r Foyster has neither exaggerated nor
dramatized his adventures. In fact, as he remarks in a letter
(dated September 16, 1937) to M r S. J. Glanville, in mentioning
his manuscript, ' I have kept to the actual facts of the haunt­
ing with possibly even over-scrupulous exactness.5 From Mr
Foyster’s records and from my own observation and inquiries,
I have estimated that at least two thousand Poltergeist pheno­
mena were experienced at the Rectory between October 1930
and October 1935, the period of his residence there. It must
always be borne in mind that in every haunted house manifesta­
tions are much more frequent, and usually more spectacular,
when a family is in residence. Ghosts like company. And this
applies especially to Poltergeists. And, of course, when a person
is actually living in such a house, he is in a much better position
to record the phenomena than an observer who merely visits
the place occasionally. It can be said, too, that the fact of Mrs
Foyster being 'psychic,5 or coming from a psychic family, pro­
bably induced more phenomena. However, it is only a question
of degree, as so many observers have recorded, over a period of
many years, incidents identical with those that so worried the
Rector and his wife.
As we have seen, on the very day they moved into the Rectory
Mr Foyster, his wife, and little Adelaide heard strange footsteps
about the house and a voice calling 'Marianne, dear.5 A few
nights later the Rector heard more footsteps, which he took to
be those of his wife. He searched the place, and found that Mrs
Foyster was out. A few days later a workman in the house
inquired for the Rector, 'as he heard him come downstairs.9
But this time it was the Rector who was out. These strange
footsteps became a feature of the haunting, and the household
got used to them. It was at this period that 'Harry Bull5began
to be seen about the house— usually on the staircase— by Mrs
48 T H E E N D OF B 0 R L E Y R E C T O R Y
Foyster, who, as I have said, comes from a psychic family. The
phantasm was, I think, a subjective one, as no one else saw it.
He was always attired in a dressing-gown of a peculiar colour,
and never in clerical garb. And he was usually carrying a roll
of paper or scroll.
Then came the ‘ odours.’ Sometimes a perfume resembling
lavender would permeate the house and especially the Foysters’
bedroom. Occasionally a smell of cooking— when no meals were
being prepared— would float through their bedroom window
between 11 p.m. and midnight— a strange hour! Then crockery
began to disappear from the kitchen and just as mysteriously
reappear. Were the utensils used for the ‘ cooking1? Unfortu­
nately, some of the things ‘ transported’ did not return. Mrs
Foyster had a watch-bracelet. One day, during her ablutions
in the bathroom, she removed her watch and put it down beside
her. When she had finished washing she found to her amaze­
ment that the bracelet portion had been detached from the
watch and was missing. It has never been seen since.
Sometimes the Poltergeists were helpful. Occasionally, when
a thing was missing, and every one was hunting high and low
for it, it would suddenly ‘ appear’ in a place where one almost
fell over it. One day Mrs Foyster had lost something and was
searching everywhere. As she passed along a passage a door
slowly opened. She went to close it, and there, just inside the
room, was the missing article.
Very suddenly the wraith of the supposed ‘ Harry Bull’ ceased
troubling them. It was seen no more. Also suddenly, the house
became very quiet and tranquil— no strange noises, no para­
normal footsteps, nothing missing. The Foysters thought that
peace had descended upon their home. But it was merely a lull.
One day the Rector noticed a book lying on the window-sill
of the lavatory. He imagined his wife had left it there. Mrs
Foyster also saw it, and thought the Rector had placed it on the
sill. Neither disturbed it for some days, until M r Foyster, think­
ing it looked rather out of place, removed it to the library. The
next day another appeared. Then his wife complained about his
untidiness, and it was revealed that neither had placed a book
M R S F O Y S T E R R E C E I V E S A B L A C K E V E 49
there. It was taken away. But as soon as one book was removed
another appeared in the same place, and this sort of thing went
on for some days. Then the Poltergeists tired of the joke. I will
add in parentheses that the Foysters did not keep a maid at this
period. Just before the book incident a bag of lavender suddenly
appeared on the mantelpiece of one of the rooms. No one knew
where it came from. It just as suddenly disappeared. A few
mornings later the Rector found it in his coat-pocket when he
was dressing.
Then jugs began to disappear, together with a teapot. Mrs
Foyster, addressing the ‘ entities,’ asked that they should be re­
stored to her. That afternoon she went into the kitchen, and
there were the jugs, all in a heap, on the kitchen table. A plate,
too, had been returned— and this was not asked for! And the
teapot was still missing. She again ‘ asked’ for that, and it duly
reappeared on the same evening. Then Mrs Foyster thought of
her bracelet and audibly requested its return. This time she was
unlucky.
As if to celebrate the return of the crockery, all the bells began
to ring. The wires of most of these had been cut, but this fact
did not disconcert whatever was ringing them. The bells also
heralded a spate ofphenomena, mostly connected with the books.
A pile of hymn-books was found on the rack ofthe kitchen range,
the place where normally plates are heated. Curiously, no one
knew where these Durham Mission hymn-books came from.
Still more curiously, the church happened to he very short of
hymn-books, so they came in useful. Poltergeists can be very
helpful— sometimes. However, the ‘ gift’ was marred somewhat
by the fact that the Foysters’ teapot again disappeared.
That same evening, as Mrs Foyster was walking along the
passage outside the bathroom, she was struck a terrific blow
under the eye, the resultant cut bleeding copiously. Though she
was carrying a candle, she did not see what struck her. Her eye
was black for some days. The next night, just as the Foysters had
retired to rest, things started flying about the bedroom. A large
cotton-reel that had stood on the mantelpiece was projected
across the room; it struck the wall and fell on their bed. Then
D
50 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
they felt something whizz by their heads and fall with a clatter
to the floor. The Rector lit the lamp and explored. The missile
was a hammer-head with a portion of the broken handle still in
situ. The hammer had, apparently, come from the same cupboard
in the study in which Mrs Smith had previously found the skull.
After some minor inconveniences— such as pins, with points
upward, being found in the chairs the Foysters usually sat on—
the ‘ entities’ began to show signs of ill-temper. A favourite trick
was to place things in passages and dark corners, where people
would be likely to fall over them. An old saucepan and part ofa
lamp, the one resting on the other, were found outside the door
of the Rector’s study— and he nearly fell over them. The articles
did not belong to the house. Then the long handle of a floor-
polisher was found across one of the doorways, and the Rector
walked into that. Then Mrs Foyster tripped over a tin of bath-
salts that had been placed just inside the bathroom door. Then
all was quiet for a few days— except, perhaps, for a little inter­
mittent bell-ringing.
On the night of March 5, 1931, the Rector was roused from his
sleep by being hit on the head with his own hair-brush. Next day
a door-knob was thrown, with some violence, at Mrs Foyster.
The reader can imagine the state of mind of the Rector and
his wife at these disturbances. He decided to seek relief and
visited a clerical friend, the rector of a neighbouring parish.
This gentleman was very sympathetic and suggested exorcizing
the Rectory ghosts. For this purpose he gave M r Foyster some
holy water from the well of Our Lady of Walsingham and a form
of service to use with it. When the Rector returned home he
found that his wife had again been hurt. She had been injured
in the neck by a missile that had been thrown at her.
However, she was well enough to assist her husband in the
ritual of exorcism, and held the lamp while he went through the
various rooms, sprinkling holy water and reciting the prayers.
The Poltergeists wert furious \ In the middle of the ceremony
a stone, the size of a man’s fist, was hurled at them and hit the
Rector on the shoulder. But they persevered with the exorcism
and finally completed the ritual. Then M r Foyster went to
a ‘ d e s p e r a t e d a y ’
51
obtain assistance for his wife, who had not been well and, q ^
naturally, was suffering from the effects of the ‘ m a n ife st
tions.’
When the Rector returned his wife told him a strange sto
During his absence she heard a great commotion somewhere i ’
the house. Leaving Mrs Foyster in the kitchen, the Rector ^
plored the rooms. In his wife’s private sitting-room he fOUt^
that a number of her books had been pulled off the shelves, atlcj
that every picture in the hall, and those on the staircase, had
been thrown down and scattered all over the floor. That satne
night, as they lay in bed, things were thrown about their r o o ^
That was on a Saturday.
It is only fair to the Poltergeists to say that, usually, they ief(.
the Rectory’s inmates in peace on Sundays, and the same cap
be said of all Holy Days, and the various festivals connected with
the Church. So on Sunday, March 8, 1931, the Foysters had
some quietness of mind and body.
But the ‘ entities’ made up for it on Monday! Mr Foyster C
alls
it a ‘ desperate day.’ It was extremely cold, and the plumber>
s
men were engaged in thawing out the pipes. Neither the cold
nor the workmen prevented the Poltergeists from ‘ demonstrate
j^g 5 Time after time ‘ strange, heavy objects kept appearin»
outside the kitchen door. No one knew what they were, or where
they came from. During the afternoon the kindly Rector fr0m
the neighbouring parish (the one who had supplied the holy
water) paid the Foysters a visit. He saw a stone come r o lW
down the back stairs, and all the bells gave a merry peal.
perhaps a peal of defiance. The visiting rector said he would call
again on the following Wednesday, with incense and holy wateq
and hold another service, with exorcism.

A log of wood rolled along the passage.
A stone was thrown at Mrs Foyster.
52 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
A heavy piece of iron was thrown at Mrs Foyster, who
actually saw the object being ‘ carried’ along, but saw
nothing that was carrying it.
A stone was thrown at the Rector.
And Mrs Foyster found a small pile of stones under her
pillow when she awoke the next morning. The Rector
did not get to sleep until 3 a .m .
Tuesday was fairly quiet, except that a stone was thrown (from
inside the house) at a large window in the hall, completely smash­
ing it; and at night Mrs Foyster stumbled over a brick that had
been placed outside the bathroom door. The next morning Mr
Foyster found a couple of pebbles under his pillow.
True to his promise, the sympathetic rector from the neigh­
bouring parish arrived on the next morning (Wednesday) and
brought a clerical friend with him. The three parsons incensed
and sprinkled and blessed the house from top to bottom, from
attics to cellars, and the job was done thoroughly. There were
no demonstrations— not until later in the day, when there was
some stone-throwing and sporadic bell-ringing. Another clergy­
man (making the fourth that day) visited the house in the even­
ing, and there was more stone-throwing and a ‘ regular peal of
bells.’ Thursday was ‘ quiet,’ except that a lot of clean linen
was removed from the kitchen cupboard, and trailed across the
floor. The incense, holy water, prayers, exorcism, and the pres­
ence of four clericals in the house on one day did not, apparently,
produce very good results.1
1The question has often been raised as to whether Anglican and Roman Catholic
priests are perm itted to exorcize without express sanction from their superiors. In
L itu rg y and W orship, edited by W . K. Lowther Clarke, D.D. (London, 1932, p. 480),
the matter is discussed: ‘With regard to the West, exorcism is still a part of the
ministry—in theory at least—both of the Roman and of the Anglican priest. But at
present, in most Roman dioceses, the parish priest is required to obtain his Bishop’s
licence, before he can use the dramatic R ita s exorcizandi obsessos a dcsmonio provided
in the R ituale. . . . R.C. Bishops (also priests, if they are granted a licence) are per­
mitted to exorcize not only the faithful, but also non-Catholics and the excommuni­
cate (Can. 1152). In the Church of England the position is somewhat similar.
Canon 7
2o f a.d. 1604forbids the parish priest w ithout episcopal licence “ by fasting and
* prayer to cast out any devil or devils,” under pain of deposition from the ministry.
This Canon was passed to put an end to the scandals caused by public competitions
in exorcism between rival divines. Some authorities have held that, the language
of the Canon being unqualified, not only public exhibitions of the kind indicated are
forbidden (except under licence), but even the private use of exorcism in ordinary
pastoral ministrations.’
E X O R C I S M S S E L D O M E F F E C T I V E 53
Parenthetically, I will say a few words about exorcisms. They
are very seldom effective, or, if so, only temporarily. They seem
to annoy the ‘ entities.’ In my Poltergeist over England I have cited
many cases where priests, Anglican and Roman Catholic, have
exorcized— or attempted to exorcize— the disturbing ‘ spirits.’
Practically all were failures, with one outstanding exception. A
Miss Ada M . Sharpe occupied a house, ‘ Beth-oni,’ at Tackley,
Oxfordshire. Between 1905 and 1908 her home was infested
with a Poltergeist that made her life miserable. For three years
‘ cannon-bursts,’ bangs, bumps, flashes of light, hammerings on
the roof, footsteps all over the building, apparitions, the flight of
bed-clothes during sleep, etc., nearly drove her out of the house.
She decided to call in a priest. So on July 12, 1907, the Rev.
L. de Clare exorcized the building with prayers, incense, and
holy water. The atmosphere of the house immediately changed,
and all was quiet— until the following January. Then Miss
Sharpe ‘ heard a dog walking round her bed.’ Later, she could
not close her bedroom door because something on the other side
was pushing against it. Then she found a ‘ form’ huddled up in
her bed. She decided to call in another priest. This was the
Rev. J. C. Fitzgerald, of the Mirfield Community, who again
exorcized the ‘ entities, ’ with the usualtechnique. The phenomena
stopped immediately, and, writing five years later,1 Miss Sharpe
tells us that there were no further disturbances.
It is not generally known that the prayers of the Church con­
tain a petition against the Poltergeist or Spirituspercutiens, the spirit
that produces ‘ percussive noises.’ It is this prayer, I suspect,
that the priests used at ‘Beth-oni.’2 It is doubtful if this particu­
lar exorcism was known to M r Foyster and his friends. The
Rector himself pinned his faith to creosote, which he burned in
the ‘ disturbed’ parts of the house. He claims that they enjoyed
some temporary relief through this means. Another method was
burning lavender— used, I am afraid, with little success.
But to return to Borley Rectory. On Friday, March 13, 1931,
1In a very rare privately printed pamphlet, A DisturbedHouse andits Relief (Oxford,
1914),
2Or perhaps they recited the Visita qucesumus, a prayer for the divine protection of
a house and its occupants.
5 4 T H E e n d o f b o r l e y r e c t o r y
while the Foysters were having their evening meal, a piece of
brick dropped on to the table near the Rector’s plate. During a
meal on a previous night a potsherd struck Mrs Foyster on the
head and made it bleed.
On the following Sunday (March 15) Mrs Foyster found the
kitchen table upside down with its legs pointing heavenward;
and the contents of the store cupboard were scattered all over the
place, both in the kitchen and contiguous passages. As I have
remarked, it was unusual for serious disturbances to occur on the
Sabbath.
It was about this period that ‘ horrible odours’ were noticed in
the Rector’s study— and nowhere else— and more stone-throwing
was recorded. M r Foyster was hit several times, though not hurt,
but his wife was injured four times— but never when wearing her
scapular.1 When she neglected to put it on she was struck.
During these months of torment M r Foyster came to the con­
clusion that there were two distinct bands o f‘ entities’ or Polter­
geists at work in the Rectory. One group was cruel, noisy,
erratic, thievish, demonstrative, cunning, and spiteful; the other
set appeared to be more friendly towards the incarnate occupants
of the house. Apparently the ‘ bad’ spirits stole the Foysters’
property, while the ‘ good’ ones returned it and presented
them with a number of things that did not belong to the Foysters.
For example, a most useful tin trunk suddenly ‘ appeared’ in the
kitchen. Its history was quite unknown. A very nice powder-
bowl was ‘ apported’ to the bathroom (just before Christmas—-a
seasonable gesture!), and an expensive gold wedding-ring was
discovered in the same place. This, alas, disappeared after a
few hours. I have already recorded that Motion and I found a
similar ring (perhaps the same ring) in the Blue Room seven
years later.
Other things that the Poltergeists deposited in various parts
of the house were scraps of paper— many of them bearing
‘ messages,’ both cryptic and pathetic. They were written in a
‘ rather shaky, childish hand.’ They were usually addressed to
‘ Marianne,’ the Rector’s wife. On one of these Mrs Foyster
1Part o f the habit of certain religious orders in the Roman Catholic Church.
P A R A N O R M A L D O O R - L O C K I N G 55
wrote ‘ W hat do you want? ’ and left the paper in a prominent
position. Next day there appeared on the same paper the word
‘ Rest’ (see Plate X X V I), though Mrs Foyster declared it was
‘ Pest’ ! It could be taken for either. Most of these messages
were in the nature of a cri de cœur. On one appeared the direct
appeal: ‘ Marianne help me.’ Underneath Mrs Foyster wrote
‘ How? ’ But no answer was forthcoming. Similar messages were
found scribbled on the walls. One of these, as the reader will
learn, played a major part in the Borley drama.
Among the various strange manifestations witnessed by the
Foysters and others (including DomRichard Whitehouse, O .S.B .,
M r Mark Kerr-Pearse, and myself) were the door-locking (or
unlocking) phenomena. The keys of most of the doors dis­
appeared during the incumbency of the Rev. G. Eric Smith.
Some of these returned as mysteriously as they vanished. When
the Foysters took up their residence at the Rectory in October
1930 there was hardly a key in the house. However, that fact
did not prevent the doors from being locked— paranormally.
The doors became locked at the most inopportune moments:
just as the Foysters were about to retire for the night and tried
to enter their bedroom; when they were due to receive visitors,
and the front door refused to open; when the Rector wished to
work in his study; and so on.
I have already recorded how I took part in an ‘ unlocking’
ceremony on October 13, 1931, when Mrs Foyster was locked
in her bedroom. On this occasion entry was secured by means
of a relic belonging to the Curé d’Ars. It appears that the Rector
possessed two relics, one connected with St Jean-Baptiste
Vianney, the curé I have mentioned, and another of the history
of which I am ignorant. Not very surprisingly, both of these
relics once ‘ disappeared’ and returned in the usual unorthodox
manner.
I do not know the mechanism by means of which miracles
occur through application of relics. It may be simply faith
which, if it can ‘ move mountains,’ can also unlock a door; or it
may be prayer, or both. Carlyle says that ‘ all miracles have been
wrought by thought,’ and there is a French proverb to the effect
56 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
that ‘ there are no miracles for those who have no faith in them.’
The Foysters had faith, and the miracles happened.
As for Jean-Baptiste Vianney (1786-1859), his own life was
full of miracles— and Poltergeists, which plagued him for thirty-
five years. Loud knocks on his gate, a storm of blows on his
furniture, sounds as of a horse galloping in the hall below his
room, and similar disturbances were frequent. Once, he de­
clared, as he lay in bed, the ‘ devil’ pushed him about the room
all night!1
I do not know the nature of M r Foyster’s ‘ relic.’ I always
associate relics with bones, but I am probably wrong. However,
the Rev. Father Gay, of the Catholic Presbytery, Kelvedon,
Essex, has something to say about both the good curé and his
relics. Father Gay was discussing the Borley case:

were hoaxed (for five years?) and that the alleged phenomena

were due to normal causes. As Joseph Glanvill wrote, ‘ That is
the eternal evasion !51 Again, to quote Glanvill:

But I have an argument much stronger than Glanvill’s: M r
Foyster was but one out o f about two hundred witnesses who vouched
for similar phenomena at Borley. Much of this evidence has
already been published in my The Most Haunted House in England.
For the sake of posterity— especially sceptical posterity— I will
record, in the next chapters, the further testimony for the
haunting of Borley Rectory that I have accumulated since my
first book was published in 1940.

AN EXCITING NIGHT
M Y first new witness is M r G. P. J. L’Estrange, o f‘ Nazareth,’
119 Beccles Road, Bungay, Suffolk. He is interested in
haunted houses, and, since M r Foyster was aware of this fact, he
was invited to visit Borley Rectory with some friends. He publi­
cized his adventures and has kindly sent me an abridged account
ofhis report that appeared in the Norwich Mercury for December 24,
1942. Here it is:
T h e H a u n t e d R e c t o r y
A good many years have passed since my adventure in the ‘most
haunted house in England,’ an account of which I broadcast1some
time ago, but I have so often been asked to repeat the story that I
need offer no apology for relating it here.
As much has been written about that weird house since it was
destroyed by fire, I am revealing no secret when I disclose that it
was Borley Rectory, which stood on the border of Suffolk and
Essex. It was in the early days of 1932 that the Rector, hearing of
my interest in haunted houses, invited me to visit him and give my
opinion of the phenomena. I accepted gladly, for intriguing news
of the uncanny happenings at the Rectory had already been
featured in the London Press, although care was taken to keep the
whereabouts of the house a secret.
I arrived at the Rectory in the early darkness of a January after­
noon,® and was immediately struck by its gloomy appearance. It
was exactly the sort of place one associates with ghosts. A large
mansion (it was once the residence, I believe, of a well-known
titled family3). It had barred windows set in its red-brick walls,
and a pinnacled tower stood over the main doorway. The house
was approached by a gravel drive, bordered with trees and shrubs,
and I remembered that (according to reports) a phantom coach
had been both seen and heard in the grounds at various times.
I was getting out of the car which had brought me from Col­
chester, when I noticed a tall figure standing quite still in the angle

A little later I sat alone before the fire, w hile the R ector attended

The Rev. L. A . Foyster records the visit of M r L ’Estrange and
his companions1in his diary under the dateJanuary 23-24, 1932.
He confirms M r L ’Estrange’s account of the phenomena. He
says: ‘ Great demonstrations! Bottles dashed down back stairs;
kitchen passage was strewn with broken glass, etc. Bells rang.
Quieted down for a time, but racket started again.’
M r L ’Estrange’s companions submitted to the Rector a report
of the night’s doings, and M r Foyster includes it in his Fifteen
Months in a Haunted House. I will paraphrase a few extracts :

1It is extraordinary what a number o f 4Blue Rooms* there are in haunted houses,
and how all the major phenomena are centred there. In addition to Borley, each of
the following houses possesses— or possessed— a ‘ Blue Room *: ‘ Beth-om,* Tackley,
Oxfordshire; Ballechin House, Perthshire; Calvados Castle, Normand y; Jliiiton
Ampner, Hants; and Wiliington Mill, Tyneside. And in a book called the Blue
Room, by Clive Chapman (Dunedin, 1927), is a vivid account of the Poltergeist
phenomena o f Pearl Judd, a New Zealand physical medium. (See my Poltergeist
over England.) In a ghost story, The Fiddler, by Richard Heame, broadcast by tee
B.B.C. on December sa, 1944, all tee phenomena (mostly murders) occurred m tee
‘ Blue Room.*— H. P.
64 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
There is confirmatory evidence for the above amazing happen­
ings. Captain V . M . Deane (‘ The Willows,5 Braiswick, Col­
chester) in an article1 says:
I have cross-examined the principal witnesses for hours on end,
and I have in addition the entire record of the sittings of the Marks
Tey circle for the twelve months of 1932, recorded in shorthand at
the time. There is not the slightest shadow of doubt but that in fall
lamp-light showers of bottles and stones fell amongst batches of
from three to five percipients, who saw the phenomena with their
eyes, heard them with their ears, and handled the apported objects
with their hands; and, though two of the percipients are now dead,
there axe still six alive whose evidence cannot be shaken.
Captain Deane discusses the possible causation of the pheno­
mena, and I will include his remarks in a later chapter.
Mr L5
Estrange concludes his article by stating that from the
night ofJanuary 23-24, 1932, the whole atmosphere of the house
changed and became more or less normal— at least for a long
time. I believe this to be a fact. The manifestations on this
exciting night reached a crescendo of violence never hitherto
attained, and just burnt themselves out.
However, the phenomena did not entirely cease, though I
have no record of any incidents comparable in violence with
those experienced by M r L 5
Estrange and his friends, as having
occurred subsequent to the visit ofthe Marks Tey circle. Whether,
in fact, the presence of the spiritualists did have a beneficial effect,
I do not know. But it is a fact that the house became quieter, the
phenomena less frequent and violent, and the atmosphere of the
place more peaceful. During my lesseeship of the Rectory in
1937-38 my official observers recorded many more types of
manifestations than were experienced by the Foysters, but few
of them were noisy or violent, and none dangerous. It can be
said without fear of contradiction that the Foyster occupation
coincided with the noisiest, most violent, and most dangerous
period in the whole recorded history of the Borley manifesta­
tions. And at no other period did those pathetic messages appear
on the walls, or, inscribed on paper, flutter down from the ceilings.

W H O L I T T H E L A M P ? 65
As I have stated, the phenomena that were recorded after M r
L’Estrange’s visit were few and far between. But they were
interesting nevertheless. During the June following some objects
were thrown (as M r Foyster records in his diary). Later in the
year there was a strange incident with the lamp. Mrs Foyster
happened to be unwell and had gone to bed early. The Rector
had gone into the garden for something, and the maid had taken
the two little children to a party. When M r Foyster returned to
the house it was quite dusk, and he at once went straight to his
wife in order to light the lamp in her room. To his astonishment
the lamp was alight! ‘ “ Did you light it?5
’ I asked in some sur­
prise, not thinking she was well enough to do so. “ N o,” she
replied, “ some one lit it. I don’t know who it was. I woke up
just in time to hear the retreating footsteps.” 5 The Rector was
much mystified as his wife was then alone in the house.
During June 1933 the Rector records: C
I hear strange noises
in the house that I cannot account for, but nothing further
follows.’
'During 1935/ says the Rector, there were some indications of
'a little trouble starting up again.’ A few things disappeared in
unaccountable ways. On August 5 of that year a noise like a
picture falling in the drawing-room was heard. Investigations
revealed that nothing was out of place. M r Foyster concludes
his diary: cThese noises continued at intervals, some appearing
to come from upstairs. Altogether, we heard the bangs thirteen
or fourteen times.’ The Foysters vacated the Rectory in October
I93S-
I think that there is ample evidence to show that during the
latter part of M r Foyster’s incumbency the Poltergeists had not
vanished, but were merely quiescent. It needed only the neces­
sary stimulus for them to become active again. This stimulus
was forthcoming when my official observers began living in the
Rectory during the years 1937-38.

Q O M E two hundred reviews and Press notices of The Most
aunted House in England were published in this and other
countries, and more than one writer quoted the New Testament
p rase- that heads this chapter. Since my book appeared many
more witnesses’ have sent me reports on their recent experiences
a or ey Rectory, even though the house was then merely a
ac ene ruin, and fast disintegrating into a heap of rubble. I
wi now publish some of these reports. I must emphasize that
my correspondents are still strangers to me. I have never met
one of them, with the exception of M r Harry Marshall, of Trinity
o ege, Oxford, whom I have seen once or twice during my
ectures at the University; and the Rector of Borley-cum-Liston,
whom, of course, I know well.

a acce y a Poltergeist, in broad daylight. Poltergeists are
no suppose to attack people, or harm them. But at Borley,
they do— as the reader is aware.

e i ea o t e qualities possessed by M r Russell, who was also
onnec e wit several other cable companies. I need say no

occurred at Woodbridge, Suffolk, only a few m
iles fromBorley.
One day the Rector of Woodbridge, Mr Broom, was w
alking
through the town with a Dutch lieutenant, who was ‘psychic.’
The latter suddenly declared that coming towards them w
as a
ghost, and advised the Rector that they ‘ must give way to it.’
Mr Broomsaid it was all nonsense and refused to move. B
efore
they could argue the matter further both were thrown into th
e
middle of the street, the Rector with a broken knee and th
e
lieutenantwith more serious injuries. Compared with the above
experience, Mr Russell got offlightly!
A P o l is h I n v e s t i g a t i o n
Following an article on Borley Rectory which I wrote for th
e
issue ofEverybody1
s Weekly dated August 7, 1943 (though on sa
le
a week earlier), I received a great many letters about the case.
Someweresenttomedirect; otherswereaddressedtotheeditor,
whoforwardedthemtome. Two ofthelatterwereofthehighest
importance as providing further good evidence for the haunting
ofthe Rectory. One of these letters—from Mr Gilbert Hayes—
I will deal with in the next chapter; the other I will include
here.
On August 1, 1943, Lieutenant G. B. Nawrocki, who is a
doctor of medicine and attached to the Polish Army Medical
Corps, wrote to the editor, asking for my address. The letter
w
as forwarded to me, and I answered it. In his reply (from
45 William Street, Kirkcaldy, Fife) Lieutenant Nawrocki in­
formed me that a few w
eeks previously he and some brother
officers had spent two nights at Borley Rectory, with most in­
teresting results. An almost minute-by-minute protocol of th
eir
visits had been prepared, with tim
es and incidents recorded
scientifically. He enclosed the report (which was written in
perfect English), which he hoped would be of some use to m
e.
He alsomentionedthatheknewmebyrepute, havingreadm
ost
of my books, and had taken an interest in scientific psychical
researchfor many years.
I will now reproduce Lieutenant Nawrocki’s report, w

shall speakfor itself:

In his covering letter (dated August 8, 1943) Lieutenant
Nawrocki says: £I am quite sure that I twice saw the shadow on
the Nun’s Walk, and once a shadow of a man in Room No. 3.’
He asks whether they were the phantasms of the cnun’ and the
Rev. Harry Bull respectively. Personally, I doubt whether the
ghost of Harry Bull has ever been seen at the Rectory. As for
the 'nun,5it is possible that she was 'active5that evening for the
following reason.
Although Lieutenant Nawrocki was not aware of the fact, he
and his friends, on their second visit, were at the Rectory on
the day of the year—July 28—when tradition asserts that the
nun always 'walks.5 Personally, I doubt this, as I have been there
on the date mentioned, and so have my friends, with negative
results. I think the story gained currency because on July 28,
1900, the Misses Ethel, Freda, Mabel, and Elsie Bull saw the nun
collectively on the lawn of their home in what amounted to sun­
light. I think it can be said that the nun is seldom seen on
July 28.
Lieutenant Nawrocki and his friends showed considerable skill
in improvisation when they 'rebuilt5the floor of the Blue Room,
erected seats and a table, etc. In order to examine the upper
floor of the house, they must have laid planks across the rafters
on which to walk. It is very significant that many of the mani­
festations occurred in the Blue Room, where so many phenomena
have been witnessed during the past fifty years. Another place
where incidents were recorded was in the kitchen passage, on the
walls of which many of the 'Marianne5 messages appeared.
And it was in the kitchen passage where many an orgy of bell­
ringing aroused the almost distracted occupants of the Rectory.
Stones have been 'falling5in the kitchen passage for many years.
The Chapel, or oratory, was another focus of psychic activity,
and it is worthy of note that it was on the wall of this apartment
that the shadow of the man was silhouetted.
When Lieutenant Nawrocki speaks of the Blue Room, Room
No. 5, etc., he means, of course, the shells of these rooms. A
glance at the photographs I took after the fire will show that
these rooms were practically roofless. Properly to, appreciate
72 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
Lieutenant Nawrocki’s report, the plans of the house should be
studied.
It is interesting to note that on the morning of July 28, 1943,
Mr Arthur S. Medcraft spent some hours in the Rectory garden,
and experienced no phenomena. On his previous visit, earlier
in the same month, he was dogged by an invisible walker, heard
a door slam in the Rectory, and smelt a strange perfume. His
report is included in the next chapter.
O x f o r d visits B o r l e y
My next report also refers to a visit to the Rectory, and was
sent by Mr Harry Marshall and Mr J. H. Russell, both under­
graduates of Trinity College, Oxford. Marshall is the son of
Mr J. R. Marshall, K.C., D.L., the distinguished Scots jurist.
The two students visited Borley from January 3 to January 6,
1944, though actually they spent only ten hours on the Rectory
premises. This short period was due to the delay in obtaining
the necessary permission to investigate, the ruins having just
previously changed hands. However, a major reason for their
visiting Borley was to obtain photographs of constructional
details of the fabric— or what was left of it— and in this they
were very successful, Mr Marshall securing fifty photographs
(some of which are included in this volume). The fact that,
owing to the fire, etc., daylight had penetrated into the places
(\
e.g., the cellars) formerly in darkness, made photographing
easier. But some pictures were taken by flashlight. Harry
Marshall and his camera were only just in time, as even then
demolition work had begun in a modest way.
The phenomena they experienced were neither spectacular nor
numerous, but one or two incidents were worthy of record. On
the Tuesday morning (January 4), on their first visit, cwe heard
a crash in a cellar below us. We were at least six feet from the
point, over a bit of iron gutter, which we believe was hit by a
bit of brick. We both think that we did not kick anything of a
sufficient size to produce the noise/ Mr Russell, who sent me
an independent report, mentions the incident and remarks: *As
neither of us was directly above, or, in fact, near any of these
T H E V O I C E I N T H E G A R D E N 73
objects at that time, we thought it rather odd, particularly as we
thought we should have noticed kicking a stone of the size which
we found by trial to be necessary to cause the noise/
A more puzzling incident occurred at 5.25 on the afternoon of
January 5. Russell says:
The only incident occurred in the garden at 5.25 p .m., when we
were walking down the orchard away from the house. Marshall
was standing on the cart-track, which runs through the orchard
from the field beyond the garden, when I heard him call to me and
I replied. But he said that he had not spoken. I felt certain at the
time that he had called to me, but when he denied that he had
spoken I naturally began to doubt whether I had heard him at the
time. H e was about fifteen yards in front of me.
Harry Marshall, in his report, confirms the incident:
O n Wednesday evening Russell was certain I called him. I did
not. A t the time (5.25 p .m .) he claimed to have recognized my
voice. When he knew I had not called him he naturally began to
doubt whether he really had heard a voice. He was by the north­
east end of the stream in the garden; I was fifteen yards away on
the path through the orchard from the road to the fields.
It is significant that Mr Russell was standing by the stream
near the Nun’s Walk. In fact, one of the variants of the nun
tradition is that she committed suicide by throwing herself into
this stream. As for 'voices’ heard at Borley, this is a common
phenomenon. The Rev. G. Eric Smith, one of the incumbents,
heard 'sibilant whisperings’ on the landing many times— even
when he was alone in the house. Once he heard a woman’s voice
moaning, 'Don’t, Carlos, don’t !’ Mr Smith’s successor, the Rev.
L. A. Foyster, on the very first day of his residence at the Rectory,
heard a voice calling 'Marianne,’ his wife’s name. Later Mrs
Foyster also heard 'voices’ in the house. So if, in fact, Mr Russell
did hear what he took to be his friend’s voice, the phenomenon
was not unique.
Another incident which might be regarded as paranormal
concerned a bag in which the undergraduates kept their tools
and photographic accessories. When exploring the garden they
74 t h e e n d o f b o r l e y r e c t o r y
put it on a shelf in the summer-house, carefully noting the exact
spot. This was on Tuesday, January 4, 1944. When, some time
later (at 12.25 they went to collect their bag it was no­
where to be seen. After some searching they found it on the
grass behindthe summer-house. As the bag was not being ‘ con­
trolled’ at the time, it is possible that the ‘ transportation’ was
not a paranormal one, and was due to a mischievous ‘ entity,’
incarnate rather than discarnate. Harry Marshall and his friend
recorded other incidents, which they described as ‘ doubtful.’
Once they thought they heard some one in the Rectory; and at
5.42 on the afternoon ofJanuary 5 Mr Marshall records: ‘ Later,
at 5.42, while standing by the summer-house (opposite the Nun’s
Walk), I turned round and thought I saw some one in the corner
of the field. But it is easy to imagine things when turning sud­
denly and when it is beginning to get dark.’ The incident
occurred seventeen minutes after Russell thought he heard Harry
Marshall address him.
Other students who visited Borley include John Cooper, D.
Ackland, J. Dashwood, M. Jacomb, and D. Jones. This party—
from one of our famous public schools—visited the site on the
evening of December 19, 1945. They camped in the summer­
house. In a report which Mr Cooper sent me the following
incident is recorded: in true professional manner, they ‘ ringed’
a number of objects, as a control for possible paranormal move­
ments. Included among these articles was half of a two-inch
brick (the ancient variety, which must have come from the
foundations of the Rectory or the cellar well). This was placed in
the centre of the fixed table that stands in the middle of the
summer-house. Suddenly the brick fell to the ground. No one
touched it. The brick was seen to be lying on the ground, im­
mediately below that portion of the edge of the table, from
which it had fallen. Then suddenly it disappeared, a search
revealing that it had travelled, on the ground, to the other side
of the table. The thick wooden support of the table lay in the
path between the two successive positions the brick had occupied;
Therefore the brick must have made a curvilinear flight round
the support. If the brick had travelled in a straight line it would

have hit the post. The successive positions of the brick were
photographed, and Mr Cooper enclosed a copy with his re­
port.
On January 19, 1946, Mr Peter Jackson, o f 39 Beadon Road,
Bromley, Kent, and his friend Mr L. H. P. Hall visited Borley,
and they too spent the night in the summer-house, there being
no other shelter. A glance at Plan I will show that the summer­
house is very close to the ‘hollow’ road that runs past the
Rectory. At 10.30 p .m . they both heard ‘brisk, clear footsteps
coming down the road in the direction of the summer-house.
When they drew abreast they ceased abruptly. We at once left
the summer-house and had a thorough search round with the
aid of torches and the car headlights. There was no one there.
An hour later there was a sudden “ swishing” in the road, as of
a bicycle free-wheeling downhill at high speed. But this noise
did not die away: it stopped suddenly. It could not have been
what it seemed to be, because the sound went up the slope, and
it was not a motor-cycle or car.’ The reader will recollect that
invisible ‘walkers’ have been heard in the road outside the
Rectory on many occasions; and the sound of horses’ hoofs
galloping along this lane was, at one time, a common aural
phenomenon.
G ho st- h u n tin g in a T h u n d e r st o r m
On July 9, 1943, Mr Robert Fordyce Aickman wrote to me
asking how permission could be obtained to visit Borley Rectory,
with a few friends, who were, respectively, a Press Officer of the
Dominions Office; the Chief Executive Secretary of Vry Neder­
land, the organ of the Netherlands Government; a young Czech
scientist; and Mr Aickman’s wife (E. R. Gregorson). Mr
Aickman said that they were governed ‘ solely by scientific
interest.’
In my reply I gave Mr Aickman all the information likely to
help him, and their first visit was on Saturday, July 24, I943>
and they remained at the Rectory from 9**5 to 11 p .m .
Present: Mr and Mrs Aickman and Miss Mary George, the
Press Officer. Mr Aickman’s report continues:
76 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
It was a perfect evening, and absolutely still, without any wind
at all: and the only incident worth mentioning was that while we
were standing on the first floor looking down the well of the main
staircase, our position being outside the entrance to the Chapel, we
heard a loud crash, coming apparently from inside one of the
‘ cupboards’ [see Plan II] to the west of the drawing-room door.
Some heavy object undoubtedly fell or was thrown, as we saw dust
rising inside the passage. With the house in its present dilapidated
condition, all that can be said to make this incident of interest is
that at no other time when we were on the premises, not even on a
later occasion when a considerable wind was blowing, did we hear
any disturbance at all similar: least of all the same evening—
which, as I say, was an exceptionally still one.
The second visit of Mr Aickman and his friends was on the
following Saturday, July 31, and the party consisted of Miss
George, Mr L. W. J. Jelinek, and Mr and Mrs Aickman. The
report reads as follows:
This visit, in its way, was a sensational one. We arrived at
10 p.m., equipped to spend the night in the house. As we ap­
proached, thunder began to be audible; and, as darkness descended,
a long storm of exceptional intensity for England began—I mention
that the electrical supply of Long Melford was put out of action by
the atmospheric disturbances. The storm continued for about an
hour and a half, making auditory observations a matter ofdifficulty;
but nothing appeared to happen, and the house appeared to survive
the storm without further damage of any description. We settled
for the night in No. 1 Room, not ideal, perhaps, for observational
purposes, but enforced upon us by the conditions. Mr Jelinek and
I spent about three-quarters of an hour, until darkness was com­
plete,1 in the drawing-room, observing the Nun’s Walk. We saw
nothing. We all remained awake, making observations of various
kinds, until 1.30 a .m . From 1.30 a .m . until 3.30 a .m . Miss George
and I kept watch, while the others slept. From 3.30 a .m . until
5.30 a .m . Mr Jelinek and my wife watched. At 6.50 a .m . we left
the house.
The only incidents were: (1) at 113.30 a .m ,, when the storm had
been over for some time, we all heard a sharp crack, as of a pebble
thrown inside an adjoining room; (2) at 1.30 a .m ., upon examining
the house before arranging the above watches, Mr Jelinek and
I discovered that one of the wooden rectangles which floor the
1Their visit was made during the period of British Double Summer Time.— H. P.
E N D O F T H E ‘ G O T H I C * S U M M E R - H O U S E JJ
scullery had been lifted: the rectangle had certainly been in place
upon our previous visit on the 24th, but as it had been placed
behind the door of the room, we had doubtless overlooked it upon
our previous examination during the storm.
The Aickman party again visited the Rectory later in the
same day (i.e., August 1), and no incident occurred except that
Miss George was struck by a pebble.
Mr Aickman, in his letter-report, gave me the interesting
inform ation that the military authorities had ‘ completely
demolished’ the pseudo-Gothic summer-house1 at the end of
the garden. He says: ‘ For no obvious reason, they seem to have
felt called upon to excavate a large earthwork not a few feet to
the north or south of the summer-house, but on the site of the
summer-house.’ We shall see later in this chapter that the mili­
tary did not remain long at the Rectory—and the reason. The
cats’ cemetery, to which I referred in Chapter I, was, Mr
Aickman informed me, completely invisible owing to the dense
growth of brambles. ‘But it is illustrative of the isolation of the
place that the fruit-trees remain laden with fruit.’
E v id e n c e f r o m A m e r ic a
We must go to America for our next testimony, though the
witness in question lives at Borley. In the American Weekly for
October n , 1942, was printed an article, ‘ Can’t Bomb out
Britain’s Spooks,’ which deals with how the ‘ ghosts’ of this
country survived the German air ‘ blitz.’ Much of the article
concerns Borley, and the London editor of the journal sent a
representative to the Rectory in order to investigate. During his
inquiries in the village he interviewed a Mrs Savage, one of the
few inhabitants. The reporter writes:
Mrs Savage lives in a cottage near the haunted Rectory.^ She is
portly, middle-aged, and a hard-headed, reasonable lady. ‘ I have
got no time to mess with things like that,’ she said sharply. I never
did believe in ghosts until I came here. But there is certainly some­
thing strange about the Rectory, The only thing that surprises me
is that they do no harm to people. They want to be left alone, poor
1This is shown in Plate II (facing p. ¡2

lonely things. Each and every one of them seems to tell us humans
to mind our own business.’ Her calm, blue eyes surveyed our
representative. ‘Yes,5she nodded. ‘ I’ve heard sounds from that
place. Queer sounds that couldn’t be made by man or beast, nor
wind nor decay. Seen lights too—often, in fact. Got me into
trouble, they have,’ she said, with natural indignation. ‘The
A.R.P. thought it was me breaking the black-out. Just imagine
that!’
The writer mentions the tradition that the cnun’ is always seen
on July 28 of each year and says, cShe kept her date in 1940 and
1941 and made her shadowy way about the Rectory grounds.’
If, in fact, the nun was seen on the dates mentioned I have no
first-hand evidence for these eappearances.’
Mr H e n n in g ’s N e w s- le tt e r s
Periodically the Rev. A. C. Henning, the Rector of Borley-
cum-Liston, is good enough to keep me informed as to any new
phenomenon recorded at Borley, or any news concerning the
Rectory that is likely to interest me.
On April 16, 1942, Mr Henning, from Liston Rectory, wrote
to the effect that objects had been displaced in Borley Church,
after the building had been locked up for the night. He says:
I thought you might be interested to know of two matters con­
nected with Borley Rectory. The first is the sanctuary lamp, which
is kept burning near the Tabernacle on the altar, where the Sacra­
ment is reserved. Mrs Pearson looks after this, lighting the small
wick each morning and putting it out at night. For about a fort­
night the wick was frequently moved. She told me this, and I
suggested putting a book or cover of some kind over the lamp glass.
She put a psalter over, after putting the light out, and then locked
up for the night.
She was very surprised next morning to find the book on the
floor, especially as both doors were locked and no one could
possibly have got in during the night. She next put a book-cover
over the lamp, and this was removed on two occasions. Since then
nothing has happened. There may, of course, be some simple
explanation, but we don’t quite see how a bird or bat could remove
the book and cover—at least, it seems unlikely to me. Mrs Pearson
looked round for a bird, but we have not had one in the church for
some time.
C H U R C H P H E N O M E N A 79
As a postscript to Mr Henning’s letter, I will add that, during
the past fifty years, several phenomena have been recorded as
having occurred in, or in the vicinity of, Boriey Church, which is
just opposite the Rectory. For example, in my previous Boriey
monograph I have recorded how Miss Ethel Bull, one of the
daughters of the Rev. Henry Bull, informed us that, many years
ago, the heavy coffins in the crypt1 of the church had been dis­
placed. They were all higgledy-piggledy, and no normal ex­
planation was forthcoming—an incident reminiscent of the
famous case of the displaced coffins in a vault at Christ Church,
Barbados, between the years of 1812 and 1820. I have fully
described this case elsewhere.2 Even during my tenancy of the
Rectory it was reported to me that ‘ music and choir-singing5
had been heard in Boriey Church at night, when it was certain
that the church was locked and empty.
M r Henning continues:
The other matter concerns the officer who slept in the Rectory
about a year ago, I think. The chaplain informed Mrs Henning
that this officer arrived there with his men one evening and was so
tired that he decided to sleep there. The men would not go in as
they did not like the look of the place. The officer was awakened
several times in the night by all the bells ringing. He was too tired
to take much notice, and went to sleep again. I understand that
the officer did not know of the reputation of the place.
Very curiously, I had already been notified some four months
earlier that the military authorities had attempted to use the
Rectory, without success. I had filed the information in the
Boriey dossier, but had forgotten it. The information was sent
to me by Surgeon-Lieutenant R . R . Prewer, R .N .V .R ., of
‘ Domus,’ Gore Court Road, Sittingbourne, Kent. In his letter,
dated December 7, 1941, he says:
M y nephew wrote to me some months ago, saying that a friend
of his at Clare had told him how the Rectory had been partially
restored,8 and that the Army tried to make use of it earlier in the
1How wc tried to find this crypt in August 1943I will relate in Chapter X IV .

3The military may have placed some temporary coverings over the rooms, but
no permanent restoration was attempted.— H. P.
80 T H E EN D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
war; but they were so annoyed by Poltergeisterthat they had to seek
quieter billets elsewhere.
Mr Henning’s evidence is important confirmation of the story
sent me by Surgeon-Lieutenant Prewer, whose interesting letter
I will again mention in a later chapter.
In his next letter (October 26, 1942) Mr Henning mentioned
that a mouse had been caught in the church, and suggests that
this particular representative of the Mus m
usculus might have
been responsible for removing the wick of the sanctuary lamp,
and displacing the books, etc., which were used to protect it.
Personally, I think this is hardly possible.
Mr Henning’s letter of September 15, 1943, contains some
interesting information. He says:
An officer’s wife (Mrs Martin) who is staying with us, went to
look at the Rectory on Sunday night on the way to the church, and
became cold all over, as Miss Reid did. She had not read your
book, and did not know of Miss Reid’s experience until we told her
later.
This sensation of sudden and extreme coldness at Borley has
been experienced several times by persons visiting the Rectory—
persons strangers to one another, and at frequent intervals. The
Miss Reid mentioned by Mr Henning visited the Rectory in
August 1937, and, quoting from the report,1 ‘ She had a feeling
of terror, a sensation of pins and needles all over, and felt very
cold, although it was a warm evening. We felt her hands, which
were indeed icy.’ She recovered, ‘but when we returned about
fifteen minutes later the same thing happened again.’ The por­
tion of the Rectory where Miss Reid became so distressed was
on the landing outside the Blue Room on the first floor, at a
place known as the ‘ Cold Spot’—so named because it seemed to
chill certain people. This spot was exactly over a subsidence in
the cellar (see Plan IV). This subsidence was investigated, but,
apart from establishing the fact that it was the oldest portion of
the foundations (ancient two-inch bricks were discovered), dig­
ging revealed no human remains.
On September 20, 1937, Squadron-Leader Horniman visited
1The Most Haunted House in England, pp. 207- 208.
T H E ‘ W A I T I N G N U N 5 A G A I N 8l
the Rectory with a friend. Horniman reports: ‘ What is interest­
ing is that, without any previous information, this friend came
over desperately cold on the landing where Kerr-Pearse5
s friend
did. . . . His hands were much below normal temperature.51
Mr Kerr-Pearse5
s cousin, Mr Rupert Haig, visited the Rectory
on September 21, 1937, and in a letter (October 2, 1937) re­
marks: 'Suddenly, the air surrounding me became ice-cold; my
hands became icy, and in fact I became cold all over and my
hair stood on end. I was rigid. The sensation lasted, as nearly
as I can judge, about twenty seconds.5
2 The temperature of the
air surrounding Mr Haig, as measured at the time, was 6o°
Fahrenheit.
It is therefore obvious that Mrs Martin5
s experience was not
unique. What is interesting is the fact that these *sensations of
coldness5 (whether physical or merely physiological), persisted
to the autumn of 1943. Many other observers also noted similar
thermal phenomena.
My last letter (dated May 4, 1944) from Mr Henning, likely
to interest the reader, concerns the nun. It will be remembered
that in Chapter I, I gave a short resum
e of how Fred Cartwright
saw the nun standing by the gate of the Rectory, on four occa­
sions, in the autumn of 1927. Mr Henning informed me that
Mr Hardy, a foreman painter who has lived at Borley all his
life, told him of a man working on a near-by aerodrome, who
had also seen the nun. He had to pass the Rectory each day on
his way to work (just as Cartwright did), and early one morning
he saw her. He afterwards told Hardy: ‘ I saw a nun outside
that house the other day, and she did look miserable.5 This was
about May 1942— fifteen years after Cartwright’s experience.
Mr Henning was unable to interview the man himself, as
apparently he was then working on an airfield in a different
part of the county. Whether the figure seen was indeed the
veritable Borley nun, or a flesh-and-blood Sister of Mercy on
some business or other, cannot now be determined. If the latter,
1 The Most Haunted House in England, pp. 200- 201. See the experiments o f the
Cambridge Commission, Chapter IX . It was proved that the ‘ Cold Spot* was, in
fact, sometimes colder than the surrounding atmosphere.— H. P.
2Ibid., p. 209.
F
82 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
then the fact that she was waiting at the same spot outside the
Rectory, at the same early hour of the morning, and had the
same woebegone expression, would be a remarkable coincidence
— to say the least of it.
When I was at Borley in May 1945 I interviewed (on May 30)
Mrs W. Newman, of Rectory Cottages, Liston. Mr Henning
had informed me that she had been employed at the Rectory
and had had some strange experiences there. I found Mrs
Newman very intelligent and willing to relate her psychic ad­
ventures. As a girl, she had been employed by the Bull family
as a cook. She was in their service for three and a half years,
from the beginning of 1924 to the death of the Rev. Harry Bull
in 1927. Her sleeping quarters was a large room over the kitchen
(marked No. 3 on Plan III), with a window that looked out on
the courtyard. Her bedroom contained two doors: one leading
to the bathroom passage, the other giving access to our No. 2
room (see Plan III), which she called the ‘ pear room ’ (where
pears and fruit were stored), a term which was new to me. She
carefully locked bothof these doors every night before retiring to
rest.
Because her bedroom was so large, a curtain, made of some
thin, light material, was suspended across the apartment, divid­
ing the room into two parts. Mrs Newman slept in that portion
which did not contain the window. Contiguous to the curtain,
on the window side of the room, were some wall-pegs, on which
she hung her clothes. On several occasions, just as it was getting
light, she was awakened by something— she never knew what.
But as she lay in bed she could see her clothes— or their shadows
—being disturbed on the other side of the curtain. As the light
from the window illuminated her garments, they were plainly
silhouetted against the semi-transparent curtain. The impression
she gained was that ‘ something’ was examining her belongings,
which moved backward and forward between the curtain and
the window. She never discovered what was moving them, or
heard any sounds. There was no draught in the room.
More alarming was the almost nightly unlocking o f the door
leading to the ‘ pear room.’ As I have stated, both doors of her
W H A T T H E C O O K S A W 83
room were locked each night, the keys being left in their locks,
inside the room. But morning after morning she would find that
during the night the door leading to the ‘ pear room5had been
unlocked, and the door left wide open. This occurred frequently.
Finally, she removed the key after locking the ‘ pear room5door,
which was not afterwards interfered with. The key. and door
leading to the bathroom passage were never disturbed. The
only other access to her room was via the window overlooking
the courtyard, many feet below. But this window was never
touched, and was, in fact, often fastened when the ‘pear room5
was opened.
Whatever opened Mrs Newman's bedroom door must have
been inside the room while she was undressing—a fact that recalls
Mr M. Kerr-Pearse's similar experience when he was having
his supper in the Base Room on October 26,1937.1 Borley Rectory
has been notorious for the spontaneous locking and unlocking of
doors, recorded by many observers. The ‘ entities5inhabiting the
house were obsessed with a passion for interfering with doors,
locks, and keys. But the Rev. A. L. Foyster, with his relic of the
Curé d5
Ars, was, apparently, a match for them.
The last witness I will cite in this chapter is Mrs A. C. Henning
(who, by the way, is a B.A. of London University), wife of the
present Rector of Borley-cum-Liston, who gave a talk on the
Rectory hauntings to the Cambridge Women's Luncheon Club
at the Dorothy Café, Cambridge, on April 18, 1945. A long
account of the lecture was given in the Cam
bridge Daily News
(April 19, 1945), from which I take the following extracts:
The speaker explained that her husband took the living in 1936,
but said they found the Rectory, rebuilt in 1863, so unattractive and
inconvenient for living in, that they at once decided to sell it, and
went elsewhere in Borley to live. Because of its reputation it took
two years to find a buyer, and they then sold it for £500, whereas
it had been insured for £3500. Soon after it was destroyed by fire,
and all that now remained were a few bricks.
Mrs Henning spoke first of the visitations of the nun who, local
tradition had it, had been seen for over a hundred years. Numerous
people, including a former Rector, his wife, their children, and their
1 See The Most Haunted House in England, p. 210.
84 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
maids, had seen her, and she had been seen even since the place
was burnt down. All remarked on her sad appearance, the speaker
said, and how real she looked. ‘ The curious thing is that she was
always outside the house, although swishings were heard inside
like those of a nun’s garments. I have heard these m yself’ she
added, ‘ and it made my flesh creep.’
Speaking of Poltergeists, Mrs Henning went on to tell some most
amusing stories-------One of these incidents to raise a laugh was
when the speaker mentioned a tin trunk that suddenly appeared in
the kitchen during a meal, and disappeared just as suddenly some
time later. The ringing of bells had, she said, been heard during
the present war, by soldiers who slept there whilst on manoeuvres
By a curious coincidence, a cousin of a former Rector (the Rev
L. A. Foyster, who used to keep a diary of the happenings) was
present, and was able to affirm that all the things Mrs Henninv
spoke of had actually taken place. 5
Mrs Henning’s hearers sat enthralled as the speaker told them
in an intensely matter-of-fact way which lent both colour and con-
viction to her narrative, about the famous Rectory’s reputed
S o m u ch fo r m y latest ‘ clo u d o f witnesses ’— or, rath er, a few

CHAPTER V
THE ENCHANTED ‘TEA-GARDEN’
I
MENTIONED in Chapter IV that after my article on
Borley Rectory appeared in Everybody's Weekly (August 7,
194.3) editor and I receiveda numberoflettersfromreaders.
Undoubtedly the two most important of these—and certainly
the most interesting—w
ere sent to the editor, who at once for­
warded them to me.
One of the letters w
as accompanied by a long statem
ent or
report, and was sent by Mr Gilbert Hayes, the well-known film
comedian, who has not only appeared in som
e 350 films, but
has travelled all over the world (including 75,000 m
iles in two
years); has enjoyed the delights of seal-hunting in a ninety-ton
schooner; and has had strange adventures in many lands. I
mentionthesedetailsinordertoshowthat MrHayesisdecidedly
a man of the world and not likely to ‘imagine’ things. But, in
spite of his exciting career, he em
phasizes in his letter (dated
August 8, 1943, and addressed from Rose Cottage, Bastanford
Powick, Worcester) that ‘theevents at Borleywere thestrangest
in my life.’
The advent of the war naturally put a stop to many of Mr
Hayes’s activities; so, in September 1939, his thoughts turned to
the sylvan beauties of the countryside; to som
e quiet village
retreat, wherehecouldrestandbeatpeaceafterhisadventurous
life—and to tea-gardens.
Although Mr Hayes has never told m
e this, I imagine that
he and his wife thought theywould retire to the countryfor the
period of the war, and that running a tea-garden would be a
congenial and not too strenuous occupation, and one which at
the same time would enable them to enjoy a rural life with its
many advantages. I can speak authoritatively about these
matters, because I too have lived in a village for m
ore than
thirty years.
85
86 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
So Mr Hayes purchased a copy of Dalton's Weekly, that useful
journal wherein are to be found advertisements inserted by
people who want to buy or sell, or let or rent, properties ranging
from towers to tea-gardens.
Mr Hayes found what he wanted—or thought he wanted.
The location of the ‘house and garden’ was not given, which,
perhaps, was just as well. Borley is ‘ miles from anywhere,’ right
off the main road, nearly three miles from the nearest railway
station, and a long way from a bus route. If I opened a tea-
garden at Borley I should think I was doing well if I had ten
customers a week. I repeat that the name of Borley was not
mentioned in the advertisement. Had it been Mr Hayes might
have made inquiries. Had he done so it would have saved a
day of his time, considerable expense, an infuriating journey
' from London and back, and much disappointment. But he
would have missed his adventure!
I will now emphasize some very important facts: (a) Mr Hayes
had never heard of Borley, and my book on the Rectory had not
then been published; (b) he did not know me; (c) he did not
know that particular part of Essex and Suffolk; (d) he took no
interest in psychical research and knew nothing about it; (e) he
had never heard of any ‘ most haunted house in England.’ I
emphasize these facts because any question of ‘ suggestion’ (or,
to put it more technically, ‘ expectant attention’ or ‘ dominant
idea’ ) or hallucinosis is absolutely ruled out.
So Mr Hayes wrote to the box number mentioned in the
advertisement, and in due course received a reply. Even then,
if either Mr or Mrs Hayes had ever heard of Borley Rectory,
the agents’ order to view ‘Borley Priory’ would not have led
them to connect the two places. I believe that when Captain
Gregson purchased the Rectory from Queen Anne’s Bounty
one of the conditions of the sale was that the house should
be renamed ‘ Borley Priory,’ in order to avoid possible con­
fusion.
I will now let Mr Hayes (whom I have never met) speak for
himself, and I herewith reproduce, verbatim et literatim, the
•account that he sent to the editor:
A N A M B U L A T O R Y E N T I T Y

T he G host of B o r l e y P r io r y
It was in September 1939 that we read an advertisement in Dal­
ton's Weekly, that a house, suitable for conversion into tea-gardens,
was to let near Sudbury, Suffolk. We answered the advertisement
and considered ourselves fortunate when we received a reply, grant­
ing permission to view. The key was at a cottage close to the house,
which was stated in the letter to be ‘Borley Priory.9 We arrived
at Sudbury, and hired a taxi to take us out to the property, which
was some three miles away. It was a bright September morning.
We arrived at the Priory, and walked up the drive and through
the gates into the yard. I asked my wife to go for the keys at the
cottage, and the taximan said he would turn the car round and
wait outside. I walked across the yard, under the glass veranda of
the coach-house, and through to the stables. I stood underneath
a large tree for some minutes, then walked across the yard to a
door in the wall. I hearda doorclose> and footsteps coming along the
drive. I thought to myself, ‘ M y wife is returning.5 I pushed the
door in the wall; it opened, and as I passed through I heard> with­
out fear of contradiction, footsteps behind me. In fact, the feeling
was so real that, thinking it was my wife, I said, ‘You are soon
back.5 I did not turn round. Through the door I found myself in
a lean-to greenhouse. I still clearly heard the sound of feet on the
path. The door closed; I did not turn my head, butfelt that some
one was standing behind me, and as I gazed round the lean-to I
was of the opinion that my wife was still there. I spoke to her
without turning my head, and explained what I considered could be
done with the shelves and glasshouse, outlining my views of what
could be grown. I went on talking, and walked down the side of
the house, and as I distinctly still heard footsteps following me, I
took it for granted my wife was behind me.
I continued on, stepping over bricks apd debris which littered the
path, talking and pointing out various things of interest, estimating
the worth of the bricks and woodwork- as I walked, and still the
footsteps were behind me. Without turning my head, I cautioned
my wife to be careful, and then walked round the front of the house
and came to the well, where I stopped walking. The footsteps were
still with me. I peered around the corner, where the dust-hole is,
and then at the well. I thought my wife was still behind me, and I
had the impression that she was still there. There was certainly some
one behind me. I knelt down and looked at the well, and said: 6We
could fix an electric pump here and pump the water into storage
tanks,5 and I continued to talk of the proposed venture to the
person, whom I assumed to be my wife, behind me.
88 T H E EN D OF B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
Then I distinctly heard the footsteps walk away down the side of
the house. I looked round to see where my wife was going; no one
was in sight! A moment later my wife came to the doorway, and
was a little irritable. I asked her why she did not reply when I
spoke to her. She replied that she hadn’t heard me. She had the
key in her hand, so I said, ‘ Let’s get on with it, and we’ll see the
rooms over the coach-house.’1 The stairs are narrow and winding,
and a little awkward for one of my bulk— some twenty stones. I
suggested to my wife that she should go up and see the rooms
and, if she thought they were suitable, I would then follow her and
go up.
While my wife was in the large room— a combined kitchen and
living-room— she spoke to me because she thought she heard me
on the landing outside. She thought I had followed her up and was
looking at the other rooms. When she came down I was standing
under the tree. She asked me what I thought of the rooms, and
would hardly believe me when I said that I hadn’t been upstairs.
She asked me to go up and look at them, and to please her I went.
I went up the steps, followed, as I thought, by my wife, as I
heard the footsteps behind me. I saw a room in which were a table
and a chair or two, mats on the floor, and on the wall, in a kind of
paper hold-all, were some bills. They were receipts for very small
amounts of groceries; in fact, a few pennyworths of cheese, etc. I
laughed at these, and as I still heard footsteps across the landing, I
made a joke about the grocery items. The bills I returned to the
hold-all, folding them over and stuffing them in. I still heard the
footsteps in front of me, and thought, 4Well, she’s had enough—
she’s gone down the steps.’ As I left the room I stood in the door­
way, and gazed around, looking at the shelves: the bills which I had
afew seconds beforeplacedsecurely in the hold-all hadbeen laid on theshelf!
Notwithstanding the fact that I had folded those bills up, and care­
fully stuffed them into the hold-all, I wondered if I had made a
mistake, but the point wasn’t worth considering, so I promptly
forgot it. When I got down into the yard my wife asked my opinion
about the rooms. I laughed and said they were suitable, and then
joked about the receipts again. She said, looking at me rather
queerly,4Well, there’s the tree you have always wanted,’ and with­
out a doubt it was the best walnut-tree I had ever seen. That
settled the question of taking the property, and we decided to write
to Captain Gregson and complete the deal. We returned the key,
got into the taxi, and reached Sudbury station, where we had an
hour or so to wait. We sat on a form and talked the matter over.
A postman came and sat down beside us, and he, I noticed, was
1The so-called ‘ cottage.*— H. P.
T H E P O S T M A N E X P L A I N S 89
listening to our conversation—which by this time was a little sharp.
My wife had told me she had not seen the lean-to greenhouse; she
had notwalked round the house with me; I had notsaid to her that
the brickwork and wood were valuable; and she had not gone
through the door, and she only joined me at the well. When I
asked her why she didn’t reply she said I had not shown her the
bills upstairs, because she wasn’t there. When I said that I wasn’t
upstairs with her she thought I was trying to be funny at her
expense. Anyway, as the postman was obviously interested and
amused, we changed the conversation by asking him if there was
a short cut from the station to Borley Priory across the fields.
Imagine our surprise when he said,f
iBorley Priory? Are you people
going to rent it?’ I answered, ‘Yes. That is why we are asking
you about a short cut.’ He said, cI wish you joy of it! Don’t you
know that that is the most haunted house in all England?’ Then
he told my wife and me about the psychical research people who
had been to see the place. So now, almost four years later, I still ask
myself these questions:
1. Who came through the greenhouse with me?
2. Who was it that followed me round the house and left me
at the well?
3. Who was in the room and on the landing when I thought
my wife had spoken to me?
4. Who was in the room with me when I joked about the
grocery bill? I folded those bills and placed them in the hold-all
and walked fifteen paces. During that period those bills were
back on the shelf, having been moved two feet.
I have related this adventure many times to various people ever
since it happened. I don’t know Harry Price; he doesn’t know me;
but our experiences, as related here, arefacts.
August 8, 1943 (Signed) G il b e r t H a y e s
I need hardly inform the reader that M r Hayes did not rent
‘ Borley Priory’ with its enchanted ‘ tea-garden.’ His adventures
in the cottage were a flashback to the days when M r and Mrs
Edward Cooper, who occupied the same rooms from 19*6 to
19ig, heard the nocturnal cdog’ padding around every night,
and thought, on one occasion, that every bit of china in the place
had been smashed.
The Rev. Daniel L. Booth, Vicar of St Michael’s, Sutton
Ings, Hull, had a rather similar experience to that of M r Hayes’s,
T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
90
as recently as September 1945. He and his young son were
spending a holiday near Cambridge, and thought they would
cycle over to Borley in order to examine the site of the Rectory,
the summer-house, the Nun’s Walk, etc. They wandered about
the place, and Mr Booth found himself in the thicket at the
bottom of the garden. He heard his son following close behind
him and stop walking when he did. Without turning his head,
Mr Booth began speaking to his boy about the overgrown state
of the grounds. He says (September 22, 1945), ‘ As I received no
reply, I suddenly turned round and found I had been talking
to myself, my boy being elsewhere at the time, though I assumed
he was behind me in the undergrowth.’
What Mr and Mrs Hayes and Mr Booth heard was one of
the commonest phenomena associated with Borley Rectory, but
I have no other record of footsteps having been heard in the
garden. Many people, many times, have heard footsteps in the
house and on the ‘ hollow’ road outside the Rectory. For
example, on March 29, 1939, 1 interviewed Mr Gerald Bull (one
of the children of the Rev. Henry Bull), who was born at the
Rectory, and he told me that when walking up the lane and
approaching the Rectory he, at least fifty times, heard footsteps
following him. He always turned round, but never saw anyone,
and could not account for them.1
Striking confirmation of Mr Gerald Bull’s testimony, and
further evidence for ‘ footsteps,’ come to me from Mr Arthur S.
Medcraft, an electrical engineer, of 102 Ashgrove Road, Good-
mayes, Essex. Writing on August 27, 1943, Mr Medcraft (whom
I have never met) says:
D e a r Si r ,
Having been interested in Borley Rectory, from a psychic point
ofview, for more than a year now, I was wondering if my two small
experiences would be of interest. I have been to Borley many
times, and on one occasion only did I experience two peculiar
happenings.
On arriving at Sudbury one morning about the beginning of last
July, there was no alternative but to walk to Borley, and on this
occasion, it being a warm day with brilliant sunshine, it made the

yards o f the R ectory, I becam e aware o f footsteps follow ing m e and,

leg as I walked, I gripped the case tight in front o f m e and con ­
tinued walking. I heard footsteps again. This tim e they w ere
slower than m ine and I turned m y head suddenly, still w alking.
T h e footsteps ceased as before, there being nothing there but the
em pty road. I must add that I was not thinking o f such a thing,
as m y m ind, up to then, had been on the R ectory itself. By this
tim e I was only a matter o f a few yards from it, and was soon on
the fam iliar drive. Everything wras still. So I decided to adjourn
to the law n b y the summer-house and eat m y sandwiches, keeping
the R ectory in view. As I have said, everything was still. But
about an hour later I heard a tremendous ban g o f a door. I got up
at once and investigated. The place was as still as before. T h ere
was not the slightest breeze. It occurred to m e that if a d o o r cou ld
have slam m ed norm ally it would hardly have w aited for m e to be
there. T h e reason I say 4cou ld 5 is because I do not think any o f
the doors are capable o f slamming in such a definite w ay as to have
enabled m e to hear the click o f the lock at such a distance, as I did.
These tw o incidents, though not very m uch, are strange to explain.
T h e R ectory has never given me a feeling o f depression— on ly
restfulness and stillness. A detail I noticed was that when w alking b y
the French windows there was a strong arom a o f som ething— quite
pleasant— which I could not account for. I do not think it was due
to any growth, although there is no other norm al explanation.
This was the only occasion on which I noticed it. I am not psychic,
and until this visit I have experienced nothing out o f the ordinary
at the R ectory. I have since been there on Ju ly 28 and A ugust 22,
1943, and both visits were negative.
Yours faithfully,
(.Signed) A . S. Medcraft
I have little to add to M r M edcraft’s report except to note
that D r N awrocki and his friends were at the R ectory on the
night o f Ju ly 28, 1943, and were more fortunate than m y corre­
spondent. As for the cdoor-slamming,5 I was at the R ectory
m yself on August 17, 18, and 30, 1943, when excavating for the
cnun,n and on those occasions the doors w ould not close. Som e
w ere off their hinges, and would neither open nor close. T h e
1 See Chapter XIV.
92 THE en d o f b o r l e y r e c t o r y
noise heard by M r M edcraft suggests that the sound was that
o f a door swinging easily on its hinges, and even the ‘ click o f the
lock, as the door fastened, was heard.
The ‘ arom a’ that was so apparent to M r M edcraft m ay— or
m ay not— have been a paranorm al one. B ut m any witnesses
have testified to ‘ odours’ being experienced at the Rectory: '
avender, incense, etc. These w ere pleasant ones— others were
decidedly the reverse.1

CHAPTER VI
A CENTURY OF EVIDENCE
I
N the issue of the Spectator dated October 18, 1940, was
published a reviewby Dr C. E. M. Joad of The Most Haunted
House in England. Three w
eeks later (November 8), in the cor­
respondencecolumns ofthesamejournal, appearedaletterfrom
a gentleman referring to the review.
In his letter the correspondent states that ‘som
e seven years
ago’—i.e., in 1933—heand his familylivedat BorleyRectoryfor
a month.
The morning after his arrival, thewriter tells us, he ‘acciden­
tallydiscovered’ a typewrittenmanuscriptwhichrecorded ‘very
fully’ the psychic history of the Rectory. He apparently read
this manuscript, which was probably a copy of Mr Foyster’s
Fifteen Months in a HauntedHouse, towhichIreferredinChapterII.
From his perusal ofthe manuscript, the writer says that
it w
as very evident that the ‘legend ofthe nun5had existed ever
since the house had beenbuilt, and that her occasional supposed
appearances kindledlittlem
ore thanm
ild fam
ilyandlocal pride.
The stories of ‘concrete’ m
anifestations such a
s your review
er
recountsw
ere,I found, then less thanfoe years old1. . . . Duringthe
w
hole of the tim
e w
e lived in the house neither I nor my fam
ily
saworheardanythingout oftheordinary.
As for the writer neither seeing nor hearing anything during
his month’sstay, I wouldremindhimofthe Spaniardwho chose
NovemberforspendingamonthinLondon, andthenwentback
to Seville and told his friends that the ‘sun never shone in
England’ because all he saw were dense fogs of the pea-soup
variety. I too have visited Borley many times without either
seeing or hearing anything.
I should not have mentioned thisgentleman at all, had it not
beenforhisstatementquotedabovethat‘thestoriesof‘‘concrete’’

manifestations were, I found, then less than five years o ld ’— i.e.}
since 1928. This statement is incorrect.
W hen the correspondent w rote his letter to the Spectator in
1940 m y book was, o f course, available, and had he read it he
would have seen the first-hand evidence for the following ‘ con­
crete’ manifestations, all o f them o f a greater antiquity than five
years:
1886. M rs E. Byford (a nurse) left the R ectory on account
of persistent ‘ ghostly footsteps.’
1900. Four o f the Misses Bull saw, collectively, the figure
o f the ‘ n u n ’ on their own law n, in sunlight (July 28).
1900. Miss E. Bull and a cook saw the nun in the garden
(Novem ber).
1916-19. Between these years M r and M rs E dw ard Cooper,
who lived in the room s1 over the stables, saw the nun
m any times; were disturbed almost nightly b y a ‘ pad­
ding d o g’ running round their room ; saw a coach and
horses sweep through the hedge, across the road, into
the farm yard, and then vanish ; and saw a ‘ black shape’
in their bedroom.
1927. Fred C artw right four times saw the nun standing at
the gate o f Borley R ectory.
I have cited only a few o f the ‘ concrete’ manifestations, ‘ more
than five years old,’ accounts o f w hich were available to the
correspondent when he rushed into print and sent his letter to
the Spectator.
Since m y book was published I have received m uch more
evidence for the early haunting o f Borley R ectory, and this latest
testimony I now propose to submit to the reader.
W hen I was at Borley in August 1943 the R ev. A . C . Henning
gave me some information w hich is as im portant as it is interest­
ing. M rs C . Fahie, sister o f M r A . V . C . Lam bert, the patron of
Liston benefice, informed M r H enning that w hen she was a
young girl living in the parish an old' m an they knew w ell told
her that when he was a boy o f fifteen or sixteen he w ell remem-

bered hearing the story o f a nun being seen at Borley. This takes
the story o f the nun back about a century. T h e present R ectory was
not then built, but the evidence we possess shows that there was
a R ectory, belonging to the H erringham fam ily, on the sam e site.
M r H enning also had an interview w ith another parishioner, M r
Farrance junior, w ho said that the R ev. H arry Bull (R ector o f
B orley from 1892 to 1927) had given him an account o f how the
cn u n s followed the R ector from the church, and dow n the path
to the R ectory front door. M r Bull hesitated whether he should
leave the door open for her adm ittance, or close it. H e finally
decided to go straight into the house and shut the door— w hich
he did. W e do not know the exact date o f this incident, but it
was probably about 1900.
Confirm ation that H arry B ull saw the nun comes to m e from
the R ev. W alter G . Stote, M .A . (O xon), late V ica r o f A ll
Saints, Sudbury, Suffolk. W riting from ‘J en vey,5 40 Farw ell
R oad , Sidcup, K en t, he says (M arch 22, 1941):
I have just finished reading your beautifully produced book
entitled The Most Haunted House in England. It has proved most
interesting, especially as we have known most o f the Bull family
resident in or near Sudbury, Suffolk, since 1919, when I became
V icar of All Saints, Sudbury. The Rev. Harry Bull told me him­
self about seeing the nun. Others have told m y wife about the
coach, etc. I remember at the time that I thought the underground
passages might well repay attention. . . . M r Bull, the Rector of
Borley, I knew very well— not so the succeeding Rectors.
(Signed) W a l t e r G. S t o t e
Still m ore evidence of w hat H arry Bull saw was very kindly
sent to me b y M rs C. H . B. G ow an, whose late husband, C aptain
G ow an, I knew well. M rs G ow an’s m other, M rs Savile, received
a letter from the R ev. H arry Carpenter, 122 W oodstock R oad,
O xford, and M rs G ow an was good enough to send me a copy
o f th at portion o f M r C arpenter’s letter (dated O ctober 3 0 ,19 4 1)
relevant to the Borley ease. M r Carpenter says:
E. has handed on to us the part of your letter about the ghosts at
Borley. As you say, the village is close to Foxearth, and we have
read with much interest the book1 about the apparitions, especially
1 The Most Haunted House in England.— H. P,
96 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
as we knew the Bull family well and some of the people who are
mentioned by M r Price as having seen the ghosts.
When, during the last war, I was a special constable, with Harry
Bull as my superior officer, sometimes I went to spend a part of
my patrol with him. One night he described what he had seen
years before. Walking home from Sudbury one night, he became
aware of galloping horses; then he saw lights coming towards him
and he stepped off the road to let the carriage pass. He saw
distinctly one man or two on the box, driving; they had no heads,
only hands and the lower part of the body. As he watched the
whole thing vanished. Again, one day in daylight, he was in the
dining-room, out of which there was a conservatory. A dog with
him was agitated, and he saw in the conservatory a man dressed
in the same coloured clothes as the coachman he had seen before.
He got up and went into the conservatory; the man .went out and
vanished.
T h e letter from M r Carpenter reached m e about twelve
months after m y book was published. His testim ony is a con­
firm ation o f w hat M r H arry B ull’s sister, Miss Ethel Bull, told
me, and the identical incident is recorded in m y m onograph.1
T he 'ag itatio n ’ of the dog is rem iniscent o f how Captain
Gregson’s two spaniel puppies successively bolted upon seeing
something (invisible to the C aptain) in the courtyard of the
R ectory.2
O ther witnesses who have seen the coach and horses include
Miss M ary Pearson, the Sm iths’ m aid, w ho saw them twice. On
the first occasion they 'w en t through the trees,’ and disappeared.
It was Tike a big cab.’ O n the second occasion she saw them
from the road and 'chased it into the garden, where it dis­
appeared.’ It was a similar coach. O n neither occasion did she
see any driver.3
A s the reader knows, M r Edw ard Cooper also saw the coach,
'w ith glittering harness,’ silently crashing through hedges and
trees. As he stood and w atched it from his cottage window it
disappeared a few yards from him . U nlike M ary Pearson (who
saw none), M r Cooper saw two drivers, as H arry Bull d id .4

R ev. A . C . H enning’s chauffeur, testified to a rem arkable inci­
dent w hich he experienced on M arch 16, 1939 (tw enty years
after M r H arry Bull’s adventure), and w hich is very fully re­
corded in m y previous Borley book.1 Briefly, as he w as cycling
past the ruins o f the R ectory he heard a terrific clatter o f horses’
hoofs approaching from the direction o f Sudbury. As the horses
drew nearer to him he jum ped off his bicycle and, w ith it, stood
right back against the hedge in order to allow them to pass. T h e
sounds passed him, and disappeared in the distance. B ut there
w ere no horses or any living th in g !
Before me, as I write, is a letter from M r Charles A . Boyden,
Sousana P .O ., Alberta, Canada. It is dated O ctober 31, 1929,
and was sent to the R ev. G. Eric Sm ith, w hen he was R ector o f
Borley. His widow, M rs Sm ith, kindly contributed it to the
Borley dossier. T h e R ectory Poltergeists— or an account o f them
— had seeped into the Am erican Press, and had given M r Boyden
a touch o f nostalgia, w hich prom pted him to w rite to the R ector
o f his birthplace. H e says:
Excuse the liberty I take in writing to you, but when I saw the
pictures of the church and Rectory of my childhood days, and read­
ing an account of the ghost story in an American paper, I remember
the story being told to me over fifty years ago and I experienced a
little of it myself. I was brought up in the village of Borley and
went to Borley Church and Bible class, under the late M r [Henry]
Bull. M y mother lived in one of the three houses down the lane
from Borley G reen .. . . I was nine years old when I left Borley, and
have never heard of the dear old village until I saw it in the
American paper. . . . I would be very pleased to receive a letter
from you with news of the dear old village.
(Signed ) C h a s . A . B o y d e n
M r Boyden says that he was not only told o f the ghost story
‘ over fifty years a g o ’ (say, in 1878 or 1879), but ‘ experienced a
little o f it m yself.’ A boy nine years old is ju st o f the age when
any strange experience, such as a paranorm al phenom enon,
w ould m ake a deep and perm anent impression on his m ind and
m em ory. So w e can accept his statement (w hich m erely con­
firms the Misses Bull’s testimony) that ‘ m anifestations’ occurred

in 1878 or 1879, fifteen years after the Rectory was built
Unfortunately, M r Boyden’s letter has only recently come into
my hands. I intend to write to him, and, if still living, perhaps
he will be able to furnish us with more details of his psychic
experiences.
A t page 94 I mentioned a Mrs E. Byford. This lady was, in
1886, a nursemaid at Borley Rectory. Writing from Parsonage
Farm, Newport, Essex, she says (June 11, 1929):
Much of my youth was spent in Borley and district with my
grandparents, and it was common talk that the Rectory was
haunted. Many people declared that they had seen figures walk­
ing at the bottom of the garden. I once worked at the Rectory
forty-three years ago [:i.e., in 1886], as under-nursemaid, but I
only stayed there a month, because the place was so weird. , . .
When I had been there a fortnight something awakened me in the
dead of night. Some one was walking down the passage towards
the door of my room, and the sound made suggested that they were
wearing slippers. As the head nurse always called me at six o’clock,
I thought it must be she, but nobody entered the room, and I
suddenly thought of the ‘ghost.’ The next morning I asked the
other four maids if they had come to my room, and they all said
they had not. . . .l
The above, and other incidents, so unnerved Mrs Byford that
her grandparents removed her from the Rectory and would not
even let her pass the house after dark.
Mrs Byford’s testimony not only tallies with M r Boyden’s
evidence, but also confirms the strange stories which the Misses
Bull related to me as to what happened to them when they were
young. But if further evidence were needed to prove the occur­
rence of paranormal happenings at the Rectory during this
period, it has been supplied— out of the blue— by a long letter
and statement that I received some three years ago.
When my Most Haunted House in England was published at the
end of 1940 copies of it were, of course, sent to many parts of
the world, and reviews of it appeared in journals published in
South Africa and other parts of the British Empire. O n March 5,

1942,1received a letter from M r P. Shaw Jeffrey, M .A . (O xon),
w ho was form erly headm aster o f Colchester R oyal G ram m ar
School. It was written from Lenox* H otel, G ardens, C ap e T ow n.
W ith it, he sent m e a cutting from the Cape Times.1 It was a
note on a review o f m y book that the editor had asked him to
w rite. I was not acquainted w ith M r Jeffrey, and we have never
m et. H ere is his letter:
S ix t y Y e a r s A g o : A n U n d e r g r a d u a t e ’s A d v e n t u r e s
D e a r M r Pr ic e ,
I have just been reading your book about Borley Rectory. I am
very interested because Harry Bull and I were born in the same
year [1862]; we went to Oxford together, I at Queen’s, he at Exeter
College, and in the long vacations I used to go and stay with him
at Borley. He was an extraordinary man; he was always asleep.
Nine times out of ten he never turned up to meals at the Rectory.
Some one had to go and find him. He was always asleep in one or
other of the arbours.2
I was there in 1885 and 1886. You say there were fourteen in
family,3but when I was there I am pretty sure there were seventeen.
There were so many that they went about in cliques, and the
different cliques were only dimly aware of each other. M y clique
consisted of Harry, A lly (who was at Cambridge), Dodie, the eldest
girl, and Freda. The old man [z.e., the Rev. Henry Bull] was a
great sportsman. He used to tell how, after he was ordained, he
drove away from the Bishop’s Palace in a tandem with a smart
ctiger’ up behind. He called himself a ehedge parson’ and never
wore canonicals except for Sunday morning service. He used to
get into his ordinary clothes before midday dinner (Sundays), and
if there was any time to spare he used to lie on the drawing-room
floor and pot at rabbits at the bottom of the garden with a rook
rifle.
I had lots of small adventures at the Rectory. Stones falling
about, my boots found on top of the wardrobe, etc., etc., and I saw
the nun several times and often heard the coach go clattering by.
But the big adventure that would have been worth your while
recording was one time when I missed a big French dictionary
which I had been regularly using for some days. Nobody could
find it, but one night I was awakened by a big bump on the floor,
and there was the dictionary (after I had lit m y candle), with its

back a good deal knocked about, sprawling on the floor. M y bed­
room door was locked.
Another much more startling adventure was in 1886 (August),
and this happened at Felix Bull’s [a brother of the Rev. Henry Bull]
neighbouring rectory. I can’t remember the name,1 but it had a
watch-tower in the garden built by some former incumbent who
had a crazy idea that if he built it tall enough he could see the sea.
Felix Bull was having trouble with a Poltergeist, and he came
over to lunch and told us about it. Next day Harry and I borrowed
the family coach and drove over to Felix’s. He was out, but the
cook said, 4Well, Master Harry, if there’s any foolishness going on,
it’s all along of our new housemaid, that’s what I sa y !’ cWhere is
she? ’ asked Harry Bull. £
Up in the best bedroom, making the beds.’
‘ Right you are, we’ll go up.’ So we went. The room was large
and long, with three windows along one side. We stood by the
door. The maid was at the far end of the room, making the beds.
Close to us was the fireplace. Harry Bull said, ‘ Well, Mary, cook
says you can show us a few tricks. What about it? ’
The maid said nothing, but a tooth-glass came flying across from
the washing-stand, behind the maid’s back, and circled gracefully
round, hitting the jam b of the door just above my head. Just after­
wards the fender and fire-irons moved right out across the room
with a clatter. The maid never spoke a word. Nor did we. We
bolted!
Later on this maid went to London and became a medium.
I saw very little of Harry Bull after I came down from Oxford,
as I was living abroad. But in about 1920 he came over to Col­
chester (I was then headmaster of Colchester Royal Grammar
School) to ask me if I could recommend him a locum as he wanted
to take a holiday. But by that time parsons were beginning to fight
shy of Borley Rectory, and I failed.
This is badly written, but as far as I know it is strictly true.
With many thanks,
Yours, etc.,

BORLEY RECTORY IN 1 8 8 5 IOI
letter is amplified somewhat. Speaking of the Rev. Harry Bull,
he says:
His father was a typical ‘ squarson/ 1 He was very well-to-do.
The family had a good deal o f property round the Sudbury district,
and had one or two more livings in their gift besides the family
living o f Borley. The Bull family consisted of seventeen children,
all at home at the same time during the vacations.
The Rector o f Long Melford, close by, the Rev. G. Martin, had
a family o f sixteen children. The Hyde Parkers, who own the lovely
Elizabethan mansion facing the village highway, had a family o f
eight girls and three boys, and Mrs Bull’s sister, Mrs Fisher, who
lived in Long Melford, had a family o f twelve. So these four
families, closely related, could muster between them no less than
fifty-six boys and girls.
The Rev. Henry Bull was at one time either a Fellow or Gentle­
man Commoner o f Trinity College, Cambridge, for he had in his
cellar large stocks of the famous Trinity Audit Ale which is obtain­
able only by past and present Fellows of the College.
The Rectory was comparatively a new building, but it was
generally believed that it was built on the foundations of an old
convent, which accounted for the ghostly nun who (or which) I
saw several times. The ghostly coach-and-four I heard sweep down
the much-too-narrow lane beside the Rectory so often that I used
to sleep through the noise, and a variety o f disconcerting incidents
happened. I could easily write a column or two on our experiences
at Borley, but I should want the loan of Harry Price’s book to keep
my dates in order, as it is fifty-six years since I first saw Borley.
M r Jeffrey’s important contribution to the evidence for the
early haunting of Borley Rectory is of exceptional value because
it corroborates the testimony of the Misses Bull, Mrs Byford,
M r Boyden, and other witnesses who write of the same period.
It is curious that the Rev. Felix Bull should have had a physical
medium in his employ as a maidservant. I doubt whether it was
a Poltergeist. What Mr Jeffrey saw was a display of physical
phenomena (telekinesis), under exceptionally good conditions.
It is also interesting to learn that, even in 1885, the tradition
was current that the Rectory had been built on the site of a
monastery or convent.
11.e., halfsquire, halfparson.—H.P.
102 THE END OF BORLEY RECTORY
Finally, what a perfect word-picture M r Jeffrey paints o f the
Bulls towards the end o f the nineteenth century! W hat a jolly
family they must have b een ! N o wonder they wanted a house
with about thirty rooms in i t ! In contradistinction to the happy
times remembered and pictured by M r Jeffrey, what a tragic
fate overtook the R ectory! W hen I first saw the house in 1929
it was dismal, dilapidated, cold, silent, and Poltergeist-infested.
Certainly, the Poltergeists were there in 1885, but I fancy they
were a merrier and more good-natured lot than those spiteful
and bottle-throwing 'entities’ that so plagued the Smiths and the
Foysters. Poltergeists are proverbially fond o f young children
(especially girls), and the presence o f so many o f them— whether
fourteen or seventeen— during the period o f which M r Jeffrey
writes, m ay have had an ameliorating effect on the unseen—
though by no means unheard ¡— inhabitants o f the Rectory.
The reader has now been presented with fresh evidence for
the haunting o f Borley R ectory— evidence covering a period o f a
century, and much o f it first-hand. This evidence, plus the
testimony o f the hundred witnesses whose names are given in
The M ost Haunted House in England, plus the additional corrobora­
tive and docum entary reports that I have reproduced in the
present volume, make the Borley case outstandingly the best-
evidenced, the best-authenticated, and certainly the most-docu­
mented story o f a ‘ haunted house’ in the annals o f psychical
research. And no other case has been investigated for so long a
period (sixteen years), or by so many cultured people o f repute,
or so thoroughly.
CHAPTER VH
SOME READERS’ QUERIES ANSWERED
S I mentioned in another chapter, when The M ost Haunted
House in England was published I received some hundreds o f
letters from readers who were interested enough to write to me
for elucidation on certain points mentioned in m y monograph.
In some cases I blame myself for not anticipating these questions
and answering them in m y book. But one cannot think o f
everything. And a few o f the letters raised points which, I
admit, had not occurred to me. So I will answer some scores o f
them now. This is not so alarming as it sounds, as many readers
asked the same question. I will, therefore, take a cross-section
o f the correspondence and give m y replies.
A t least a hundred o f the queries concern the 'nun,9 and as I
am presuming that the reader o f this book has not read the pre­
vious account o f the Borley happenings, I will mention briefly
what we discovered about her— or it— and how we received our
information.
I am indebted to M r S. H . Glanville, his family, and his
friends, for the little we know about the 'n u n .9 M r Glanville is
not a spiritualist, and, until he took an interest in the Borley
case, knew nothing about table-turning or table-tipping, or the
technique employed in obtaining ' inform ation5 via the Plan-
chette, or Ouija Board. But he and his friends decided to try
these methods in an attempt to contact the Entities3alleged to
manifest themselves by the means I have described. A nd they
did, in fact, receive some information, diverse and contradictory,
as invariably happens when mechanical means are em ployed in
order to get in touch with the 'spirits.9 But the information was
interesting— and remarkable.
I will here interpolate a few remarks about what I think o f
Planchette. A Planchette is a heart-shaped piece o f w ood with
two small pentagraph wheels or casters at the top, and a lead
103
104 THE E N D 0 F B O R L E Y r e c t o r y
pencil at the apex o f the heart, so that it moves easily over the
paper when the fingers o f the operator or operators are placed
lightly on the board. It is alleged that the board moves, and the
pencil writes, independently o f the volition o f the person or
persons whose hands rest upon it. In other words, that the
‘ spirits’ m ove it. O rthodox science explains it by asserting that
the board is moved by the unconscious muscular action o f the
sitters possessed by a ‘ dom inant idea’— that is, ‘ an idea fixed in
the minds o f the operators; by the pow er o f habit or otherwise,
and automatically influencing, controlling, or directing their
mental action or outward conduct; or automatically influencing
or deciding their physical condition or action.’ This same argu­
ment is put forth to ‘ explain’ hypnotism (which it does not),
religious fanaticism, faith-cures, dreams, and other abnormal
phenomena. W hatever the real explanation may be, Planchette
works (with some people, but not with m e), and, as I have stated,
some remarkable ‘ messages’ were obtained by M r Glanville and
his friends as the little pencil travelled over the paper. This
technique proved so successful, and such quantities o f script were
being produced, that, finally, m y friend was com pelled to employ
rolls o f wallpaper in order to record all the strange names, places,
and statements that the ‘ entities’— subconscious human or
spiritual— seemed so anxious to convey. It is also alleged that
the mechanism o f table-tipping can be explained in terms o f the
‘ dominant idea.’
The first experiments were made with a small table which
(when the sitters had their hands lightly resting on it) used to
rock once for ‘ N o,’ twice for ‘ U ncertain,’ and thrice for ‘ Yes,’
in answer to questions put to it. Some o f these questions con­
cerned the nun, who was stated to be unhappy where she was,
and would be made happy by a ‘ Christian burial.’ That is, if
the sitters could find her remains.
The sitters were told definitely that she was buried in the
garden, ‘ near the house’ ; near a path on the south-west side o f
the house; that she was buried under trees; that she was buried
not in a coffin, and not under a stone. A few moments later the
sitters were informed that she was buried under a stone, a small
THE ^UN’ REVEALS HER NAME IO5
stone3with ‘ B ’ on it, that was let into the path. Again th^ques-
tion was asked, ‘ Are you certain she is under the stone?’x Aaad
the answer came quite definitely,cY es/ All this information was
obtained at the Rectory itself, at two séances held on October 23
and 25, 1937.
Miss Helen Glanville (now Mrs George Carter) was told
about some experiments with Planchette and table-tipping, but
was given no details (thus ruling out suggestion from that quarter).
She had never used a Planchette previously, but a few days after
the Borley séances she thought she would try the heart-shaped
board. This she did at her own home, and by herself (on
October 28, 1937). She obtained remarkable results. In fact3
the information received was so interesting that it eventually led
to the formulation o f a theory as to who the nun was, and to our
determination to find her remains, if possible.
The Name of the Nx
j
n
W hat Miss Glanville discovered when examining the various
‘ scripts’ that were produced was that the name o f the nun was
‘ Lairre,’ and that the nunnery from whence she came was
situated at Havre. In using the Planchette, one usually asks the
questions aloud, and it is the written answers to these spoken
questions that provide the information. It is significant that the
name o f the novice, which here emerged for the first time, was
given to a girl o f about the same age as the nun, alone, and
speaking direct to the ‘ entity.’ It is also significant that, without a
^question being asked, the first writing to appear on the script
was ‘ M arianne’ (i.e.9 Mrs Foyster), the name that had so often
appeared in messages scribbled on the Rectory walls and on bits
o f paper. So here, in a home at Streatham, was appearing the
, same appeal to ‘ Marianne’ as had so often been seen on the dis­
tempered walls o f a derelict rectory, seventy miles away. I f
there is anything at all in Planchette writing, then I believe that
the nun would not have revealed herself to anyone except a
sympathetic girl o f her own age, or to a young woman such as
Mrs Marianne Foyster.
Other information that the ‘ nun’ conveyed— via Planchette—
106 THE END OF BORLEY RECTORY
to Miss Glanville was that she was buried ‘in the garden,’ thus
confirming the table-tipping ‘ evidence.’ I will not anticipate
too much, but the remains we eventually discovered were found
under the cellar floor. But they may have been transferred from
the garden.
Again, without a question being asked, the ‘ entity’ asked for
‘ Mass and prayers’— exactly as it did at Borley, on many occa­
sions. The nun said she wanted the Mass said ‘ in the house’—
that is, Borley Rectory. She also said that she was once at a
nunnery at Bures, a few miles from Borley. What is more impor­
tant, she.said that the date of her death was May 17, 1667.
The nun also hints that she was killed. She was ‘ hurt’ when
she passed over, and the last tiling she remembered wanting on
earth was ‘ water.’ It was after this that she said the name of
her nunnery was ‘ Havre,’ so perhaps she rested for only a short
time at Bures. She said the Havre nunnery belonged to a ‘ closed
order.’
Miss Glanville’s solus séance was so successful that, three days
later, she repeated the experiment with her father, Mr S. H.
Glanville, and her brother, M r R. H. Glanville, and Mr Kerr-
Pearse. This was on October 31, 1937.
The first question asked was: ‘ Who is there?’ and very clearly
came the reply ‘ Mary,’ amplified in the next answer to ‘ Mary
Lairre.’ So the full name of the nun was then revealed. She said
she was nineteen years old when she died. Again asked where
she was buried, she said, ‘ At the end of the wall.’ It was at the
end of a wall, in the cellars, that we found some remains. She
again asked for ‘ Chant, light, Mass.’ Asked why, she said, T
am unhappy.’ Asked whether through her own fault, she said,
‘ No.’ Asked whose fault it was that she was unhappy, she said,
‘ Waldegrave’— but omitted (unfortunately) to give his Christian
name. The Waldegraves were the owners of Borley and district
for centuries. Then came the startling information that she was
murdered, by strangling, in 1667. The implication is that one of
the young Waldegraves murdered her, and ‘ Mary Lairre’ said
that he took her away from Bures. She also said that she was
French. She again asked for a Requiem Mass, for holy water,

for incense, and for Christian burial. She again confirmed that
she cam e from Havre.
So m uch for the exciting story o f the nun; o f events that were
alleged to have taken place at Borley, but which were revealed
in a London suburban drawing-room nearly three hundred
years later. A nd the story is both reasonable and coherent: A
young French novice comes from her nunnery at H avre; rests
for a while at a similar establishment at Bures, near Borley; is
rem oved by one o f the young Waldegraves, who murders her
by strangling. (A suggested motive for this will be given later
in the volum e.) The novice, wherever she is, appeals for a
Christian burial, and, being a Rom an Catholic, wants a Requiem
Mass sung for her, and incense, holy water and— above all,
prayers. She is unhappy, and wants to be at peace. It is remark­
able that all these appeals were made, in a slightly different form,
to another young woman, Mrs Marianne Foyster, six years pre­
viously, at Borley, seventy miles from Streatham. None o f the
Glanville family has ever met the Rev. L. A. Foyster or his wife.
The full text o f these table-tipping and Planchette writings is
given in the next chapter.
Canon Anson’s Queries
I will now deal with some o f the letters concerning the nun
that I received. The Rev. Canon Harold Anson, Master o f the
Tem ple, says (O ctober 29, 1940): ‘ I have been wondering very
m uch why no one ever tried to open up the nun’s grave— it
seems to me to have been the obvious thing to do, as an experi­
ment— and why no Mass was celebrated.’
O f course, we wanted to find the remains, but where were we
to dig? We were told that she was buried 6in the garden,’ ‘ near
the house,’ 'under trees,’ 'near the path,’ ‘ under a large tree,’
‘ under a fir-tree,’ ‘ near the greenhouse,’ and so on. W e were
told, definitely, that she was not buried 'under the stone’ (table­
tipping) and, equally definitely, that she was buried under a
stone with ‘ B ’ on it (also table-tipping). A few days later we
were told definitely that she was not buried under a fir-tree!
And then we were informed that she was to be found ‘ at the
IOS THE END OF BORLEY RECTORY
end of the wall.’ In other words, we did not know where to look.
Most Planchette and similar messages are contradictory and
usually ambiguous.
It might have been possible to have dug up the whole of the
large garden, could we have obtained the necessary permission.
But the property then belonged to Queen Anne’s Bounty, and it
is highly improbable that they would have allowed us to dis­
figure the garden and paths, etc., by digging for the nun, as they
were trying to sell the property. And I was waiting for a more
definite clue.
As for the stone with ‘ B ’ on it, this was merely a boundary-
stone between two properties, placed there when the Rectory
was built in 1863. At least a hundred readers wrote and asked
why we did not dig under the stone. Canon Anson had pur­
chased thefirst edition of my book. In the second edition pub­
lished in March 1941, as we were being inundated with inquiries
about the ‘ B ’ stone, I inserted a paragraph at p. 158 explaining
our reason why we did not excavate there. I said: ‘ Séance
“ communications” are notoriously unreliable, and it would
indeed be a phenomenon if this stone should have been placed,
in 1863, over the exact spot where the remains of the nun were
alleged to have been interred in 1667.’ I repeat that I was
waiting for a more definite ‘ lead,’ and, as the reader will learn,
this was eventually forthcoming.
As for Canon Anson’s second query as to why no Mass was
celebrated, we tried to find a Roman Catholic priest who would
say this, in the Rectory (as requested), and failed. Dom Richard
Whitehouse, O.S.B., also tried and failed. The trouble was, of
course, that the property belonged to the Anglican ecclesiastical
authorities, and they would have resented a Requiem Mass or
hymn being sung in the Rectory for the repose of the soul of
Marie Lairre. Several Requiem Masses have been sung since
at Arundel and elsewhere.
Canon Anson raised another point. He says:
I wonder also how it is possible to imagine a nunnery existing in
England in the seventeenth century. Except for the small Anglican
community at Little Gidding, in Charles I’s reign, there were no
THE ‘NUN5 INVEIGLED TO ENGLAND 109
religious houses in England, either Roman or Anglican, between
x558 and the nineteenth century, unless I am much mistaken*
I agree. But the nun was a French girl, and the implication
is that she was inveigled to England (perhaps by one o f the
Waldegrave family), and murdered at Borley. Canon Phythian-
Adams’s convincing argument for this forms a separate chapter.
French Nuns in England
Mrs C. Ryan Baines, The Lodge, Lincom be Lane, Boar’s Hill,
Oxford, wrote to me on O ctober 23, 1940, a few days before I
received Canon Auison’s letter, and she, too, refers to the nun.
She says :
To my mind, the published fragments of the séance in which
Mary Lairre communicated have the ring o f truth. To account
for the presence of a French nun in England in 1667 is, at first
glance, impossible. . .. We do know, however, that the Restoration
in 1660 was the date of the relaxation of the penal laws against
Catholics in England. Charles II had been brought up in a
Catholic court; both his mother and his wife were Catholics, in
constant touch with religious bodies. Up till then English Catholics
had educated their children in convents and monasteries abroad,
and as a result, close communication was maintained between
exiled Catholics and their fellow-Englishmen. The Waldegraves
might quite well have been one of those Catholic families. . . . One
of the Waldegraves might not have been a Catholic, or at any rate,
intent on abducting Mary Lairre, as she herselfstates. He strangled
her, perhaps killed the monk1 who had intervened on her behalf,
and the coach (which by that time in England would have been
well established) drove off empty.
Mrs Ryan Baines— with many others— also asks why no Mass
was said for the nun.
The Waldegraves were, o f course, Catholics, and we shall have
a good deal to say about them in a later chapter.
Mrs Ryan Baines also makes the interesting suggestion that
the reason why the nun so persistently peered through the dining­
room window (afterwards bricked-up ; see Ground-floor Plan) was
because the strange Italian marble mantelpiece was adorned
1 ‘MaryLairre,’ in answ
ertoMiss Glanville’squeryastowhere themonk (ofthe
tradition) w
asburied, saidsheknew, butgavenoparticulars.—H. P,
IXO THE END OF BORLEY RECTORY
with the busts of two evil-looking monks,1 carved in multi­
coloured marble, well executed, but sinister.
This mantelpiece (with another marble specimen in the
drawing-room) was brought from Italy, and was fixed by Italian
workmen. It was quite possible for anyone standing in the drive,
and peering through the window (before it was blocked up), to
see these monks plainly; in fact, the light of the bay window in
the dining-room shone right on it. (See Plan.) The first time
I saw the mantelpiece I concluded that the monks had been
placed there in order to recall either the monastic site on which
tradition said the Rectory was built; or, perhaps, to perpetuate
in stone the legend of the monk and nun.
Miss Margaret G. Bruce, writing on November ¡22, 1943, from
Durban, South Africa, said that the wells should be cleared out
and that the remains of the nun or lay brother (of the legend)
might be found in one of them. The main well kas been cleared
out several times during the past three hundred years. As for
the wells in the cellar, these we tackled in August 1943, with
what results will emerge later. The main well is ancient.
The ‘ Smoke’ on the Lawn
The Rev. D . L. Booth, St Michael’s Vicarage, Sutton Ings,
Hull, suggests (December 2, 1943) that the nun might be found
in the cats’ cemetery; under the fir-tree; at the spot where smoke
came up from the lawn; or under the stone marked ‘ B.’ The
reader knows why we did not dig up the trees or garden, and
the reason why we did not disturb the stone. As for the smoke
on the lawn, this requires a little explanation. In my previous
monograph2 is recorded a curious story: A painter named Hardy
was one day painting the outside of the Rectory, just before my
tenancy ended. Suddenly a fellow-workman called him into the
library (overlooking the garden) and pointed to a column of
smoke rising vertically from the centre of the lawn. They
watched the smoke for about two minutes, and then it suddenly
disappeared. The men immediately visited the spot, but could

Ill
THE C
SMOKE5 PHENOMENON EXPLAINED
find neither smoke nor fire, nor anything that could have given
rise to such an illusion— if it was an illusion. No explanation
was forthcoming.
The Dance of the Gnats?
However, M r C. J. Cave, M .A ., J.P., F.S.A ., the meteoro­
logist, writing (October 14, 1941) from Stoner Hill, Petersfield,
says:
There was one phenomenon at Borley which it strikes me might
be explained. Apparently, once smoke was seen rising from the
lawn. Gnats, I think some particular species, sometimes ‘ dance’ in
a long column which looks exactly like smoke. I have seen it once
in England, but I have often seen it in Italy. The first time was in
the evening a little before sunset or thereabouts; little columns of
what looked exactly like smoke were rising over fields and gardens;
I took them for smoke at first, but they were in fact clouds of gnats.
W ell, that is an explanation— perhaps the correct one. But
the csmoke5 disappeared instantly as M r Hardy and his friend
looked at it, and there was no sign of gnats when they immedi­
ately investigated.
Miss M . G. Howell, of Langthorne Cottage, Little Canfield,
Dunmow, Essex, raises the interesting point (February 6, 1943)
as to whether the skull, which Mrs Smith found in the library
cupboard, was part of the nun5
s remains. She says:
Might it not possibly have belonged to the nun in question? And
if so, it would be still more interesting to find the body, which might
prove to be headless. It is true that she was supposed to have been
strangled, but some one at some time might have found the bones
and removed the skull; or possibly a dog might have dug it up in the
garden. Do you know whether the Rev. G. E. Smith submitted it
to an^anatomist before burying it?
M r Smith did have the skull examined at the time, and expert
medical opinion pronounced it as being that of— probably— a
young woman. But there is no evidence to prove that it belonged
to the nun. I think that if her remains had been found many
more bones would have been retained by the finder— or all
reburied. It is unlikely that only the skull would have been
112 THE END OF BORLEY RECTORY
preserved. And if the other remains had been reburied it is
unthinkable that the skull would have been saved as a relic.
Anyway, it was reverently buried in the churchyard by Mr
Smith, so it is too late to do anything about it now. Another
argument against the skull having once belonged to the nun is
the fact that the nun-like figure has been seen since M r Smith
buried it— assuming, ofcourse, that ghosts do stop haunting when
their remains are found and given Christian burial. However, I
am sorry that the approximate age of the skull was not ascertained.
The fragments of bones which we found three feet under the
cellar of the Rectory also included the temporal portion of a
human skull and a left mandible (with five teeth in situ— see
Plate X V III), pronounced by expert opinion to be that of a
‘ woman under thirty.’ But more of this in a later chapter.
The Rev. Stephen F. Sharp, writing from Datchworth Rectory,
Knebworth, Herts, approaches the Mass-and-nun question from
a new angle. Assuming that there was, anciently, a monastery on
the site of Borley Rectory, he says (August 17, 1938):
I note that the trouble dates from scandal in the old monastery
houses. May I suggest that the Mother-Houses of the Order should
be communicated with and acquainted with the facts, and asked
to undertake a novena of reparation? I believe that this course
proved entirely successful in getting rid of similar annoyances in a
rectory in the North of England. I have a great belief in using
spiritual weapons, but fancy they must be backed by a vivid faith
and coupled with a strong personal devotion. That is, I don’t
think they can be used experimentally, but only with a definite
confidence in their power.
When M r Sharp wrote to me my monograph on Borley had
not been published, and he had seen only the newspaper reports.
In these it was positively stated that a monastery had existed,
at a remote period, at Borley. This question has, however, not
been definitely settled, and we cannot obtain positive evidence
to support such a theory. But it is significant that ‘ Mary Lairre’
refers to monks, and another entity states that ‘ Fadenoch’
(Father Enoch?) was a member of the monastery, ‘ Mary
Lairre’ also states that the monk was of the Order of St Benedict,
EARLY HISTORY OF BORLEY
and that he was buried ‘ at Borley.5 She refused to am plify this
information. As a matter o f fact, the Benedictines were com m uni­
cated with, but no action appears to have been taken. I believe,
too, that D om Richard Whitehouse, O.S.B., interested him self
in the matter. W hat we do know about Borley is that Edward III
gave the manor to the Prior and Com m unity o f Christ Church,
Canterbury, in 1362, in exchange for the rights and dues o f the
town and port o f Sandwich.1 So there is definite evidence that
the M anor o f Borley became the property o f the Benedictine
monks in the fourteenth century.
A Bures Convent?
N ot only has it been declared that no monastery ever existed
at Borley, but the ‘ nunnery at Bures5 has also been called a
com plete myth. I f this is so it would be interesting to learn how
the ‘ nunnery5passed into tradition as part o f the nun-and-monk
legend. T he ‘ M ary Lairre5 Planchette scripts mention Bures
several times. The nun declared that ‘ W aldegrave5 took her
away from a nunnery, or a similar establishment, at Bures.2
I have evidence, not very impressive, that there was some sort
o f establishment at Bures— some house that might be designated
a nunnery, or a place where novices stayed, or perhaps only a
convent school. O r it might have been a temporary resting-
place for nuns or novices com ing over from the Continent. M y
information comes from Mrs Susie J. Brand, o f St Feock,
Cornwall. In a long and interesting letter (dated January 5,
1943) Mrs Brand mentions that she and her fam ily were friends
o f the Bulls, and her father-in-law, Edm und Brand, was a
m em ber o f the Suffolk and Essex Hunt. So was the Rev. H enry
Bull. She has known Borley Rectory for many years.
Mrs Brand and her husband lived at Bures3 for eleven years
1Monasticon Anglicanum, by SirWilliam Dugdale (London, 1655-73).
2 There is a Bures-Londinieres in Normandy,^15^ miles from Dieppe, on the
Dieppe—
Paris line. This particular Bures is a village with a fine Gothic church
ofthe twelfth to thirteenthcentury. It is conceivable that the nunentitywas con­
fusing the Normandy Bureswithits Essex namesake, though I can findno mention
of a nunnery in the French village. It is significant that ‘Mary Lairre* said she
camefrom ‘Havre.* Le Havre isalsoinNormandy.

(1910-21), and she says, ‘ The nunnery was then used as a
private house.’ In a further letter (January 13, 1943) she remarks
that the nunnery had then no particular interest for her, ‘ except­
ing from the view of being picturesque.’ Mrs Brand is kindly
trying to procure for me a photograph of the Bures nunnery, but
has not yet succeeded. So I think we can assume that there is
some house in Bures which was at one time used for conventual
purposes. Perhaps this fact accounts for the ‘ nunnery’ part of
the legend.
‘ Spirit’ Photographs
I will conclude this chapter on my correspondents’ queries
with some remarks on ‘ spirit photographs.’ Before my previous
monograph was published M r F. A . Mansbridge, an official of
the Bank of England, and one of the appointed observers during
my tenancy at the Rectory, wrote to say that when printing some
films of the Blue Room that he had taken he saw a distinct1face’
on the wall of the recess to the right of the mantelpiece. He sent
me both print and negative, and, with a little imagination, one
can make out a sort of head of a person with eyes, nose, etc.
But I pointed out to him that ‘ faces’ can often be seen on surfaces,
uneven or broken, such as walls, backgrounds of trees, on the
pattern of a carpet, or in the glowing embers of a fire. I told
Mr Mansbridge that his ‘ face’ was due primarily to normal
irregularities on the Blue Room wall, plus a certain subconscious
elaboration of details in the mind of the person looking at the
picture. When I received M r Mansbridge’s print I examined
the Blue Room, but this visual illusion was not apparent on the
wall itself.
When The Most Haunted House in England was published a
number of readers wrote to say they had discovered faces or
figures in some of the plates. The Rev. N . C. Murray, of The
Vicarage, Ainstable, Carlisle, in a letter (M arch 20, 1941) said
he thought he could discern a face by the side of the arch outside
'the Blue Room (Plate III). I told M r Murray that I too could
see a ‘ face,’ but thought it was caused by the unevenness of the
wall, or marks on the distemper.
‘ s p i r i t s 3 o n p a p e r 115
M r G. Stewart Pople, Registrar of Births, Deaths, etc., an
official of the West Sussex County Council, writing from Bognor
(January 27, 1941), pointed out that in Plate I of my book is a
distinct figure of a nun, or a woman, on the lawn, standing
between the large summer-house and the Nun’s Walk. I must
admit that, with no imagination, the figure can be seen in every
copy of the book that I have examined, and also in the original
photograph. As M r Pople points out, the figure appears to be
dressed in clothes of the period of about 1870: full sleeves, a full
skirt, and with a sort of shawl covering her head. The figure is
about an inch high. But I am convinced that the picture is an
illusion. The head and face are formed out of the background of
trees, and the skirt is due to the uneven lighting of the lawn.
But the figure is quite clear. To those readers who possess copies
of The Most Haunted House in England and who would like to see
the cghost5for themselves, I would point out that the figure is on
Plate I, bottom left-hand picture, and exactly one and a quarter
inches from the extreme left of the photograph. The figure itself
is exacdy midway between the top and bottom edges of the
photograph. The face is rather ancient-looking, with a hook
nose. It has been pointed out to me that it is also possible to
imagine a similar figure one and a half inches from the right of
the picture!
When my Borley article1 appeared in Eveiybod/s M r Edward
G. Sergeant, 10 Knolley’s House, Tavistock Place, London,
W .C .i, wrote to point out that he, and several other readers,
could see a figure of a nun standing by the gateway of the
Rectory in the photograph reproduced in Everybody's. This same
picture appeared in my book.2 This is the gate at which Fred
Cartwright saw the nun waiting in 1927. Again we have a
background of trees, and it is possible to picture some sort of
figure formed by the foliage. But the illusion is not very good.
Miss Laura B. Rawsthorn, of Kirkland, Washington, D .C ., also
(March 8, 1945) calls my attention to ‘ faces of old men, lions,
tigers, and a “ long-nosed man” ’ on the walls pictured in
Plate III of my monograph.

Il6 THE END OF BORLEY RECTORY
I have introduced this question o f ‘ spirit photographs’ (con­
cerning which I am com pletely sceptical) to warn readers to be
on their guard against seeing something that does not exist.
W hen no question o f individual identity is involved, but merely
that o f recognition o f a human face, any three random marks
that are not too far apart or too divergent in size will, o f course,
produce a ‘ face.’ (A n example o f this is the three peculiar spots,
one o f which is the soft germ -pore, on the upper end o f a coconut,
which gives it a striking resemblance to the face o f a monkey.)
Im agination does the rest.1
W ell, I hope that the above letters— a few out o f many— from
my correspondents, with m y replies, have interested the reader.
W hether he has read m y previous book or not, the questions
involved are relevant to the latest developments o f the Borley
drama— m y chief reason for including them.

CHAPTER VIH
THE LOCKED BOOK
B EFORE me, as I begin this chapter, is a book, size io&inches
by 8£ inches, on the morocco binding of which is inscribed in
gilt letters: ‘ The Haunting o f Barley Rectory: Private and Confidential
Report, by S. H . Glanville, 1937-1938.’ The book contains 360
pages, typed, and the contents are excluded from prying eyes by
means of a Bramah lock. (See Plate V .)
The contents were compiled by my chief official observer,
M r S. H . Glanville, during his investigation of Borley Rectory
during the years 1937 and 1938, the period of my tenancy of the
Rectory. If all other existing records of Borley were to be
destroyed, and only the ‘ locked book’ was saved, it would form
a complete history— textually, documentally, and pictorially—
of the haunting of Borley Rectory until its destruction by fire
on the night of February 27-28, 1939.
The contents of the book include: copies of all correspondence;
complete plans, drawings, and photographs of the Rectory;
documents in facsimile; wall-writings in facsimile; extracts from
registers of births, deaths, and marriages; epitaphs and informa­
tion from headstones and the ‘ storied urn’ ; family histories;
ecclesiastical notes; complete and verbatim records of séances,
and much information gleaned through both table-tipping and
Planchette scripts; verbatim reports of interviews with many
persons connected with the case, and names of witnesses; ver­
batim reports of investigators; local gossip and villagers’ tales;
articles on Borley extracted from journals; advertisements and
newspaper cuttings; etc., etc.
The book was deposited in the Harry Price Library of Magical
Literature, in the University of London, in January 1940, and
nearly five years later I withdrew it temporarily from my library
for use in compiling the present volume. No one has seen the
full contents except M r Glanville and myself, and in returning
1x7
Il8 THE END OF BOELEY RECTORY
the book to me, Miss M . S. Quinn, Sub-Librarian of the Univer­
sity, says (November 29, 1944):
Dear M r Price,
Under separate cover and by registered post I am forwarding to
you the locked book and its keys, from the Harry Price Library, as
you request. It has been packed away in the Strong-room here
since you sent it to me and has never been opened.
It must be obvious to the reader why such care lias been taken
to prevent the book from falling into unauthorized hands: it
contains the names and alleged doings of several living persons
who might be pained if the very intimate details of their—
alleged— acts were made public. And some of the Planchette
scripts and table-tipping ‘ information’ is demonstrably untrue.
For example, the ‘ entities’ alleged to operate the Planchette
have sometimes proved to be, not spirits, but living persons resid­
ing many miles away ! These curious results were duc, I think,
to unconscious muscular action on the part of the Planchette
sitters, who, without being aware of the fact, drew on their sub­
conscious minds and automatically recorded the ‘ messages,’ etc.
O f course, some of the information, and many of the plans and
photographs in the ‘ locked book’ (which will for ever be a model
for psychical researchers as to how a report should be prepared),
have already been published in The M ost Haunted House in
England. In the last chapter I told how we discovered the name
of the nun, her age, how she died, etc. This information was
taken from the extracts from Planchette scripts, etc., that were
published in my last Borley book.1 But these were merely abridg­
ments, and, to be quite honest, I did not then attach to these
scripts, etc., the importance that I am now inclined to place upon
them. Also, I found readers greatly interested in the scripts, and
I have received from them new interpretations and suggestions
concerning some ofthe messages, that have been helpful. Finally,
for the sake of completeness, and because I want to make the
history of the Borley hauntings as perfect as possible, I have
decided to reproduce from the ‘ locked book’ the full and verba­
tim records of several of the Planchette and table-tipping séances,
1 The Most HauntedHouse in England, ppf 153-165.
DID C
SUNEX5 BURN THE RECTORY? Iig
most of which have not hitherto been published. For the reasons
given, I am still compelled to suppress the names of many persons
and places. But I will hasten to add that if every one ofthe records
that we possess was printed, verbatim et literatim,
, it would not help
us to solve the problem of the haunting, and would shed no
further light on the history of the ‘ nun/ No, the suppressed
names or passages are concerned almost entirely with the alleged
private affairs of many people, some of whom are dead.
A Threat fulfilled
In the last chapter I remarked that ‘ most Planchette and
similar messages are contradictory and usually ambiguous.5
But Miss Glanville and her brother received (March 27, 1938) a
Planchette script that was neither contradictory nor ambiguous.
The seance was held at their home at Streatham. Here are the
questions and answers:
Does anyone want to speak to us? Yes.
Who are you? Sunex Amures and one o f his men [indistinct] mean to
bum the Rectory to-night at nine o'clock end o f the haunting go to the Rectory
andyou will be able to see us enter into our own and under the ruinsyou will
find bone of murdered [indistinct] wardens [not clear] under the ruins
meanyou to haveproofo f haunting o f the Rectory at Borley [indistinct] the
understanding of which gamenl [large full stop written] game tells the
story of murder which happened there.
In which room will the fire start? Over the halL Yes¡yes¡you must
go ifyou wantproof
Why cannot you give us proof here? We will.
W ell, here is a definite threat to burn down the Rectory; a
definite statement that the fire would start ‘ over the hall5; and
a definite assertion that ‘ under the ruins5 would be found the
‘ bone of murdered. . . ‘ Under the ruins5 is emphasized by
being repeated.
And now for the fulfilment. The Rectory was burned at mid­
night on February 27, 1939; the first part of the building to be
destroyed was ‘ over the hall,5 the fire being caused by the up­
setting of an oil-lamp in the hall; and we found a ‘ bone under
the ruins5in August 1943.
I must emphasize that my book was not published when the
120 THE END OF BORLEY RECTORY
fire occurred, and no one connected with the Rectory knew about
the Planchette ‘ threat.’ It is true that the fire was not ‘ to-night
at ninp o’clock’ as promised, but I reiterate that these séance
messages cannot be taken literally. When M r Glanville sent me
his report I must admit that I did not take ‘ Sunex Amures’
very seriously. When the fire occurred I was more impressed.
When we found the bones ‘ under the ruins’ I was much more
impressed, though it was not on account of the ‘ Sunex Amures’
message that we began digging in the cellar: it was because
Canon Phythian-Adams had made out such a good case for
excavating at this particular spot. It is significant that ‘ Sunex
Amures’ tells us— in effect— to dig ‘ under the ruins.'' Thousands
of houses are damaged by fire without the buildings becoming
‘ ruins.’ But Borley Rectory (which burnt for eight hours) was,
literally, a mass of ruins— as ‘ Sunex Amures’ anticipated— or
promised ! And the ‘ entity ’ wanted us to have ‘ proof of haunting.’
Well, if the fire had never occurred wc never should have re­
ceived permission to dig up the cellars, because the house would
have been occupied. And if we had never found the few remains
that we unearthed it is doubtful if this ‘ sequel’ to the Borley
story would ever have been written. So ‘ Sunex Amures’— or
some one— did us a good turn when the Rectory went up in
smoke.
I will now give the reader the full texts of the Planchette and
table-tipping records (extracts from which appeared in The
Most Haunted House in England1), together with the full texts* of
other séance scripts, not previously published.
Séance of O ctober 23, 1937 (Table-tipping)
Report of sitting held at Borley Rectory on October 23, 1937.
It was held in the passage just outside the kitchen (see Plan II),
beginning at 9.55 p.m. and ending at 10.30 p.m. Sitters : Squadron-
Leader Alan J. Cuthbert, Squadron-Leader R . H . Glanville,
and M r M . Kerr-Pearse.
The report begins:
1Pp. 153-162.
* These form folios 134-160 of the 'locked book.’
121
SOME TABLE-TIPPING EXPERIMENTS
Almost at once the table felt alive, and within two minutes was
rocking backwards and forwards. During the sitting we all experi­
enced an icy cold draught which was generally most noticeable
when the table was rocking violently. A. J. Cuthbert noticed an icy
draught behind his ears, and Kerr-Pearse got the impression that
there was a ‘ presence9 behind Guthbert’s right shoulder. R . H,
Glanville had the feeling that we were being watched. The code
used was: one rock of the table for 4N o5; two for ‘ Uncertain5; and
three for ‘ Yes.5 When a word was to be spelled out the table
started rocking and we went through the alphabet in time with it,
the table stopping at the letter to be indicated. Almost without
exception, we went through the alphabet once before arriving at
the letter wanted, and on some occasions, twice. This made the
spelling o f words a slow and laborious procedure, as we found it
was also necessary to check up continually. At times the rocking
was slow and deliberate, and at others so fast that it was almost
impossible to keep pace with it. The table was extremely light,
having been made expressly for this purpose. It is 2 feet 2 inches
high, and 12 inches square.
The results obtained are as follows:
Is some one there? Yes.
W ho are you? Will you spell your name? Tjisme.
Will you please repeat? TJismong. [Then very indistinct and
uncertain.]
Are you a man or a woman? [Uncertain.]

Will you please spell it? If-chant-Mass-light-erel-caedo.

Is ‘ erel5an abbreviation? Yes.
Will you please continue? Blamui.
[W e were forced to close the above early part of the sitting
because we were very tired and found it most difficult to keep in
touch and at the same time remember all the answers given. At
the portion of sitting that follows we stopped at intervals to record
the replies. Except for a very faint glow (moonlight) from the
kitchen window, we sat in complete darkness. An electric torch
covered with a handkerchief was used when writing replies.]

Planchette Writing
Mr S. H . Glanville says :
We had, some years ago, obtained a Planchette, with a view to
carrying out some experiments. These did not materialize, how­
ever, as the board persistently refused to move; and at none of the
sittings did it write a single word. It was stored away and notused
again until it was taken to Borley, where it at once became ex­
tremely active. It was there first used by A. J. Cuthbert and my
son, Roger H. Glanville, who immediately obtained writings.
Unfortunately, the first small sheet or two were lost. The first
recorded writing begins with that shown under the date October 25,
1937-

Mr Glanville writes (folio 151) in the clocked book’ :
The circumstances under which the following scripts were pro­
duced are as follows. Upon our return from the Rectory I showed
my daughter Helen the scripts that had been produced there
(October 25). She had not previously used a Planchette, and we-
had given her no detailed account regarding our own writing.
During our absence, and unknown to us> she used (at Streatham) the
Planchette with the results that follow. During the course of the
writing there were many ordinary domestic interruptions, such as
telephone calls, callers, etc., when the board was temporarily left.

Notes and Comments
I have now presented the reader with the full texts of all the
table-tipping and Planchette records from the ‘ locked book.’
Actually, many more scripts were produced, and, as I have
remarked, rolls of wallpaper were used to record them. M r
Gianville thought it unnecessary to include them in his book.
Some of them I have never seen myself, though I am reproduc­
ing extracts from the important ones in Chapter X III.
As I warned the reader, I have had to omit many namw,
places, questions, and answers, as they refer to the alleged private
lives of persons, living and dead. Perhaps a publisher, some day,
will print an edition of this book, with the blanks filled in; per­
haps in fifty years’ time. But the reader of that period will be
little nearer to the solution of the mystery than we are to-day.
No information concerning the nun has been omitted.
These records (most of which are here published for the first
time) must not be taken at their face value or too seriously. But
they are an integral part of the Borley story and must be pub­
lished. Some o f the replies are ambiguous and contradictory,
and one or two of the ‘ communicators’ were actually living
people. The reader must assess these séance records at his own
valuation, and extract the few grains of fact from the mass of
what looks very like chaff.
However, there is a thread of consistency running right
through the records: all the ‘ entities’ wanted ‘ Mass, light,
prayers,’ etc.; most of them were ‘ unhappy’ ; there is a sugges­
tion of murder in many of the messages, which have a Roman
Catholic flavour. I may say at once that all the sitters were
142 T H E E N D OF B O R L E Y R E O T O R Y
Anglicans, who were not consciously thinking of unnatural
deaths, or of the ‘ nun,’ who so often put in an appearance, so
to speak. If readers can help us further to elucidate the mes­
sages, or can think of new interpretations, we shall be grateful
for suggestions. I will now comment upon and clarify some of
the references which appear in the records, particularly for the
benefit of those readers who are unacquainted with the history
of the hauntings.
R equests in ‘ L a t in 1
October 23, 1937. This séance is remarkable for some alleged
‘ Latin’ messages that were recorded. They appear to be non­
sense, but perhaps some reader can interpret them. The sugges­
tion is that a monk is trying to communicate.
I n tr o d u c in g ‘ C a l d ib e c ’
October 24, 1937. ‘ Caldibec’ (sometimes spelt ‘ Caldcbec’)
first appears on the records at this séance. Claims to be both
man and woman, with a pet name ‘Janen.’ Wants Mass,
prayers, etc., in the kitchen. The name ‘ Katie’ also appears.
It was at a later portion of this séance that we were told where
the nun was buried. The coat mentioned in the script is the
‘ strange coat’ that appeared, disappeared, and reappeared so
mysteriously during my tenancy of the Rectory.
October 25, 1937- An attempt to discover the origin of the wall-
writings fails, though the ‘ entity’ declared that it knew. The
reference to the tobacco-tin is interesting. An empty tin was
placed in the drawing-room and a chalk ring was drawn round
it, as a control, in case it should be paranormally moved. As a
matter of fact, it was moved : it was found on the landing outside
the Blue Room. Hence the question.
At a later portion of the séance ‘ Fadenoch’ is mentioned, and
‘ Caldibec’ returns. Fadenoch, or perhaps Father Enoch, was
stated to be a monk, buried in the Rectory garden. ‘ Katie’
appears again in the record. Katie’s full name is revealed in the
Planchette scripts, and Fadenoch again communicates. It was
a strange remark, strangely anticipatory of events to come, that
M r Glanville made when he said, ‘ Should the house be de-
S O M E R E M A R K A B L E I N F O R M A T I O N I 43
stroyed ?5 The ‘ entity5saideNo,5but it was admitted at another
séance that they cannot foresee, foretell, or foreknow the future.
October 25, 1937. On this day began the first Planchette
sittings, with poor results. Little information was obtained.
The words ‘ Grew on5 and cGrey5 were recorded.
‘ M a r y L a ir r e 5 says ‘ Se a r c h t h e W e l l 1
October 28, 1937. This séance was one of the most important
that the Glanville family held. Helen, alone, obtained some
remarkable information. For some reason that I cannot now
fathom, I omitted to insert in my previous monograph, when
recording this séance, a piece of most important information.
This is that the nun,‘ Lairre5(who, for the first time, is mentioned
in this script), tells us to ‘ look in the well.5 Not only ‘ the well,5
but ‘ the well in the cellar.5 And not only the well in the cellar,
but the well ‘ that had been filled in.5 There were two wells in
the cellar, one partly filled in, the other completely blocked up.
It was in the latter, six years later, that we found some remains,
pendants, etc. But we obtained our ‘ clue5 from an entirely
different source, as the reader will learn. Not only did I omit to
put this vital information in my last book, but I had completely
forgotten all about it. This is not so extraordinary when one
considers that the ‘ locked book5 had been reposing, untouched,
in the vaults of the University of London for five years, and that
I had not seen it during this period. It is true that the nun said
that a child was buried in the filled-in well, but these séance
messages are full of contradictions, and 90 per cent, ofthe informa­
tion is confusing. Even ‘ Marie Lairre5herself was not sure where
she was buried. However, she was apparently quite definite as
to the exact date on which she died.
When Miss Glanville asked where the mm was buried one of
the replies, as recorded in the script, was Der re. It has been
suggested that the attempted word is derrière * ‘ behind.5 We
know from the script of the séance held on October 31, 1937s
that ‘ Mary Lairre5 said she was French. Is it not possible that
she was trying to convey that her remains would be found behind
something? What remains were discovered were found at the foot
T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
I44
of, or ‘ behind,’ a wall. Support for L er re being an attempt at a
French word is to be found in Canon Phythian-Adams’s interpre­
tation of certain wall-writings, in which other French words were
discovered.
M a r y L a ir r e w a s M u r d e r e d
October 30, 1937. Miss Glanville, at Streatham, was told that
the ‘ nun’ was ‘ hurt’ when she passed over and that the last
thing she wanted in life was ‘ water.’ Two days later, at Borley,
with the Rev. A. C. Henning and Mr Glanville as operators,
Mary Lairre immediately communicated, revealing that her
name was ‘ M ar’ (obviously an attempt to write ‘ M ary’) and
that she was ‘ murdered’ by some one named ‘ Henry.’ She
declares that she was a nun.
October 31,1937. The next day, at Streatham, with Miss Helen
Glanville and three other sitters, the ‘ entity’ boldly signs herself
‘ Mary Lairre’ and suggests she was strangled by a Waldegrave
(Henry Waldegrave?). She confirms that she died, a novice, in
1667, and that she was then aged nineteen. Her remains could
be found, she said, at the ‘ end of a wall.’ She also declares that
she was French, and that she came from Havre. So, bit by bit,
the story of the nun is being gradually built up.
K a t ie Bo r e h a m
At this same séance the name ‘ Katie Boreham’ emerges. We
have heard of Katie before, but the script reveals her surname,
and that she died in 1889, afterwards corrected to 1888, in April.
Immediate steps were taken to consult the registers of Borley
Church, and under ‘ Deaths ’ isthefollowing entry : ‘ Kate Boreham
of Sudbury died Easter Day, 1888, aged 31.’ Kate Boreham of
Sudbury may have no connexion with the ‘ Katie Boreham’ who
was alleged to have communicated at both Borley and Streatham;
but if not, it is a most extraordinary coincidence. Even the year
of her death was given, and ‘ April’ and ‘ Easter Day’ are suffi­
ciently close to be remarkable.1 O f course, some ‘ entity’ might
have impersonated ‘ Katie’— but there is the information, where-
cver it came from, and whoever recorded it. The church registers
1Easter Sunday fell on April %in 1888.
W H Y T H E W I N D O W W A S B R I C K E D U P 145
also revealed the fact that a 4Kate Reeve of Borley died on
March 5* i 87*j 3-god six months.9 But this infant can have
no connexion whatever with the name mentioned in the scripts.
The question asked by M r Mark Kerr-Pearse, as to whether the
communicating entity would visit him at Geneva, refers to the fact
that he was about to take up a consular appointment in that city.
Towards the end of the seance ‘ Katie Boreham5is mentioned
again, and we are told that she died, not in April, as previously
recorded, but on ‘June 13.9 As the Sudbury Kate Boreham died
on ‘ Easter D ay,9 she could not have expired on ‘June 139 too.
So perhaps there is no connexion between the two Katies. It is
all very confusing!
M ir r o r -w r it in g
November 20-21, 1937» This is the last séance recorded in full
in the ‘ locked book5; but, as I have stated, the Glanville family
have many rolls of Planchette scripts, which I have never seen.
But I presume that Mr Glanville transcribed the best of them
into his book.
The interesting point about this séance is the fact that it is
confirmed that the window of the dining-room was bricked up
on account of the nun. The communicator also apparently
knows whose skull it was that was found in the library cup­
board— but refuses to divulge the name. ‘ Mary Lairre9 then
signs herself ‘ M arie9 (which was unusual) and states that the
schoolroom window would ‘ light up at midnight.9 If it did, no
one saw it.
Actually, two Planchette boards were used, successively, at
this séance, as Dr Bellamy brought his own. It made no differ­
ence, apparently. A strange feature of this sitting was that some
of the answers were in ‘ mirror-writing5
— that is, they were
written backward: not at all an easy way to write, whether one
is a Planchette ‘ entity9 or merely a human being.
One last warning. Do not take these scripts— or rather the
information— too seriously. There are ‘ lying spirits,9I presume,
just as there are lying humans. But some of the information is
interesting, even remarkable.

Introduction
The Borley Rectory case is already famous. A con
siderable
volume ofevidencehas beenpresented to substantiate theh
y
p
o
­
thesis that the building and the surrounding grounds are su
b
­
ject to those phenomena usually described as 'haunting.’ T
h
is
material has been collected in a book by Harry Price en
titled
The Most Haunted House in England: Ten Years’ Investigation of
Borley Rectory. The period dealt with in this book extends fro
m
1863, when the Rectory w
as built, to 1939, when the bu
ilding
146
M A N Y T Y P E S OF P H E N O M E N A 147
was partially destroyed by a fire on February 27. The evidence
for the haunting during this period falls into several parts. First,
there is certain matter which one might call historical, collected
by Harry Price, from which it would appear that disturbances
were noted at the Rectory in the last century. Then there are
investigations by Harry Price himselfand his colleagues, although,
as he points out, it is not entirely clear that some of the supposed
phenomena they observed were not produced by normal means.
There is also a detailed diary of phenomena of a ghostly nature
kept during the period when the Rectory was inhabited by the
Reverend and Mrs Foyster: a number of the events reported in
this are certainly unusual, even in cases ofhaunting. Later, there
are the reports presented by a body of observers recruited by
Harry Price; the conditions at this stage of the investigation were
more satisfactory, and the great majority of these observers re­
ported some phenomena which they thought to be of a psychic
nature. After this the Rectory was purchased by Captain W . H .
Gregson, who also experienced a number of curious happenings.
Finally, there are various accounts of apparently ghostly pheno­
mena which have been noted by people, other than those dealt
with in this report, which also refer to the period after the fire
in February of 1939. The phenomena reported by all these
observers vary somewhat from time to time, but attention might
be directed to some of those which have been observed which
are of more special interest, in that they have a bearing on the
material in the present report. As with other cases of haunting,
the most common phenomena were auditory, consisting of noises
such as knockings, footsteps, rumblings, bangings, and even the
sound of horses5 hooves passing down the road outside the
Rectory. Visual phenomena are less frequent: a spectral nun
has, however, been reported at various times, and also various
shapes and lights. In general, it appears that visible spectral
figures proceed silently, whereas footsteps are not accompanied
by any visible effects. At various times true Poltergeist effects
have been observed, including the throwing of objects and the
disappearance and reappearance of various articles. An unusual
phenomenon which many persons have witnessed to is the
148 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
appearance on the walls of vague markings in pencil, and in
some cases short messages, although these latter have not
appeared under good conditions, as some of the markings have.
Effects on two dogs have been reported by Captain Gregson;
the reason for these is obscure. Finally, reference must be made
to the so-called ‘ cold spot,’ which is simply a part of the Rectory
on the first floor at which various people have at several tim^
suddenly become rather cold.
Events such as those mentioned above are not, ofcourse, possible
in Faraday’s sense of the naturally possible and impossible: that
is to say, according to one’s normal concepts these events should
not take place. It is, however, rash to assume that an alleged
fact cannot be true because it is in disagreement with theoretical
considerations. It therefore seemed to a number of us at Cam­
bridge that it would be of interest to investigate the remains
of the Rectory for ourselves, and we were even optimistically
hoping that it might be possible to try and throw some light on
the mechanism of supposed supernatural happenings. These
hopes have not been realized, and after several years our con­
tribution seems small; but it is perhaps not without interest to
other students of the subject. During the present investigation a
considerable number of people (fifty-eight at the time of writing)
have been to the remains of Borley Rectory on twenty-five sepa­
rate nights. Nearly all these investigators were university under­
graduates.1 In nearly all cases their approach to the subject was
one of considerable scepticism. Many of these observers have
reported various events which did not appear to them to be
obviously explicable in normal terms. In the following section
an account is given of the observations in chronological order,
all those events of possible paranormal significance being men­
tioned together with any comments on them made by the
investigators. Most of the reports, which were written on the
results of the visits to the Rectory, utilized the terminology of the
hypothesis of ghosts as a matter of convenience, but this does not
necessarily imply that the investigators considered ghosts to be
the explanation of their experiences.
1Most of these have now graduated: see Appendix I.—H.P.

ACCOUNTS OF EXPERIENCES AT BORLEY RECTORY
Visit i.— The first visit to the Rectory in the present series was
made by A . J. B, Robertson with two friends during the Easter
vacation of 1939; that is, fairly shortly after the 1939 fire.
Nothing whatsoever out of the ordinary was noticed. It was
found that although the building had been rather seriously
damaged by the fire, it was possible to get into all the rooms on
both floors and into the cellars. But it was not possible to
move about the Rectory without making appreciable noise, since
the floor was freely strewn with bricks, pieces of broken glass,
plaster, and other material.
A L um inous P a t c h a n d F ootsteps
Visit 2.— Some time elapsed before the next visit to the ruins,
on the night of October 31, 1941, by A. J. B. Robertson and
I. P. Williams. The gardens and ruins were carefully examined,
and seemed deserted. During the night several things were noted
which seemed worth recording. From 11.55 p .m . to 12.5 a .m .,
12.30 a .m . to 12.35 a *m ., and from 12.55 A*M* 1,10 A*
M*
(summer-time), readings of temperatures were taken with a
mercury-in-glass thermometer. During these periods the ob­
servers were sitting on some stairs next to the pantry of the
Rectory. The readings are shown in Table I 1:
In mentioning these results the observers make the cautious
comment that:
The results are shown on the graphs, but as the upper end of the
thermometer was held in a gloved hand, and in general we must
confess to lack of precautions, these results are not regarded as of
evidential value. They are, however, regarded as interesting
because separate experiments showed it was quite difficult to pro­
duce fluctuations ofthis magnitude by blowing on the thermometer,
etc. The cooling effect at 12.30 is probably due to the fact that the
thermometer was removed from its cylinderjust before the readings
were started, whereas in the other cases it was kept out for about
five minutes before the readings were taken.
1The exact values o f these times may be inaccurate, as it was afterwards found
that the watch was not very reliable.
1 50 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
The original report then continues to describe another rather
curious observation, stating, ‘ At about 12.45 a .m . one of us
(A. R .) observed a luminous patch appearing on the wall
between sewing-room and corridor, containing the stairs we were
sitting on.’ This patch was therefore only a few feet from the

observer. The report continues, ‘ This was about a foot square,
and lasted a second or so, and could not have been due to the
moon. Its centre was about a foot from the floor. We do not
consider that great weight should be attached to this observa­
tion.’ The report continues to describe some noises as of foot­
steps which were hea.rd after the investigators had again looked
round the house, and had been sitting in the sewing-room for
some time (this is a room on the ground floor of the Rectory
next to the kitchen). (See Plan II.) The account states:
We had been sitting there in complete silence for some time (ten
to fifteen minutes), when at about 2.10 a .m . we heard three or four
very distinct and heavy footsteps, as though a person was descending
the pantry stairs.- We feel no doubt about this observation. After
about a minute we approached as silently as possible. One of u
s
(A. R.) on looking at the stairs observed a distinct movement among
the shadows, some dark outline moving from a position partially in

the moonlight, into complete darkness, rather quickly* On illumi­
nating the shadows with a dim red light used throughout, nothing
could be seen. This shape was not seen by the other observer, there­
fore we cannot definitely affirm its appearance. We then addressed
thehouse in general in a loudish whisper, asking any entities to make
one knock for ‘ Yes’ and two for cNo,’ and on asking if any dis-
carnate entities were present, one of us (I. W .) heard a knock. But
on repeating the question, nothing happened. We inspected the
house again, and everything seemed normal.
The report also remarks that the dark outline was found by
experiment not to be a shadow of either investigator. The fact
that the two possible visual appearances (luminous patch and
dark shape) were not collectively perceived is not of significance,
since the observer who did not notice them was not in a position
to do so. It is, however, probably not difficult to be mistaken
with such fleeting impressions, especially when observed in a
supposedly haunted ruin. In conclusion, the original report
states the opinion of the investigators as ethat at least one
phenomenon occurred, i.e., footsteps, as we do not consider these
could have been produced by normal means: and that possibly
some other phenomena also occurred/
E ig h t e e n K nocks
Visit 3.— The Rectory was visited by E. N. J. Angelbeck and
A. J. B. Robertson on the night of December 20, 1941* The
temperature readings were repeated, but this time the fluctua­
tions were not observed. One interesting thing happened during
the night, this being the occurrence of eighteen knocks. This is
described in the original report, which says:
We then moved to the hall and addressed the entities, calling on
Hairy Bull by name. We asked them to make one knock for‘Y es/
two for ‘N o / and three for C
I don’t know/ and we then moved to
the drawing-room and knocked with an electric torch on the wall
in a regular way: unfortunately, we forget the precise way. About
five minutes later we were inspecting some writing in the drawing­
room and deciding it was probably written by visitors, when we
both heard very distinct knocking, of a very regular kind. It con­
sisted of a double knock repeated three times; then a short pause of
a few seconds, when the double knock was again repeated three
T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
152
times; then after another pause this occurred again exactly as
before. This knocking did not seem to be localized at any particular
point, but rather seemed to come from just outside the drawing,
room. It sounded as though it might have been a person operating
a small hand-pump for water, but it seemed rather a peculiar time
for this (12.35 a .m .). This auditory phenomenon would seem to be
directed by some intelligence, but the investigators could not find
any person who might have produced the effect. Later attempts to
produce further knockings were without success. The investigators
concluded that there was a possibility of phenomena of a psychic
nature having occurred.
K n o c k s, R u m b l in g s, a n d F o o t st e p s
Visit 4.—J. P. Grantham and A. J. B. Robertson spent the
night of February 27, 1942, at Borley. This date is the third
anniversary of the fire. The experiment in knocking was re­
peated early in the night, the original report stating:
At 1 1 p .m . we produced knocks in a regular fashion on a door
in the sewing-room; we gave three regular knocks, repeated after
an interval, and then repeated again. At u .6 a noise as of a click
came from outside the sewing-room. As one single noise of short
duration is of no evidential value, we pointed out to the entities
(in a quiet voice) the necessity of making three knocks if possible.
At 11. io, while we were still in the sewing-room, we heard three
heavy regular knocks from the front door: these we consider to be
of probably paranormal origin.
The report then proceeds to describe a visual effect, stating:
At 11.18 one of us (J. P. G .) saw a luminosity appear on the wall
of the sewing-room near the fire when the other observer was look­
ing out of the window: he described it as though produced by the
rapid shining of a torch on the wall. This should be compared with
a similar impression received on October 31, 1941 (by A. R.), and
it should further be noted that J. P. G. had not been informed of
this.
The original report then describes the placing of circular
counters about i j inches in diameter, each on a chalk cross in the
rooms and corridors, 'all over the house. The object of this was
to see whether any displacement of the objects would occur.
Actually nothing was moved. Pieces of paper were placed on
P S Y C H I C ‘ F U R N I T U R E - M O V I N G ’ 153
most of the corridor walls and in most of the rooms, a pencil
being conveniently placed near each paper. Some of the papers
were labelled with remarks such as, ‘ Please write here,’ this
experiment seeming of interest in view of previous claims con­
cerning the appearance of pencil-writing on the walls. Three
small bells were placed at various points on the ground floor,
the investigators thinking that an active Poltergeist might be
able to ring them. However, they remained undisturbed.
During these various operations the observers were in the
sewing-room at one time when a rumbling noise was heard.
They say: ‘ During this, at 11.31, we were in the sewing-room
and heard a strange rumbling noise from upstairs as of heavy
furniture being moved; this was repeated at 11.34, but fainter.
The duration was in each case several seconds. \Ve estimate this
to be abnormal.’ Some further inconclusive noises were reported
later, consisting of one knock in the sewing-room of a definite
kind, a rustling in the garden, and a noise as of a door being
closed, but no significance was attached to these. During the
whole time a thermometer, with a specially protected bulb, was
carried around and read at frequent intervals: the fluctuations
of temperature were only a small fraction of a degree. The bulb
of the thermometer was protected by enclosure in a test-tube
which was again enclosed in a wider tube. The temperature
was about o° C. the whole time.
The report goes on to say:
At 2.57 we had collected all the papers and all the other items.
At this stage there was nothing unusual to report. We were just
saying that perhaps the entities had been frightened away, when
we heard three regular and distinct noises, reminding us of foot­
steps. We disagree as to their estimated position, one (J. P. G.)
saying they were just outside the sewing-room in which we were
in; whereas the other observer thought they were several rooms
away. This is the only observation about which we are not in
agreement.
The next day, on inspecting the pieces of paper, we observed
slight marks in indelible pencil on two of the pieces, and more
especially on one. The marks appear to be meaningless, and have
plainly been made when the paper was folded. Now, the paper
J4 T H E ENl!) OF B O R L K Y R E C T O R Y
containing the most marks was the one. we had pinned up in the
downstairs drawing-room. Further, we had inspected it extra
carefully when taking it down because it was close to some writing
on the wall made since the fire (we estimated), on a white patch
left by the peeling off1of some wallpaper. There were no marks on
it at this stage. Incidentally, we might say the writing on the wall
was probably put there by some visitor: there arc numerous
complicated drawings and writings all over the Rectory of skulls,
etc., but this writing interested us more owing to its simplicity.
The main point is our careful inspection of the paper. The papers
were carried into the sewing-room and placed in an envelope; this
piece we are considering was the last to be collected and was there­
fore presumably outside. Now we had only one indelible pencil,
which we had placed upstairs by the chapel, and this was one of
the first to be collected. It was placed with the others in a pocket
entirely separate from the papers. It is therefore our own opinion
that the markings are abnormal to some degree of probability, but
as it is not inconceivable that we made the markings by accident,
we should like this to be considered only as an opinion. We should
not like to put forward the markings as a definite piece of evidence.
We hope to be able to repeat this under conditions of such exacti­
tude that a really decisive statement can be made. Unfortunately,
after collecting all the papers we considered the experiment at an
end.
We therefore conclude that the three knocks, the rumblings, and
the footsteps were phenomena. As possible phenomena we have
several noises of a non-recurrcnt kind, and a luminosity. As a
probable phenomenon, we have the strange markings on two pieces
of paper.
K nocks and t h e ir Pr o b a b il ity
Even at this early stage of the investigation it was becoming
apparent that the curious events noticed at Borlcy Rectory were
in the main of an auditory nature. This is unsatisfactory, since
these happenings are just those most likely to occur by quite
normal means. The original report on this visit points out that
the repeated noises of the same kind are of much greater signifi­
cance than single noises. In fact, it is hardly justifiable to attach
significance to most single noises of short duration. In the
Rectory, however, one is faced with a regular reiteration of the
same noise, such as footsteps or knocks* It is therefore highly
K N O C K S A N D F O O T S T E P S *55
improbable that each separate noise is an independent event.
Thus on February 27, 1942, the observers heard eight definite
noises in four hours, of which three were regular knocks, three
were regular footsteps, and two were single knocks. The proba­
bility of such a distribution arising from independent events is
extremely small. Let us, for example, consider one knock to
occur at the beginning of a four-hour period. Then if the other
seven knocks have not occurred it is possible for them to occur
any time within the next four hours, or 14,400 seconds, from
the first knock. The chance of any one of the remaining knocks
to occur within the next second of the first knock is therefore
only one in 14,400. Since there are seven remaining knocks, it
follows that the probability of a double knock spaced over a
second is 7/14,400. In the case of a triple knock, the probability
is much smaller. Thus, if the double knock has occurred, then
the probability of another knock within the next second is
6/14,400, giving the probability of a triple knock as 7 X 6/14,400 ,
which is of the order io~7. These arguments cannot, of course,
be applied to effects which form a sequence originating from one
cause— that is, a chain of dependent events. Such might arise,
for example, from a stone rolling down the stairs, when regu ar
knocks would be noticed. In investigating a subject where there
is great doubt, such as that of haunting, one must care u y
record all curious phenomena, even though the events may e
due to natural causes. In any given case a decision is di c t,
it is therefore of importance to consider the sum total o a
possible phenomena. This will be done later when further acts
have been presented.
T h e N u n eA n n iv e r sa r y 5
Visit 5.— Most cases of haunting have by tradition some
particular night of the year when the effects are invana y
noticed. In the Borley case this date is said to be July 2 , w en
the figure of the spectral nun is supposed to appear. The
was visited on July 28, 1942, by J. B. Armstrong, • J* •
Robertson, M . E. E. White, and I. P. Williams. Nothing or
interest was noticed at all.
*56 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
T h e St r a n g e S t o r y of a C l o c k
Visit 6.—J. C. Brown, R . A . Brown, and J. E. Lankcster visited
the Rectory on the night of September 22, 1942. They examined
the ground floor of the building, but found that they could not
get upstairs since a door leading from the kitchen passage to the
kitchen had been nailed up. The investigators, after their
exploration, established themselves in the sewing-room. At
about 11 p .m . several sharp cracks were heard. At about 11.30
sounds of movement were heard in the room above that in which
the investigators were sitting. They stopped talking and listened.
Measured and steady footsteps sounded across the ceiling, of a
distinctly heavy kind. They crossed the room, and were followed
by bumps and sounds as though something were being dragged
across the floor. This was followed by silence for a few minutes,
after which the footsteps started again and lasted for several
minutes. The noises ceased suddenly. There was a slight re­
newal of the sounds at dawn. It would be extraordinarily
difficult to move about in this room from which the noises
came with a measured tread. However, it is unfortunate that
there is no proof that the noises were not produced by a living
person.
Another interesting thing was reported by these observers. One
of them (J. E. L .) heard throughout the night the ticking of a
clock, but this was heard only occasionally by the other observers.
His mother (in Ipswich) woke up during the night at about mid­
night and was puzzled by the sound of a clock. There was no
clock in the room and none in the house that could be heard
there. She wondered if her son was being disturbed by the same
thing. Finally the investigators heard, just before leaving at
dawn, two sharp cracks from the dining-room. They thought
it probable, on reviewing the night, that the footsteps could be
considered to be a psychic phenomenon.
Visit 7.— E. N. J. Angelbeck and A . J. B. Robertson visited the
Rectory on December 22, 1942, staying for the whole night.
Nothing of interest was experienced.
Visit 8.— W . M cG. Aitken and O . B. Howl visited the Rectory
‘ b l a c k m a g i c 5 157
on the night of January 19, 1943: again there was nothing o f
interest to report.
T h e *H orses9 H o o fs9 A g a in
Visit 9.— On March 21, I943j Rectory was visited by a
rather larger party than usual, consisting of G. J. Bell, G . H .
Booth, B. A . Holden, F. S. Marshall, J. F. Millard, A . J. B.
Robertson, and J. H . Waton. While two of the party (J. F. M .
and A . R .) were making a preliminary reconnaissance which
revealed the building to be deserted, the five remaining observers,
who were situated in the garden, heard on two occasions a noise
which they all agreed sounded like a horse stamping upon the
ground. This seemed to originate from the road just outside the
summer-house. Since it was obvious that no horse was there, the
observers thought it probable that the noise could be classified as
a possible phenomenon. None of these five observers knew the
story of the coach and horses. The only other noises of interest
were at 10.38 p .m ., sounds as of a heavy person moving about in
the garden near the pond, immediate investigation revealing
nothing ; and at 12.38 a .m . a noise as of a person shuffling about
in the kitchen was heard by the two observers nearest this part
(J. F. M . and A . R .). The party was in a rather spread-out single
file, and these two members, who were leading, had just arrived
at the top of the stairs leading down to the kitchen. Immediate
investigation with a red light revealed nothing. An experiment
of a kind with a magical formula is also perhaps worth mention.
It would appear from the literature of the subject that Polter­
geist manifestations are affected by prayers in some cases. It
therefore seemed worth trying a formula from ‘ black magic5 to
see if this would have any effect. A formula given by Grillot de
Givry at p. 109 ofhis book Witchcraft, Magic, andAlchemy (London,
1931)1 was read out by several persons. This formula is stated
to have been used by the sorcerer Salatin for conjuring the Devil,
using terms not belonging to any known language. Its result at
the Rectory was, however, nothing, even though an attempt was
made to reinforce the effect by exhibiting at the same time a

pentacle for conjuring infernal spirits, taken from page n o of
de Givry’s book. However, the experiment seemed worth while
in view of the extreme lack of knowledge of this subject. No
temperature fluctuations of significance were noted; no response
to knockings or insults was obtained; no papers were marked;
and certain experiments to show the transport of matter through
matter failed, as always.
In considering the results the investigators thought it remark­
able that the horse noises in the road corresponded closely to
previous accounts, both in the nature of the noise and the posi­
tion from which it apparently originated: this phenomenon was
only a fragmentary version of the original one. This, they re­
mark, seems a rather general feature of the effects noted by the
people from Cambridge.
T a p s , Ba n g s, a n d F o o tste ps
Visit 10.— Borley was visited by W . W . Cook, R . M . Hay, and
P. Wadsworth on the night of April 30, 1943. After a complete
search of the house the observers established themselves in the
passage outside the sewing-room. The door from this passage to
the kitchen was nailed up so that they could not go quickly
upstairs to investigate noises: to go upstairs they had to climb
in via the boiler-house roof into Bedroom 11. (These room
numbers refer to the plans in Harry Price’s book.) Their report
remarks that at 10.35 *we challenged the spiritual world, giving
way to a long burst of scepticism.5 Then at 10.45:
Five distinct footsteps were heard, appearing to come from the
vicinity of the top of the back stairs, either in Bedroom r or 2. We
all agreed that no normal explanation was forthcoming, though we
made no attempt to investigate, owing to the difficulties of quick
access, and possibly for less worthy reasons as well. Challenging
was indulged in considerably throughout the night, but as at no
time, save one or two exceptions, did any reply materialize sooner
than five or ten minutes after each challenge— usually from five to
ten minutes after— we did not record the times. Our challenges
took the form of requesting that if ‘ anyone5were there would ‘ he5
make himself known by tapping or some similar sign, giving an
example each time by tapping on the kitchen door.

Thuds in threes were recorded from time to time, sometimes so
faint that we were doubtful whether there were one, two, or three
thuds. They all appeared to come from the bathroom or Bedrooms
2 or 3. Three times rumbling, resembling that made by a heavy
piece of furniture on casters being moved over the floor, lasting
about a second or more each time, was recorded.
11.31: A scraping noise as of a heavy packing-case being dragged
a foot or two over a gritty floor was observed. It appeared to come
from the bathroom.
12.17: Four taps, as of a light wooden mallet striking a board,
were observed. They appeared to come from Bedrooms 4 or 5.
From about 2.30 the wind started to rise. This made any reliable
recording of phenomena difficult. The sewing-room door and the
doors of Bedrooms 4 and 5 started to bang regularly.
1.30: A loud bang, either from the larder door or the scullery
door, was noted. At that time there was a definite lull in the wind.
A request was immediately made to edo it again.5 Immediately
there was a sound as of a brick „being dropped from a height into
the courtyard just outside the kitchen passage.
After this the wind again rose and no further phenomena were
noted. They finally remark on the fact that next day, on inspect­
ing some sheets of paper they had taken to the Rectory in a case,
a pencil mark was noticed on the sheet facing the bottom of the
case. This they say cannot, obviously, be recorded as anything
abnormal, since there is no definite proof that the mark was
absent before the visit to the Rectory. All the other sheets were
without a mark, as was to be expected since the pile of paper
from which they were taken had not been disturbed since pur­
chasing. The whole pile was scrutinized without finding any
marks. There were no pencils or bits of pencil lead in the case.

Visit 11.— Borley was visited on the night ofJune 8, 1943, by
G. J. Bell, G. H . Booth, B. A . Holden, E. B. Hall, F. S. Marshall,
and P. L. Owen. Their report says: ‘ The only point of interest
lies in the nature of the temperature variations. A steady fall in
temperature was in each case arrested over the hour and then
resumed. W e leave the interpretation of these results to more
competent or more imaginative authorities.’ This point is

illustrated by about seventy readings taken with a mercury
thermometer, at the foot of the stairs from 11.50 p .m . to 12.06
a . m .: at the 4cold spot5 from 12.50 a .m . to 1.06 a .m . ; and again
at the foot of the stairs from 1.50 a .m . to 2.07 a .m .
S t r a n g e N o is e s
Visit 12.— I. R . Gordon and J. R . Palmer visited the Rectory
on the night ofJune 9, 1943. They reported a number of curious
experiences, these again being in the main of an auditory nature.
After describing an inspection of the building and the leaving
of twenty-eight objects in carefully marked positions at various
points they remark on a scratching sound heard at 11.28 while
they were eating in the sewing-room, this noise coming from the
passage outside. Their report proceeds:
11.35 P-M
'— 11*5° Stood by Nun5
s Walk without making
any observations. We spoke to ‘Harry Bull,5 the approach being
sympathetic rather than insolent.
11.50 p .m . : Went upstairs. 12.7 a .m .: While in Blue Room,
I.R.G. thought he observed a whitish object cross the lawn and
disappear into the trees near the boundary-stone: the rapidly fading
light may account for this. The weather was relatively warm, with
young moon and slight ground haze. It was never completely dark.
Although conditions were thus generally good, animal noises were
abundant and distracting. There was no wind.
12.16 a .m .: The sounds of some one walking in the courtyard
were heard, which may have been due to inhabitants ofthe cottage.
u .50 p .m .— 12.34 a .m .: During this period we were engaged in
taking temperature readings at the ‘cold spot5 and in the Blue
Room.
The readings obtained appear those one would expect from
normal conditions, but it is perhaps worth noting one rather
sudden temperature drop— from 610 to 58° in four minutes—
observed in the Blue Room with an unshielded thermometer.
No special magnetic effects were noted at the ‘ cold spot5 with
a compass. The observers after this proceeded to the sewing-
room, and report:
12.50 a .m .— 1.50 A .M .: While on watch near the sewing-room
window many noises were heard, resembling at times the padding
C R E A K S , S Q U E A K S , A N D ‘ F L I C K S * i 6l
of feet on rubble in the passages upstairs and down, on the cellar
steps, and on sticks, etc., outside the window. The noises were
heard in bouts of anything up to a minute, with intervals of ten to
twenty minutes of complete silence. Most of the noises in the
passage were accompanied by single squeaks which would support
the theory that they were due to nesting birds, but since no nests
were found in these places in spite of the general activity of birds
in the building, we thought this unlikely. A possible explanation
of the squeaks would be the movement of the bell-springs, most of
which were bell-less.
1.50 a . m . — 2.5 a . m . : Stood on the lawn. No observations.
2 .5— 2.20 : Inspected top floor, looking especially for birds’ nests.
Spent five minutes standing in the passage outside Room 11.
Noises as of a human knee cracking were heard in Room 11 and
in the Blue Room, but nothing amiss was observed. The thermo­
meters were checked.
2.20 a . m . — 4.35 a . m . : On watch in the sewing-room. Noises
resumed with increasing frequency and loudness.^ They could at
times be heard above our whispered conversation. 3.25 a . m . :
What sounded like a small piece of plaster fell to the ground some­
where in the house— louder, it is thought, than if it had merely
fallen from a ceiling, or wall. 3.45 a . m . : Noises reached a climax,
the sewing-room appeared to creak in sympathy; for over a minute
there was a sound as of some one travelling round the room flicking
the walls with a duster. Other-noises noted included the sound of
small stones being thrown against the wall, and footsteps on broken
glass in the passage outside Rooms 7 and 10. Also the sound of a
tin being kicked.
The investigators then collected up their controlled objects, pieces
of paper, sealed glass tubes, and noted that thread they had used
to seal Rooms 9 and 10 remained unbroken. On visiting the
churchyard opposite they noticed that Harry Bull had died in
the Rectory on June 9, 1927, according to the date on his tomb­
stone. They comment:
I. R. G. noticed that whenever Harry Bull was invoked noises
were observed shordy after. It should be noted that there was
considerable activity on the part of birds and frogs, but frequendy
noises were heard which were unaccountable. As the Rectory is
normally absolutely silent and as the noises were so regular, special
significance is attached to the observations. No sounds were ever
heard while we were moving about.

Visit 13.— The Rectory was visited by Miss J. Camock, J. V .
Owen, and L R. Gordon on the night ofJune 16, 1943. They
had nothing of interest to report.
‘ C o l d S p o t 5 E l e v e n D eg r e e s C o l d e r
Visit 14.— A. Heap and I. S. Longmuir passed the night of
June 19, 1943, in the Rectory. Their report states:
At 11.15 p .m . we were both in the sewing-room and heard twice
the sound ofrubble falling in the cellar. I. S. L. detected the sound
of glass.
At 01.00 a .m . we went upstairs to take temperature readings at
the ‘ cold spot,5making Room 11 our base. At 01.17 a .m . we saw
a white shape at the base of the tree near the glasshouses. The
shape was roughly as indicated. It was about six feet high. I. S. L.
shone his torch, and nothing was seen, but the white shape was still
there when he switched off his torch. The white shape could not
be due to the moonlight, as the moon was down behind the trees in
the background. We put it down to the bark ofthe tree fluorescing.
On returning from taking the temperature readings at 1.20 a .m .
we found the shape was no longer visible.
All the time we were in Room 11 there were various creaking
and chirping noises, which we put down to mice, etc.
At 1.30 a .m . I. S. L. detected a smell in the passage outside
Rooms 11, 10, and 9. He described the smell as a subclinically
fruity smell. It first seemed to come from Room 10, move slowly
down the passage till at 3.00 a .m . it had reached the steps outside
Room 9.
The other observer did not perceive the smell owing to his
catarrh. At 3.10 a .m . they heard a door banged twice down­
stairs not very loudly, but one of the observers (I. S. L .) thought
it might have been a hammering of wood. The temperatures
were read at the ecold spot/ using two thermometers, one of
which was freely exposed to the atmosphere a few inches from
the other, which was enclosed inside a glass test-tube by means
of a firmly fitting rubber stopper. The test-tube was nearly
15 cm. long, and of diameter about 1*5 cm. The thermometer
was nearly 0*7 cm. in diameter. The two thermometers were
placed as far as possible on the 6cold spot/ consisting of a plank
spanning a wide gap. The bulb of the thermometer outside the
A T H E R M A L P H E N O M E N O N 163
tube was resting on the wood. The readings obtained are given
in Table II :

2.40 - 54.0 65-1
2.50 - 54.0 65.1
3.00 - 54.0 65*1
It will be seen that there is a difference between the thermo­
meters. The investigators did not consider this to be due to an
error in reading either of them. On checking the thermometers
the next day they were found accurate and to read the same
temperature as each other. No results were obtained with con­
trolled objects and pieces of paper, or with sealed tubes of liquid
which would indicate certain alleged Poltergeist effects.
Visit 15.— An investigation by I. R . Gordon and R . M . Hay
on the night ofJune 22, 1943, yielded no results of interest.
Visit 16.— A visit by J. H . Angel, I. W . Broomhead, and I. S.
Longmuir on the night ofJuly 16, 1943, was also without interest.
Visit 17.— A visit by R. A. Brown and J. E. Lankester on the
night o fJuly 17, 1943, again failed to yield any results ofinterest.
M o r e F o o tste ps
Visit 18.— E. D . Low, R . M ills, D . B. Snushall, and K . G.
Wilden-Hart visited the Rectory on the night o f September 25,
164 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
1943. They found on arrival two other parties, making altogether
four more persons, so that accurate investigation was made some­
what more difficult. The difficulty was partially overcome by
amalgamating the three parties. The usual experiments with
controlled objects, papers, etc., were tried without any result.
One point of interest was noticed. Their report says:
We then returned to the house at 1 a .m . and remained in the
pantry except for two member's—Leeman, of London, and Wilden-
Hart—who stationed themselves in the kitchen. At 1.30 a .m . six
footsteps were heard by them in the courtyard; immediate in­
vestigation revealed nothing, and we therefore assumed that they
were due to paranormal causes.
T h e F o u r W h istles
Visit 19.— The Rectory was investigated by V . G. Cattrell,
J. L. Howarth, V . J. Smith, and G. L. Squires on the night of
December 3, 1943. To obtain further data on thermal effects a
large number of temperature readings were made by the investi­
gators, using the method of two thermometers, one enclosed in
a tube and one outside. The readings were taken on the ccold
spot5 again, at every minute (with a few exceptions) between
11.45 p .m . and 4.45 a .m . This gave some six hundred readings;
that is a sufficient number to justify the application of statistical
methods. A qualitative examination of the results does not
reveal any striking fluctuations or differences between the two
thermometers. The investigators also set up a stretched-spring
apparatus, which might be regarded as a store of potential
energy. This energy could be released by expenditure of a
relatively small amount of energy. The idea of this experiment
originated in an impression that many Poltergeist effects seem
to result in a decrease in potential energy, judging from the
literature of the subject. However, no results were obtained
with the apparatus. A report on this visit prepared by one of
the investigators (G. L. S.) and agreed to by the others mentions
one rather curious fact. It says:
At 1.22 a .m . occurred the only happening in the night which
could possibly be called suspicious. Smith was taking the thermo-
‘ W H I S T L E , A N D I W I L L G O M E 5 165
meter readings. Howarth and I were eating sandwiches in the
scullery when we heard three whistles at intervals of five to ten
seconds. They sounded like the noise human beings make when
trying to attract somebody’s attention. Each whistle was a little
more insistent than the one before. At the end of the third whistle
we opened the door leading out to the courtyard and asked the pair
on the plank if they had whistled. On receiving the answer ‘ No5
we shut the door, switched off our torches, and waited in silence.
For the fourth time we heard the whistle, but it took about two
minutes before we had mustered sufficient courage to open the
other door and investigate the two rooms opposite the scullery and
the back staircase. We found nothing. Cattrell and Smith recorded
the whistlings independently and noted them as having happened
at 1.24 a .m . Their time is probably more correct as Howarth and
I did not actually note the time until several minutes later.
Sounds of movement and shuffling among some local chickens
were heard just after the whistles by Cattrell and Smith. Squires
thought the whistles originated from the back staircase just out­
side the scullery door, but Howarth thought they came from
farther back in the direction of the neighbouring cottage. The
whistles might have been due, as the report points out, to a
person from this cottage, or to the cry of a bird. But they seemed
rather human. On leaving the Rectory at 5 a .m . the investigators
unanimously agreed that a sceptical attitude towards the Rectory
ghosts was the correct one.
T e m p t in g t h e P o lter g e ists
Visit 20.— On the night of December 6, 1943, the Rectory was
visited by R . Batchelor, C. F. Elms, K . E. Machin, W . E. Ninnis,
D. L. Rigby, and T . M . Robinson. The stretched-spring
apparatus was used again, also an apparatus for detecting
changes in the acceleration due to gravity if they amounted to
1 per cent, or more. It was apparent from the investigations so
far that the phenomena noted by the various observers were
only fragmentary versions of those reported in Harry Price’s
book. A Poltergeist manifestation might perhaps therefore
degenerate to a slight change in the acceleration due to gravity.
The apparatus would have recorded such changes, but actually
none was noted. Other devices were also set up, mainly on the
l 66 T H E E N D O F B 0 R L E Y R E C T O R Y
usual lines. They gave no results, except for one small point.
The report says:
The only thing which might have been paranormal was the fact
that at 12.45 A-M- one of the papers on the wall outside the Blue
Room was found on the floor. It had been attached by a one-inch
nail which was still in place. Thus the paper would have had to be
drawn along the nail for one inch to remove it. The wind was not
apparently strong enough to do this; and none of the members of
the party remembered rushing by or otherwise knocking off the
paper.
The detailed examination of temperature effects on the ‘ cold
spot5 was continued by these investigators, using again one
thermometer enclosed in a tube (to eliminate effects due to
draughts and breezes to some extent) and another thermometer
adjacent to it, exposed to the atmosphere. The observers took
nearly two hundred temperature readings, but these do not
appear to show any features of special interest. The tempera­
ture was recorded for nearly every minute from 12.30 a .m . to
2.30 A.M.
Visit 21.— P. H . Lord, A . G. Phillips, and M . R . V . Weaving
visited the Rectory on the night of March 20, 1944. They ob­
served that the ruin was being demolished and removed, but
experienced nothing of special interest there.
T h e L ig h t in t h e Be d r o o m
Visit 22.— The remains were visited by P. H . Lord, G. J.
Lethbridge, H . P. Lethbridge, T . Sullivan, and R . G. Watkinson
on the night of April 30,1944. The only rooms left in the build­
ing were two bedrooms (1 and 2) upstairs, the floor of a third
bedroom (3), also upstairs; and downstairs the larder and dairy
and two walls of the kitchen and scullery. One point of interest
was noticed during the night: the appearance at times between
3.30 a .m . and 4.00 a .m . of a white, pale, and indistinct light vary­
ing slightly in size. This was first noted by C. J. L. only, from a
point in the garden down by the summer-house: with him there
was also T . S., asleep, the other three observers sleeping in Bed­
room 2. According to C. J. L ., the light appeared first in the
T H E S U M M E R - H O U S E AS A R E F U G E 167
region ofBedroom I, and then vanished after a short time. It then
appeared again, apparently in the room where the investigators
were sleeping, and which faced directly on to the garden through
a door. After staying some time the light vanished : the sleeping
persons do not seem to have been affected in any way. Finally
the light appeared in the region of the larder, first high up on
the wall and then at floor-level ; at this point G. J. L. woke up
T . S., who then also saw the light. The effect could not have
been due to any one of the observers shining a torch, since one
of their two torches was with C. J. L. and the other with H . P. L .,
who was sleeping on it. Mention might also be made of the fact
that on approaching the building up the road from Long Melford
all five investigators noticed a hot wind on their faces, coming
from the end of the belt of trees surrounding the garden. They
thought that heat due to some chemical process among the trees
might set up a convection current and produce the effect.
Visit 23.— C. H . Talbot, H . L. Thompson, and W . F. W .
Southwood spent the night o f June 5, 1944, in the ruins, but
noticed nothing of interest.
Visit 24. An equally uneventful time was spent on the site by
A. J. B. Robertson and D. G. Julian on the night of June 9,1944.
A S é a n c e in t h e Su m m e r - h o u se
Visit 25. The site was visited by P. Brennan, P. Brown, C. J.
Lethbridge, R . G. Watkinson, and D. Williams on the night of
July 22, 1944, with the object of investigating; and, unknown to
these five people, by E. R. Broome, P. J. Farr, L. B. Hunt, and
P. H . Lord with the object ofproducing some faked‘ phenomena *
for the benefit of the investigators. The investigators, on arriving
and finding the Rectory non-existent, retired to the summer­
house to sleep : they therefore completely failed to notice several
traverses of the lawn by an ‘ apparition.9 However, by some
Poltergeist ‘ manifestations,9 the attention of the investigators
was drawn to the ‘ apparition,5 consisting actually of P. H . Lord
.with appropriate disguises. The silent movements of the appari­
tion and its sudden disappearance (it was illuminated with a
torch) led the investigators to think it was genuine. They
l 68 T H E E N D O F B O R L E V R E C T O R Y
commented on the possibility of the Poltergeist effects being pro­
duced by normal means. At about 3 a .m . the jokers retired to a
haystack for the night. At about 3.15 a .m . a considerable
number of faint knockings were heard coming apparently from
the summer-house somewhere among the observers : the position
could not be precisely located, and seemed different to the
various persons. After some minutes the investigators questioned
the knockings with a code, of one knock for ‘ Yes,’ two for 5N o,’
and three for ‘ Uncertain.3 Intelligible replies to their questions
were then obtained until about 4 a .m .1 The knockings claimed to
be produced by a nun who had died about 1250 in some manner
about which she seemed vague. She stated that she could be
helped by a minister, although not a Presbyterian one, and made
several other interesting comments, including two distinctly
erroneous ones when she claimed to be responsible for the faked
apparition and the Poltergeist effects. A t about 4 a .m . there
followed fifteen or eighteen knocks in quick succession, after
which they terminated. The practical jokers deny having pro­
duced this effect.
G e n e r a l D iscussion o f O b se r v a t io n s
During the course of these investigations fifty-eight persons
have spent one or more nights at the remains of the Rectory. O f
these people, seventeen have reported nothing at all out of the
ordinary, twenty-two have commented on incidents which they
thought might not be expected to occur in the ordinary way;
and nineteen have described events which appeared to them to
be rather strange. The various unusual and curious happenings
recorded by the investigators fall into five categories. First and
most frequent are the auditory phenomena. Their occurrence
seems to be reasonably well established, although, no doubt,
divergent views could be advanced to explain the various noises.
Secondly, there are certain cases of visual phenomena : they are,
however, few, and cannot be said to be established with any
certainty* Thirdly, there is one doubtful case of the displacement
of an object. Fourthly, there are two instances, both unsatisfac-

tory, of the appearance of markings in pencil on paper. Finally
there are certain temperature effects. It is convenient to con­
sider each of the above categories separately.
So many of the investigators have described different sounds
that it does not seem necessary to doubt the fact of the occurrence
of this class of phenomenon. Whether it is necessary to advance
any explanation for these noises other than purely normal events
— as, for example, beams creaking and doors banging— is a
problem on which it is perhaps desirable to express less decisive
views. The noises are variously described by the investigators as
footsteps, knockings, tappings, hammerings, thuds, bangs, cracks,
rumblings, the padding of feet, the stamping of horses5hooves,
and whistlings. In a number of cases the footsteps are distin­
guished from the other noises by the fact that they appear to
move along, sometimes travelling round a room or along a
corridor (e.g., Visits 2, 6, and 12). In general, the footsteps
appear to arise spontaneously, whereas the knockings and thuds
are most frequently noted some five or ten minutes after an
investigator has endeavoured to make any unseen intelligent
being which might be present manifest itself. This latter feature
is noticeable in Visits 3, 4, 10, 12, and 25, and is of importance
in suggesting that these particular noises are not simply random
events, but appear to be connected with some kind ofintelligence.
This is strongly indicated in Visit 25, when the knockings were
able to answer a number of questions, although perhaps without
accuracy. The auditory phenomena of all types usually consist
of the regular repetition of the same noise for a short time. This
time is usually only of the order of seconds, but more rarely may
rise to a considerable number of minutes (Visits 6 and 25). The
regularity of some of the noises has been commented on in some
cases ([e.g., Visits 3, 4, and 6). A feature of some importance is
that the sounds are perceived by all the observers in a suitable
position to do so; the only exception to this generalization is one
knock in Visit 2. This fact renders more difficult any hypothesis
based on the assumption of the subjective nature of these noises.
Another important generalization becomes apparent on examin­
ing the distribution of the noises in the building with respect to
1 70 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
the position of the observers. In nearly every case in which the
location of the noises is described, they are separated from the
observers by one wall or ceiling: in a very few cases there may be
more than one wall intervening (Visits 10 and 12), and in one
case noises were produced in the room in which the observers
were situated (Visit 12). No simple relation of this kind seems
to hold for the few noises arising in the grounds of the Rectory
or the summer-house (Visit 25). It is also apparent from the
various accounts that the noises are heard more especially when
the observers are in the sewing-room (Visits 2, 4, 6, and 12, for
example) or very near to it (e.g., Visits 10 and 18). It is very
unusual for noises to be noted when the observers are moving
about in the ruins.
Turning next to the visual phenomena, it must be noted that
even the occurrence of the happenings is not beyond doubt.
Only six cases arise: two luminous patches of light on the walls,
each of short duration (Visits 2 and 4 ); one black shape or dark
outline (Visit 2 ); one whitish object crossing the lawn (Visit 12);
one white shape at the base of a tree (Visit 14); and one indistinct
light (Visit 22). The first four of these appearances were noted
by one observer only, and then only under rather unsatisfactory
conditions and for only a brief instant; it therefore seems best to
attach little weight to these observations. The last two visual
appearances, being of longer duration and perceived by two
observers, are more difficult to explain away. However, it is
difficult to draw any conclusions from these shapes and lights.
It is desirable that further cases should be investigated. The
fundamental question as to whether the visual appearances
described in cases of haunting are subjective or not seems to be
not at all clear from evidence at present available, although this
is clearly a most important fact requiring to be established in the
study of such phenomena.
During the whole of this investigation of the Rectory only one
possible case of the displacement of an object was noticed
(Visit 20), and this might have arisen in several normal ways.
Although certain of the auditory phenomena resemble the effects
usually ascribed to Poltergeist activity, the more specific Polter-
T E M P E R A T U R E V A R I A T I O N S 171
geist manifestation of throwing and moving objects has been
absent during these investigations.
The two cases of markings appearing on paper are clearly not
decisive, especially that in Visit io. The markings appearing in
Visit 14 are somewhat strange, but the suggestion of the investi­
gators that they could have put them there by accident offers
an explanation which might be accepted, in view of the fact that
no markings were obtained on repeating the experiment on later
occasions.
■ There remain only the few cases of temperature variations.
.The fluctuations noted in Visit 2 are large, but there is no
adequate control, owing to the short time for which the readings
were taken. At present it seems best to regard these variations
as interesting without attaching any special significance to them.
During Visit 4 a very curious effect was noted: a final difference
in reading between two neighbouring thermometers of 110 F.,
this final steady value being gradually attained over a period of
about one hour. The cooler thermometer was enclosed in a
glass test-tube, whereas the other thermometer, giving a steady
reading throughout, was freely exposed to the atmosphere. The
enclosed thermometer therefore registers the temperature of a
system which is thermally insulated to some extent since heat-
flow inside the glass tube should be determined mainly by
thermal conduction. One explanation which might be advanced
is that the observers in reading the thermometers made a mistake
of ten degrees, noting the reading of the enclosed thermometer
as 540when it was really 64°. The difference would then become
only one degree, which might arise as a sum of experimental
errors. This hypothesis also required that initially— that is, at
1a .m .— the true temperature of the enclosed thermometer should
be 70*20
— that is, 5*10 F. above the temperature of its surround­
ings. This might have happened in setting up the thermometers.
The rate of cooling of the enclosed thermometer would be slow
on account of the partial thermal insulation mentioned above.
This explanation, however, is not in agreement with the state­
ment of the experimenters that the apparent difference in read­
ing was not due to errors in observing the thermometer scales.
172 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
It is possibly worth noting that this effect of a difference in
readings between an enclosed and a freely exposed thermometer
would also arise if, by some unknown mechanism, heat was
being removed from the air in the neighbourhood of the ccold
spot,3 a possibility which is suggested from certain cases of
physical mediumship. The air outside the closed tube would be
continuously replaced by slight breezes and the effects of turbu­
lence of various kinds, whereas that inside the tube, being com­
pletely enclosed, would cool until the rate of flow of heat to the
enclosed air from the outside became equal to the rate of removal
of heat by the unknown mechanism.
If any mechanism involving the removal of heat from the air
can indeed operate it is clearly of interest from a thermodynamic
viewpoint. Temperature drops resulting in a given volume of air
subjected to the process will clearly become greater as heat-flow
to the air is impeded. It is perhaps worthwhile to discuss the
theory of the readings of thermometers enclosed in cylindrical
tubes when heat can be removed from the air. Consider a
cylinder of radius R containing along its axis a thermometer of
radius r, and let the cylinder contain air ofthermal conductivity k.
It is first necessary to see whether convection is likely to be of any
importance. This is best done by evaluating GrasshoPs criterion
G, given by
G = D 3 d2g a V/n2
where D is the diameter of the vessel, g is the acceleration of
gravity, V is the temperature difference, and d, a, and n refer
to the density, coefficient of expansion, and viscosity of the air
respectively. Taking D = 1-5 cm., V = 6° C ., and inserting
appropriate values for the other quantities, gives for the order
of magnitude of G about io 3. It seems generally agreed that
convection is small compared with conduction for such values
of the non-dimensional Grasshof criterion. The next step is
therefore to consider the steady-state temperature distribution
inside the tube when heat is being removed from the air in it
at a rate W per unit volume. In the case ofa tube having a radius
small compared with its length, only heat-flow perpendicular to
T H E R M O D Y N A M I C S 173
the walls need be considered to obtain a sufficiently close ap­
proximation. The isothermal surfaces are then concentric cylin­
ders. Considering a unit length of one such concentric cylinder
with radius x and having a temperature T , then in the steady
state the quantity of heat flowing in through the surface must
equal the quantity removed in the appropriate volume enclosed
by that surface during the same time interval. The heat-
conduction equation
heat-flow =
(thermal conductivity) X (temperature difference) x (area)
(length)
therefore becomes
W (7r
*2— xr2)
ZkXTrdT
dx
since the isothermal surface of radius x + dx has temperature
T + dT. If now Tr is the temperature at x = r and Tr that at
x = R the above equation can be written
Putting T r — Tr = 6° C ., R — 0*75 cm., r = 0*35 cm ., and
k = 6 X 10-5cals, cm .-1 sec. - 10 C .-1
— that is, values appro­
priate for the effect noted in Visit 14— gives for W the value of
about 0*006 calories per cubic centimetre per second. This is
the rate of heat removal required to produce the observed
temperature difference.
It is also possible to calculate the rate of cooling of the thermo­
meter in the tube when heat is being removed at a constant rate
per unit volume from the air in the tube. This involves solving
the general partial differential equation of heat conduction with
i 74 t h e E N D O F b o r l e y r e c t o r y
appropriate boundary conditions. The problem has been dealt
with by E. D. Low. He obtains a solution in terms of Bessel
functions, and the calculated rate of cooling of the thermometer
using the above numerical value for W agrees with the observed
rate within a factor of two. The cooling curve can be approxi­
mated to by an exponential decay on expanding the various
functions. Since the unsteady-state problem involves specific
heat terms which are absent in the elementary steady-state
formulation, there is no reason why the two calculations should
both agree with the experimental data. The fact that they do
might, however, be fortuitous.
The above treatment is, of course, only of a suggestive nature,
and cannot be definitely advanced as an explanation of the
observed effect. The question of the association of temperature
variations with the phenomena of haunting is one to which the
most profitable approach in the present state ofknowledge would
seem to be the experimental one.
After this review of the data collected in a prolonged investiga­
tion of the Borley Rectory case, one difficult and important
question remains— namely, to what extent do the results appear
to be inexplicable in terms of normal concepts? It is clear that
any argument for the operation at the Rectory of some para­
normal factor would, if based on this work alone, have to proceed
mainly from the auditory phenomena— that is, precisely those
events most likely to result from normal causes. Nevertheless, it
must be noted that although noises may occur naturally in many
ways, the probability that they would so accidentally happen as
to render valid all the points already discussed would seem to be
distinctly small. There appears, in fact, to be something at the
Rectory which cannot be at all easily explained away. It must
be remembered that the investigations described here form only
part of a much wider survey which has brought to light very
many mysterious phenomena.
It seems at present, therefore, that no very definite conclusions
can be reached from this work. Further elucidation o f these
problems may come with further research, and perhaps some of
G H O S T S P R E F E R C O M P A N Y 1 75
the indications we have obtained may be of some use to future
investigators.
' C om m ents 1
I will take this opportunity ofpublicly thanking Mr Robertson and
his colleagues for the time and trouble they took in carrying out this
important investigation, and in preparing the many reports of their
visits, which were sent to me on completion. These very full protocols,
with graphs, tables, sketches, and diagrams, have been deposited with
the Borley dossier in my library at the University of London. And I
must thank Mr Robertson especially for preparing such a full and
interesting summary.
Mr Robertson and his friends were at a disadvantage in many ways.
The Rectory was in ruins, and any sort of comfort was almost impos­
sible— unlike the time when my own official observers did duty there,
when we managed to establish a cosy Base Room, with firing, lighting,
hot meals, and even a bed.2 Not only was the house in ruins when the
Commission began its work, but towards the end of their labours the
house-breakers arrived and they were driven to shelter berween a few
half-demolished walls; and during the last observational period they
even had to take refuge in the summer-house! Then the Rectory had
ceased to exist: not one brick stood upon another. Now only the site
remains for future investigators.
Again, it is well known that occupied haunted houses produce more
phenomena than unoccupied ones. Ghosts— especially Poltergeists—
are fond of company. The best' periods at Borley for observing
manifestations were (a) when the Bull family, with their fourteen— or
seventeen— children were living at the Rectory; and (b) when the
Rev. L. A. Foyster and his wife, and the two infants, were occupying
the house.
A third disadvantage was the fact that the Rectory phenomena were
growing weaker, and had been for years. This is well known to those
who have studied the Borley case. More than one reader of my book
remarked upon this. For example, Mr Derek M . Hall, of229 London
Road, Reading, says (October io, 1942):
To my mind, the most interesting feature of the Borley case
from the point of view of psychical research, is the way each kind
of phenomena grew gradually weaker until it finally disappeared;
e.g.y the throwing of various objects, the bell ringing, and, most
interesting of all, the deterioration of the wall writings.
I agree. I can only suggest, as a cause, that the phenomena were

burning themselves out; that the haunt was drawing near to its
natural end, and had nearly run its course, as all haunts do— in time;
that fifteen years1investigation, by nearly two hundred people, had
frightened the 6ghosts5 away or had rendered them incapable of
manifesting themselves; or that we did, in fact, by our genuine con­
cern for the various entities, bestow upon them some measure of relief.
In the case of the 'nun5I believe this to be a fact.
M r Robertson and his colleagues were also handicapped by the
fact that their visits were too infrequent— sometimes months elapsed
between the departure of one contingent and the arrival of the next.
There was a lack of continuity which they could not avoid, owing to
their academic studies. Their university work was also responsible
for the fact that the observational groups were continually changing
in personnel: M r Robertson himself was able to be present only eight
times out of the twenty-five visits to the Rectory, owing to his duties
at Cambridge. But in spite of all the disadvantages I have named,
M r Robertson’s Commission was an outstanding success— a success
that speaks volumes for his organizing powers, and a success that has
added valuable additional evidence for the haunting ofBorley Rectory.
As for the manifestations experienced by the various groups, all had
been seen or heard before by previous investigators. They are, there­
fore, confirmatory phenomena. The 'luminous patch appearing on
the wall’ (Visit 2) was paralleled on the night o f February 16- 17,
1938, when a party o f four from Oxford (also undergraduates) visited
the Rectory. One of them, M r S. G. Welles, Rhodes Scholar of
University College, saw a Tuminous patch of light on the ceiling/ 1
which disappeared, reappeared, and slowly moved backwards and
forwards. Extensive experiments were afterwards made in an en­
deavour to reproduce the light normally, but all failed. M r Welles
says: 'None of these even remotely suggested what I felt I had seen.’3
A similar luminosity was witnessed by one of the Cambridge men
during Visit 4.
M r Robertson, who saw the luminous patch on the wall during
Visit 2, amplifies his experiences during this period in an article in
The Eagle* a magazine conducted by members of St John’s College.
He says:
At midnight (G.M .T.) we noted a rise in temperature o f two
degrees, followed again by a fall. The house remained astonishingly
silent for a long time, until^we were suddenly frightened out o f a
rather drowsy state by hearing three or four heavy, slow, and very

distinct footsteps just immediately behind the wall against which
we were leaning. With some trepidation we looked at the door,
expecting that some monstrosity might appear. But the noises
ceased, so we proceeded to investigate immediately, and on look­
ing at the region from which the noises appeared to have come I
saw quite clearly a dark shape move from the moonlight into the
shadows. But when we illuminated the whole patch o f shadow
with a red light nothing unusual could be seen.
Also during Visit 4 the familiar rumblings and furniture moving
were heard. This was a common phenomenon at Borley and else­
where, and is a true Poltergeist effect. Sir Walter Scott records1 a
similar incident at Abbotsford in 1818. He said the noise ‘ resembled
half a dozen men hard at work putting up boards and furniture.9
During Visit 6 more ‘ dragging5 noises were heard, and on another
occasion (Visit 10) was recorded: ‘ Three times rumbling, resembling
that made by a heavy piece of furniture being moved over the floor.9
Those members of the Commission who visited the Rectory on
September 22, 1942 (Visit 6), had some exceedingly interesting
experiences. The ticking o f a clock heard principally by M r J. E.
Lankester (but also by the other observers) was particularly striking
in view of the fact that his mother, many miles away, and at about
the same time, was awakened by a clock ticking in her room— in
which there was no clock. Still more striking, his mother thought of
her son at about the same time and wondered if he too was being
disturbed by the ticking of a clock. This was not coincidence. Mother
and son were en rapport, but the exciting cause is not known. Perhaps
Mrs Lankester was subconsciously fearing that her son was in some
danger in the ‘ haunted house.9
The ‘ stamping o f the horse9 outside the Rectory, on the familiar
‘ hollow road9 (Visit 9), was a common— and ancient— phenomenon
at Borley, and I have already cited examples in this book. The five
observers who heard this particular manifestation knew nothing
about the story of the ‘horses9 or ‘ coach and horses,9 so suggestion
does not enter into the question. And the fact thatfive persons heard
the ‘ horse9simultaneously proves that it was not a subjective illusion.
As M r Robertson emphasizes, this particular phenomenon, like so
many others experienced during the latter days of the Rectory’s
existence, was but a ‘ fragmentary version of the original one9
— a
shadow of its former self.
Strange noises were the chief feature of Visit 12, the truly Polter­
geist effect o f ‘ stone-throwing9 being perhaps an echo of the many

- 18. Many similar incidents are recorded
in this book.

stones that were actually thrown during the palmy days of the
haunting.
The steady drop in temperature (Visit 14) measured on the £co!d
spot5 is confirmatory evidence of the fact that several people have
become suddenly cold at this particular point outside the Blue Room
—a point exactly over a curious subsidence in the cellar, where we
discovered the ancient foundations of a previous building on the
Rectory site. Excavations were made at this subsidence, in the hope
of finding something that might account for the lowered temperature,
but we discovered nothing. The experiments during Visit 14 at least
proved that the 4coldness5experienced by observers at this point was
in fact physical and not merely physiological. During Visit 11 there
was also a csteadyfall in temperature.5 During the night ofJune 19-20
there was also experienced a £subclinically fruity smell,5reminiscent
of many such smells (lavender, incense, etc.) recorded by observers
at the Rectory at various times. And it will be remembered that Mr
Medcraft noticed a £strong but pleasant aroma5that reminded him
of flowers.
Finally, on the night of April 30, 1944 (Visit 22), the Cambridge
observers saw the ‘light5in Bedrooms 1 and 2 (see Plan III). It was
this particular phenomenon that took me to the Rectory, on my first
visit, on June 12, 1929. The light had been seen in Room 7, in the
older part of the building. I did not see it myself, but several people
did, intermittently, including Mr V. C. Wall, the Daily Mirror1
representative. A similar phenomenon was also recorded by the Rev.
G. E. Smith and his wife; by Herbert Mayes, the Hennings5chauffeur,
and by their maid; by Mr and Mrs Basil Payne, of Borley Place, a
house nearly opposite the Rectory; and by many villagers. This elight
in the bedroom,5and the raps that appeared to come from the back
of the mirror in the Blue Room, were the first phenomena that I
recorded in the Borley dossier, on June 12, 1929. It is curious that
among the last entries in the annals of Borley Rectory should be
included the ‘light5and the raps heard in the summer-house (Visit
25). This may seem strange, but everything connected with Borley
is strange.

D e a r Sir ,
I hope it will not bore you to read this effort o f mine to cdiagnose

interesting book over the Christmas holiday, and this is the fruit

, etc., no doubt, but even if I am on the wrong
track no harm will be done. Normally, it would seem pretty hope­
less to look for ‘ clues5in a case of this kind, though I have had a
healthy respect for psychical research (proper) ever since I read
Myers5Human Personality1years ago. But here, though it is impos­
sible to say how the phenomena occurred, thanks to you we can

be sure that they did occur: and it seems to me, therefore, that we
are entirely justified in asking the question, cWhy did they occur?’
If the same or similar conclusions have already been reached by
you it may at least be of some interest that I have arrived at them
independently. If they have not, and you think there is something
in them, I should value your comments. I would only add that
this is not a jeu d'esprit. It seems to me that (again thanks to you)
we have here for the first time (so far as I know, but my knowledge
o f the subject is mediocre) the possibility o f testing the evidential
value of certain of these phenomena. If this is so it would be a great
pity to leave the case where it stands. There are at least two lines
o f further investigation which can be followed up, and if they con­
firmed my conclusions it would be a striking triumph for psychical
research.
Yours very truly,

T h e B o r l e y H a u n t
The phenomena collected and recorded by M r H arry Price
in his book on Borley R ectory1 strongly suggest that we have
here a genuine ‘ haunt.9 T he focus o f their activity, in other
words, would seem to be a crime o f a peculiarly distressing nature,
which has 'im pregnated5 the spot with the thoughts (and some
o f the actions) o f the victim s: and the stirring up o f the ground
by the building o f the new R ectory and the presence in it o f its
living occupants have com bined to release a new and powerful
outpouring o f this inexplicable psychic energy. Let us at any
rate make this assumption, to w hich I would add another: this
is, that the objects brought specially to the notice o f the investi­
gators, more particularly the 'apports,5 were intended (no
matter by w h om !) to assist their work as clues o f a general nature
and can be relied upon on this understanding. For example, the
'strange coat9 apport is meant to indicate that the victim was a
wom an, but not that she was the actual owner o f the coat. Simi­
larly, the gilt Confirmation medallion (p. 59) means that she was
a R om an Catholic, but not that the m edallion belonged to her.
(It may also suggest that she was a young R om an C atholic.)
O nce again the French Revolution badge (p. 59) signifies that
she was a French woman, but not that she lived necessarily in
1The Most Haunted House in England.

written by Mrs Foyster and Kerr-Pearse
respectively.

the eighteenth century. These objects, I take it, were picked up
(somewhere) as being the nearest approximation to the truth
that were available: they are clues, but rough clues. At any rate,
if'we make use of this assumption we get some decidedly interest­
ing results.
Let us begin, then, with the victim, about whom we already
seem to have gathered some information. She was a young (?)
French Roman Catholic, a fact confirmed by two further pieces
of evidence provided on the spot First, there is the wall-writing
appeal for clight Mass and prayers' (I suggest that ‘ light' here
is an adjective qualifying both ‘ Mass' and ‘ prayers,’ and that it
refers to the prayer used both privately and at Requiems, ‘ Let
light perpetual shine upon them '). By itself, of course, this
merely shows that the victim was not an Anglican in the post-
Reformation sense of the word, since we can leave ‘ Anglo-
Catholicism' out ofcount here altogether. But then in the second
place there is the apparition of the ‘ Nun’ or ‘ Sister of M ercy.’
Now it seems always to have been taken for granted that this
apparition must belong to pre-Reformation times, and a con­
venient ‘ monk' has therefore been invented by legend to account
for the tragedy. But, of course, the apparition by itself gives us
no indication of its date, and if we link it with the appearance of
the coach, for which the ‘ Nun’ seems to have been constantly on
the watch by the roadside (pp. 56-58), a pre-Reformation date
(as M r Price points out) is definitely excluded. On the other
hand, if these two phenomena are to be combined (and it seems
clear that they must be), and if we tie up with them the appear­
ance of the little old man (pp. 49, 54) who seems to have been
the gardener Amos (lived in seventeenth century?); and if we
add to this again our previous evidence that the victim was
French, we arrive at a very different conclusion. Then we have a
French woman {probablyyoung) who has been brought to Englandfrom
a French convent at some date in the seventeenth or eighteenth centuries.
Now this conclusion is strikingly corroborated by the Plan-
chette replies given to Miss Glanville, first alone and afterwards
with M r Glanville and Mr Kerr-Pearse. Normally one would
not take much notice of this mode of divination, which is
182 t h e e n d of b o r l e y r e c t o r y
justifiably suspected of reflecting the thoughts of its users. But
in this case it will be noted (p. 160) not only th atcMarianne5was
called upon before any question was asked, but (what is still
more remarkable) that the replies subsequently given persisted
steadily in ignoring the legendary story of the ‘ monk5and Bures
‘ nunnery.5 Whenever leading questions on either of these were
put the answers were almost invariably indistinct, absent, or
obviously irrelevant, a fact which was quickly recognized by the
questioner. Discounting, then, those occasions on which a simple
(and meaningless) cYes5 was returned to such inquiries, we are
left with the quite explicit statement that the victim was a Mary
Lairre (La Irre?), a French girl of nineteen years of age, who
was a novice in a nunnery at Havre (first written Haiv), and
was murdered (strangled) by ‘ Waldegrave5 on May 17, 1667.
Our previous conclusion about the victim being thus abun­
dantly confirmed by Planchette, we may reasonably be more
disposed to trust this source in what it has to tell us about the
murder and its perpetrator. Again it will be noticed that the
questioner was still pursuing the mythical ‘ Fadenoch5or ‘ Father
Enoch5 (p. 161), and that no one up to this time appears to have
thought of the family which ‘ played a major part in Borley
during some three hundred years5 from the beginning of the
fifteenth century (p. 13). But now the name ‘ Waldegrave5
comes out at us, like a bolt from the blue; and remembering the
odd disturbance of the coffins in the crypt of Borley Church
(p. 50; it is not, of course, said that they were Waldegrave coffins
but the probability is considerable), we have good grounds for
following up this accusation. W e return, then, to Borley itself
to see whether any clue has been provided there which would
point us to the same quarter. Unmistakably, I believe, we find
that such a clue has been given, namely the ‘ touchwood5 apport
‘ roughly three feet square,5which was found by M r Kerr-Pearse
on the hearth of the sewing-room (p. 206) and which was later
psychometrized by ‘ Marion5 (p. 138). ‘ Marion’s5 evidence is
admittedly confused and not easy to disentangle: nevertheless it
can be made, I think, to yield some very interesting hints, This
piece of wood seems to have been either a part of a relic (or
' m a r i o n ’ s 5 p s y c h o m e t r y 183
treasure5) or (as I think more probable) part of a box which
once contained a relic (or ‘ treasure’ ) which was brought from
‘ another continent’ and later ‘ wandered about.5 ‘ It w ent/ so
‘ M arion5 says, ‘ to different places. I do not know which place
to say at the outset, or how to describe the sort of country. It is
a sort of old-fashioned building with small buildings adjoining.
A small island.5 Immediately one thinks of Iona, the sanctuary-
home of St Columba, or ofHoly Island, the refuge of St Guthbert,
to either of which such a relic might well have been brought
from ‘ another continent.5 Certainly the description cannot
possibly be that of Borley.
But now comes a most incongruous statement. ‘ There is no
peace or rest. There is a sort of feud or quarrel between two
families— two sorts of ideas. They are not enemies, but have a
quarrel between each other, not for something but for ideas or
ideals. . . . Their lives did not touch.5 Now all this is patently
inapplicable to such an abode of peace and rest as the ‘ small
island/ ‘ without any surroundings.5 W e conclude, therefore,
that the scene has shifted. After circling about to decide where
he was to start ‘ Marion5 chose a spot in this part of the world
rather than in that ‘ other continent5where he might have begun,
but, having described this spot, he sees the picture dissolve into
one of people ‘ coming and going.5 The scene has shifted— and
the date. For, of course, his new picture is easily recognizable.
What he is describing now is the turbulent chaos of the Reforma­
tion, when men were ‘ enemies/ but not in the normal sense, and
‘ ideas or ideals/ not material ambitions, divided them. Now in
such a time as this, where would a sacred relic or ‘ treasure5find
refuge? Obviously, with those who were loyal to the ‘ Old
Religion/ and since it was not they but their enemies who gained
the ascendant, their lot was doomed to be one of frustration and
unhappiness. And this is precisely what ‘ M arion5 goes on to
say. ‘ One of the last owners [of the relic or ‘ treasure5] was a
very tall man. . . . He was a public man who played a big part
in public life. . . . He died a lonely man . . . disappointed with
life and his work.5 And later, when ‘ M arion5 had been told for
the first time about Borley Church and its history, he added that
184 t h e e n d of b o r l e y r e c t o r y
the apport had *a general association with a church. But people
in the Church were enemies to him '
Now all this as it stands is, of course, quite general and vague.
But if we remember that the apport came from the site of—or
near— the old Waldegrave manor of Borley; that the Walde-
graves were Papists and therefore enemies of ‘ people in the
Church5; and that one of them, Sir Edward, after being M .P.
and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, actually died as a
prisoner in the Tower for loyalty to the ‘ old Religion,5the state­
ments of ‘ Marion5at once assume a new significance. (W e may
note also in passing the legend of the lost ‘ treasure5 of Borley
[p. 51] and the ‘ perfect drawing of a chalice5 produced during
the Planchette experiments.) It is indeed hardly too much to
say that ‘ Marion5 seems to have been describing Sir Edward
himself! But, if this is so, then the significance of the apport clue
is simultaneously and most clearly revealed. Like all other clues,
its indication is only a rough one. It does not point to any one
particular member of the Waldegrave family, but it does most
loudly and distinctly say ‘ Waldegrave5
— and this is just what
Planchette also said!
Putting all these hints together, we seem now in a position
to construct a general picture of the tragedy which underlies
them. It is indeed not an unfamiliar story which gradually
comes to light, and though the details necessarily escape us, the
main events in it seem only too clear. We see a young Walde­
grave on his travels welcomed by his co-religionists abroad,
becoming infatuated with the young French novice with whom
he contrives clandestine meetings, carrying her off, marrying
her (the ‘ wedding-ring5 apport is of great importance here),
bringing her home to England and settling her, perhaps in
secrecy, in the old, remote family manor of Borley. (The seat
of the family proper was at Chewton, in Somerset.) After this
the story develops on all too familiar lines. The husband departs,
leaving his young French bride, a foreigner among strange faces,
marooned in an empty countryside and watching and waiting
only for his return. (How often did she walk that path of hers,
how often stand by the road in hopeless grief?) But when he
‘ y o u n g i n n o c e n c e b e t r a y e d 3 185
does return, when at last that long-expected coach swings round
the bend, he comes back not as a loving husband but as a pitiless
enemy, resolved to remove the barrier which he finds now
between him and a more Suitable5 or profitable marriage.
Melodrama? Perhaps. But somehow I have the feeling that this
haunting of Borley cannot so easily be brushed aside. Deep in
this fantastic record there is a poignant agony, neither lightly
caused nor, as it would appear, lightly solaced; an agony not of
remorse, but of young innocence, foully betrayed and murdered,
So much then for the crime and for its perpetrator, whom I
think we can reasonably identify with the ‘ tall dark man5 seen
once by Miss Ethel Bull (p. 46). The question then arises, what
did he do with the body? Ostensibly, one presumes, the myste­
rious young foreigner who had lived so long by herself at the
Manor would have been given out as having departed in that
midnight coach. (Perhaps cold Am os,5 if he was alive then,
might have had his doubts, but there would be no one to contra­
dict the story.) In actual fact, however, it may be taken as
certain that she never left the manor, alive or dead: she was
murdered and buried on the spot. But where? In the garden?
This was the answer made both by Planchette and in M r
Glanville’s table-turning experiments, but it was an answer too
readily given to satisfy the questioner (see p. 160), and it conflicts
with the essential fact that the focus of the haunt was in the house
and seems to have emanated (to judge from the position of the
ccold spot5
) from the cellar. Have we any evidence which bears
out this more probable conclusion? I think we have. The first
clue (there are at least two, to my mind) is found in the wall-
writing which M r Price reads as cMarianne At Get Help—
Entant Bottom M e,5 which is of course meaningless as it stands,
But after scrutinizing the excellent photograph of this writing
(Plate V I) [ and Plate IX of present volume] very carefully I am
convinced that this reading can be improved. The 6Marianne5
is well and distinctly written, but the three (or if we include a
single word, four) lines which follow below it, one beneath the
other, are partly superimposed as if by some one writing in
semi-darkness, and are therefore not easily deciphered. First,
l 8 6 T H E E N D OF B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
immediately under the ‘ ri’ of ‘ Marianne’ there seems to have
been an abortive attempt to write ‘ get’ (M r Price’s ‘ A t’ ). Then
the writer started again below, a little farther to the left, and
wrote quite plainly: ‘ Get help.’ After this the writing begins
again still farther, but not much, below, and still farther to the
left; and the first letter seems evidently to be a ‘ W .’ But then
the writer found that if the word was continued along this level
it would run into the ‘ Get help’ just above it; so without being
removed from the wall, the pencil described a sort of reversed
S curve, first upward and outward to complete the right-hand
upright of the ‘ W ,’ then downward and once more upward to
form the next letter on the new lower leoel. This latter is quite clearly
an e, and it is followed by two very sharply pointed ‘ peaks’
which may be read either as an inclined n or as a double t (as
in ‘ bottom’ just below, though there, one at least of the f’s is
probably crossed) or as a double l. After this there is a blank
interval, and then, pretty clearly, the letters t, a, and n, the last
finishing with a strong upward stroke with a curious kind of
double loop near the bottom on its left-hand side but with the last
stroke crossing it to the right. M r Price reads this last letter as
a t, but this reading does not take into account the odd convolu­
tions near its base. It looks, in fact, as if the writer were trying
to form a somewhat less usual letter, but made a mess of it for
some reason unknown to us. I suggest that this letter is a bungled
(reversed) A:. The message then reads: ‘ Marianne, Get Help . . .
W e ll. . . Tank . . . Bottom me. ’
Now this reading, which I arrived at before I had read the
end of the book, is very strikingly corroborated on later pages. I
was, of course, already aware that there were two wells on the
premises of the Rectory, one in the cellar and the other in the
covered passage of the new wing. What I was not prepared to
hear was that the former, being investigated by M r Kerr-Pearse,
turned out to be a ‘ tank,’ though ‘ at one time it was a deep well,
and wasfilled info r safetys sake5 (p. 207). This is odd enough, but
what makes the matter still more curious is Captain Gregson’s
story of the heavy hatch-cover which he put over this well or
tank but which was found to have been thrown off it ‘ some
‘ m a r i e 5 w r i t e s i n f r e n c h 187
distance away’ (p. 171); and to this phenomenon we may add
the apport clue of the dry, flat, and dusty petrified frog (p. 207)
which suggests a ‘ place-once-wet-but-now-filled-in,3 if one may
use this ‘ holophrase.5 One would much like to know who first
filled in this well, and whose ‘ safety’ was at stake when it was
filled in ! For obviously, if you want a ‘ safe5 place for the corpse
of your victim, such a well (assuming you have two) can hardly
be bettered. All you have then to do is to proclaim it dangerous
and seal up for ever the evidence of your guilt ! (I wonder, by
the way, whether the ‘ lumps of stone’ apports [pp. 63-64] may
not have been designed as pointers to this filling-up of the well.
Did they and the glass with them actually come out ofthe ‘ tank’ ?)
I come now to the message which appeared on the wall after
Mrs Foyster had written her request for more information
(p. 146 and Plate V I). M r Price reads this as ‘ Light in . . .
Write Prayer and O . . . but I think that a close examination
discloses something of much greater interest. To begin with,
there seems to be no doubt that the word after ‘ light5 is the
French word ‘ trompée’1 (the accent slightly misplaced to the
left) written in an easy and flowing hand. Indeed, I am inclined
to call it the best-written word in all these messages, for the
English letters, where they are most distinct, have a stiff copy­
book air about them. I am not a spiritualist, and I make no
attempt to explain this phenomenon, but the impression given is
certainly that of a Frenchwoman (note the feminine termination)
breaking into her own language to protest that she is the victim
of a cruel deception. Be that as it may, however, the appearance
of this French word gives us, I believe, a valuable clue to the
decipherment of the rest of the message. For it is hardly likely
that it stands alone, and if it does not it is reasonable to suppose
that the message is in two parts, the one in English and the other
in French. But if there is such a division where does it come
and how is it marked? The answer, as I hope to show, is to be
found in the line drawn diagonally downwards from near to
the top of the t in ‘ trompée’ to the middle of the d in ‘ and.5
To the left of this,.downward^ we have the familiar appeal for
1From the French verb tromper, to deceive, cheat, dupe.—H. P.
l8 8 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
' light mass* (requiem), etc., to the right of it a response to
Marianne’s request for more information. Let us take these
two in turn.
(¿) The word under Tight* begins with an unmistakable M
(capital), and this is followed by three 'peaks,5 the first two
irregularly inclined to the left, the third making a vertical loop
above the up-stroke of the d in 'a n d .5 As it stands, this is, of
course, meaningless, but since the whole word is a mere scrawl,
it is not too much to assume that the second letter is a bungled
a and the last two s. The writer seems to have realized that the
pencil had got out of control on this line, with the result that
the 'an d 5which follows in line 3 is scrupulously and even pain­
fully formed I And there this part of the message ends, as I
believe; and I suggest that it remained unfinished because it
occurred to the writer that Marianne had already received this
request for 'Light Mass and [Prayers]5 and had asked for some­
thing new. This part of the message was therefore abruptly
broken off, and a new start made on line 1.
(ii) The new message begins, as we have seen, with the word
'trom pée/ and a most revealing word it is! For, claiming as it
does to come from the victim, it protests her innocence of any
heinous sin and thereby denies indirectly the guilty-nun legend
which Marianne (in common with others) had presumably got
well fbced in her mind! Here, in fact, is something o f that
'm ore5 for which she had asked!
What, then, of the rest of the message? Unfortunately line 2
is very hard to decipher, but I think the first three letters are
clearly R (capital), é (with accent), and p. The p is very oddly
made, for it has a long vertical loop (instead of the horizontal
loop in 'trompée5) which looks at first sight like an L I believe,
however, that it is simply a 'squiggle/ since it overlies the main
loop of the p instead of forming a separate letter on its right.
Possibly the pencil slipped, for at this point the writing runs over
a thumb-print, which I imagine was on the wall before the
message was written (unless I altogether mistake the care and
skill of M r Price’s investigators !)A Certainly the grease of this
1It was there when I rented the Rectory.— H. P.
‘ r é p o n d i c i 5 189
print has affected the 0 in ‘ trom pée/ and it is also responsible,
I make no doubt, for the illegibility of the next two letters. All
I can suggest about these (for the moment) is that the second
seems to be a badly formed n. It is followed by a much more
distinct letter which looks like an 0, but is finished off with a
stroke drawn upward to the right across its lower half. I think
it is meant to be a d, but if so it has been very rapidly written
or rather scrawled. This stroke carries the writing right up into
the line above, but what follows can be disentangled without
any very great difficulty. Pretty obviously it is a new word which
begins here, and I read it confidently as 4ici.3 The C is very
large in proportion to the other letters, but this is probably
because, while its top is more or less level with the first its tail
falls back to the level of line 2, at which level the rest of the word
is continued.
W e have now considered the whole of this line with the excep­
tion of a kidney-shaped oval which cuts the bottom of the t in
‘ trompée3
, surrounds the e in line 2, and finishes level with the
bottom of line 3. It is with the ‘ and3 in this line that M r Price
connects it, and it is certainly possible that it is the initial letter
of a word which was never finished. Personally I doubt this,
for we should expect it in that case to be a P ; nor does its appear­
ance of a deflated 0 consist well with the careful writing of the
‘ and3 in front of it. I suspect that it was a scrawl made before
the message was written, and that it may have nothing to do
with that phenomenon at all. Excluding this, then, we may read
line 2 of this part of the message cRépxn(?)d(?) ici.3 Now one
of the letters in the first of these words is definitely indecipher­
able and two more are uncertain, so that it may seem hardly
worthwhile to attempt a reconstruction. At the same time I must
point out that the number of possible French words beginning
with ‘ R ép3is not a large one, and that these three letters appear
to be quite distinct. For this reason I make bold to suggest that
what the writer meant to say was ‘ Répond ici,3 which would
make excellent sense. Marianne had asked to be told more,
and this had been done in the one word ‘ trompée.3 No doubt
the writer would have added further information, but it looks
i g O T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
as if the power available (whatever it was) was extremely limited
as well as fluctuating in intensity. (Contrast the scrawled ‘ Mass5
between the two well-written words ‘ Light,5 ‘ A nd.5) All that
could be done, then, was to scribble an appeal to Marianne to
carry on her questioning by the method which she had already
begun to use— i.e.> by writing a new question on the wall
(cici5). This question, which would itself have been an answer
(‘ Répond5) to the writer’s ‘ trompée,5would naturally have been
‘ By whom?5 Whether it would have been answered is another
matter, but unfortunately by this time Mrs Foyster was no
longer living at the Rectory.

One word may be said in conclusion on aspects of this case
which have not been mentioned. The phenomena apparently
connected with the Rev. Harry Bull were no doubt due to his
absorbing interest in the haunt when he was alive. That interest
was, as it were, sucked into the vortex of psychic energy which
revolved round the crime, and even activities like ‘ old Amos5
and the garden bonfire1 appear to have shared the same fate
1 the ‘ smoke on the lawn* phenomenon. (See pp. i io- i 11.)— H.P.
BORLEY CRIME AT ROOT OF TROUBLE igi
(p. 202). The more familiar Poltergeist ‘ goings-on’ hardly need
comment, for they have so many parallels that we cannot regard
them as illuminating this particular haunt. It seems, too, pretty
clear that Mrs Foyster was a strong ‘ Poltergeist-focus9 and that
she was responsible (of course, unconsciously) for the violence of
the phenomena during her residence at the Rectory. I have
wondered incidentally, while reading this book, whether she
had herself at one time been a Papist (French Canadian?). I f
that were so it would account for the appeals being directed to
her, quite apart from her being psychic. I would suggest, how­
ever, that all these are details of secondary importance which
must not be allowed to muddle the main issue. Through all
this hugger-mugger of bumps, thuds, cracks, clicks, shuffling and
padding footsteps, and the rest, one must keep clearly in view
the one underlying Jons et origo of them all, the crime which
began with a peculiarly heartless desertion and ended in a
peculiarly atrocious murder. For I think it will be agreed that,
if our reconstruction of this horror comes anywhere near the
truth, there is no need to look further for an explanation of the
Borley haunt.

Notes1
As some of Dr Phythian-Adams’s references may seem obscure to
those readers not in possession of my first monograph, it will be as
well to elucidate certain points. The Canon purposely used the origi­
nal pagination, assuming that The Most Haunted House in England
would be available.
I have already referred to the ‘ strange coat’ (Chapter I), which
needs no further mention here. As for ‘ old Amos,’ this ‘ character’ is
traditional in the Bull family, and his idiosyncrasies are well remem-
bered. I was informed that he flourished in the seventeenth century,
as the Canon suggests.
‘ Marion’ (i.e.3 Josef Kraus) is a Czechoslovak vaudeville tele­
pathist and psychometrist,2 possessing some extraordinary faculties
which, however, may not be paranormal. He was under test in my
laboratory for some years, and we were impressed with his work. He

IQ2 THE END OF BORLEY RECTORY
psychometrized1 the piece of touchwood that suddenly appeared
during one of Mr Kerr-Pearse5
s observational periods, with interest­
ing results, as Canon Phythian-Adams points out.
The ‘chalice5was part of the Borley Church plate that disappeared
many years ago, and attempts have been made to find it. An excel­
lent "drawing of a chalice appeared on one of the Planchette scripts
in answer to a question. The ‘wedding-ring5apport was the one that
Mr Motion and I found on the floor of the Blue Room on the last day
of my tenancy of the Rectory. A similar wedding-ring apport also
suddenly appeared at the Rectory some years previously, during the
Foysters5 occupation of the house.
Dr Phythian-Adams5
s interpretation of the wall-writings is in­
genious and, I am convinced, correct. His experience in deciphering
inscriptions, and his archaeological excavations at Jerusalem, in
Northern Syria, the Sudan, Palestine, and elsewhere, obviously
fitted him for the task of unravelling the Borley 4hieroglyphics.5
What I cannot understand is why every one— including myself—
missed the French ‘ trompee, 5which, as the Canon points out, is the
plainest word (with the exception of ‘ Marianne5
) inscribed on the
Rectory walls. (See Plate IX.)
A week or so after Dr Phythian-Adams sent me his essay he re­
examined the wall-writing photographs and came to the conclusion
that the message: ‘ Marianne, Get Help . . . Well . . . Tank . . .
Bottom me5should read: ‘ Marianne Get Help. Well. . . Tank . . .
Bottom me.5 It is only the question of a comma, but the sense of the
appeal is altered and is now more logical. The reason why we origi­
nally read it as: ‘ Marianne— at— get— Help— Entant—Bottom— M e5
was that we concluded that the writer was trying to convey the fact
that she was ‘ repentant.5 However, as the Borley story gradually
unfolds, it is obvious that ‘ Mary Lairre5had nothing to repent of. I
am sorry that she did not sign the messages.
In another letter the Canon suggests that young Waldegrave may
only have filled in the ‘well-tank5 partially; or, if he were leaving
Borley, may not have filled it in at all. He says:
I raise this point aftersubsequent reflection, because I have begun
to wonder whether that young woman's skull (found in the library
cupboard by the wife of the Rev. G. E. Smith) may not have come
from the well. Here again I think it would be most valuable to
find out if any of the Bulls remember it being filled in.
No one remembers the wells being filled in (the ‘ tank5completely,
and the round one partially), and no one now knows anything about
the skull.
1See myfirst monograph, pp. 137-138.
I93
THE SKULL A ^POINTER5?
In a further note the Canon says:
One wonders what was the provenance of this skull. Was it
found during the excavations on the site of the new Rectory, and
if so, where? Who made a parcel of it? (A woman in all proba­
bility, on account of the neatness—perhaps Mrs Henry Bull?)
And why was it not buried at the time of its discovery? It is most
unfortunate that we have apparently no answer to these questions,
but I think we may take it as highly probable that the skull was
discovered either in the cellar well (before it was made a tank) or
in the cellar subsidence below the 6cold spot.9 It may very well
have been kept in the expectation that other parts of the skeleton
would be found later, when all of them could have been interred
together; and that it was afterwards forgotten. But if the Misses
Bull have no remembrance of it this incident may be one more
paranormality at Borley Rectory, and we must add the skull to our
list o f‘ apport9clues.
I agree with all that Canon Phythian-Adams says in support of his
argument that the French medallions, the wedding-ring, the ‘ strange
coat,9 etc. were ‘ apports5 sent as ‘ pointers9 to indicate either what
we were to look for; to put us on the right road to a solution of the
mystery; or to explain to us what we had already found. If this
assumption is correct then the ‘ skull in the cupboard9 might be a
pointer to the skull in the ‘ well-tank9
—where we actually found a
small portion of a woman’s skull.
In a letter to me (December 20, 1942) Canon Phythian-Adams
makes some further suggestions about Mr Kerr-Pearse’s ‘ touchwood
apport.9 He says:
In my analysis I mentioned Iona and Holy Island as the kind of
‘ small island9 that ‘ Marion9 psychometrized; but the difficulty
then was that he seemed to break off and start on the new topic
of the Reformation. But suppose the ‘ small island9were the ‘ Isle
of Avalon,9
1 the holiest place in England (as it was thought)? I
don’t know the history of Glastonbury, but I suppose it was des­
troyed in Edward V i’s reign, if not in Henry V III’s. Could the
monks have given a relic to the Waldegrave family for safe keeping?
Was that why Mary rewarded Sir Edward Waldegrave with
Chewton [the principal home of the Waldegraves], which is on
the Mendips not far from Glastonbury?
I do not want to be sensational (which the Planchette ‘ chalice9
might lead one to be), so I will not suggest that this relic was the
1Avalon, inWelshmythology, the ‘KingdomoftheDead,’ afterwardsanearthly
paradise inthew
esternseas, and, finally, theabode ofheroes towhichKing Arthur

Grail i1 But it does seem to me that here is a clue worth following
up. Who knows? That too may have gone down the well and be
waiting for you!
The Canon’s last remark was prophetic. We did not find the
chalice or the Holy Grail, but we didfind in the round well a Sheffield-
plate cream-jug (Plate X V I ) ! Is this still another ‘ indicator5point­
ing to— what? As the Canon remarks in another letter, it is a fascinat­
ing business!
I am sure that my readers are grateful— as I am— for all the time,
ingenuity, skill, and work that Canon Phythian-Adams has devoted to
the Borley case. His discoveries and suggestions have proved invalu­
able, and it is due to these that I ultimately decided to arrange for the
excavating of the cellar wells at Borley Rectory. What we found
there will emerge later.
1 The Holy Grail is the famous talisman of Arthurian romance, the object of quest
on the part of the Knights of the Round Table. In Sir Thomas Malory’s translation
of the French Q uite du Saint Graal, it is the cup or chalice of the Last Supper, in which
the blood which flowed from the wounds of the crucified Saviour has been miracu­
lously preserved.— H. P.
CHAPTER XI
DECIPHERING THE MARIANNE APPEALS
LLEGED paranormal wall-writing by psychic ‘ entities’
occurs very rarely in houses haunted by either ghosts or
Poltergeists, but this phenomenon at Borley Rectory was not
unique. In the Poltergeist infestation at Amherst, Nova Scotia,
in 1878-79, Esther Cox, the young girl ‘ medium’ or centre of
attraction, was threatened several times in ‘ messages.’ One of
these, scribbled on the bedroom wall, read: ‘ Esther Cox, you
are mine to kill! ’ It nearly frightened the life out of her.1 In
a case at Battersea that I investigated in 1928 a house was
infested by another Poltergeist, and slips of paper, bearing
‘ messages,’ were found scattered about the rooms. One of these
read: ‘ I am having a bad time here. I cannot rest. I was bom
during the reign of William the Conqueror. Tom Blood.’
Others were signed ‘Jessie Blood.’ A frill description of the case
can be found in my book2 on Poltergeists. The Berkeley Square
ghost is alleged also to have written on walls.3
For a full account of the Borley wall-messages, the reader
should consult my previous monograph,4 where the writings are
analysed and discussed in detail. The messages were all of a
pathetic nature, with ‘ Help, Mass, Prayers, and Incense’ as the
main theme. All have a Roman Catholic flavour; all were
addressed to ‘ Marianne’ (i.e., Mrs Foyster); and all appeared
during the incumbency of the Rev. L. A. Foyster, who mentions
the appeals in his diary. Under date of May 1931, he records
messages, ‘ written in a childish hand,’ addressed to Marianne.
None, apparently, was signed. Though the wall-writings were
in existence during my tenancy of the Rectory, when they were

photographed, I never saw any of the messages that were written
on paper.1 Where the principal appeals appeared can be seen
from the plans of the Rectory, included in this volume.
Although no ‘ messages3 were written during my lease of the
Rectory, many new pencil-markings were noted by my observers
— some of them appearing spontaneously in their presence. And
though we received no messages on the malls, the Glanville family
and their friends recorded many of these pathetic appeals via
the Planchette and the tipping table, as the reader knows. They
are all in the same vein: ‘ Light, Mass, Prayers,3 etc.
We have seen how the skill of Dr Phythian-Adams has made
sense out of the principal writings, and how his discovery of the
words ‘ trompée,3 etc., is confirmation of ‘ Mary LairreV own
Planchette assertion that she was French. Other correspondents3
attempts to disentangle the cryptic appeals may be of interest
to the reader, and I now propose to submit a few of them. The
photographs of the writings, reproduced herewith, should be
carefully studied.
The Rev. F. A. Heaton, of St MichaePs Vicarage, Tenterden,
Kent, sends me (January 25, 1941) some interesting suggestions.
He says:
What I would like to suggest to you is concerning the writings.
. . . They strike me as being written by some one either (a) when
they were not looking at what they were doing; or (b) in the dark.
The reason is the way the letters are all joined in one continuous
line, as if the person could not take the pencil off lest they should
put it down to continue in the wrong place. If I could really believe
that unhappy spirits could make their needs known, I should
imagine that some one was imprisoned ‘in the dark,3and perhaps
died there. Hence the crying for ‘ light.3 In the picture opposite
p. 152 [the ‘ w ell-tank9and ‘ trompée3messages], the writer could not
see and did get muddled, hence the writing over writing. By the
way, the one you read as ‘Marianne-at-Get-Help-entant-Bottom-
Me% I could imagine to be .. Bottom-We.3 That is, the bottom
well. The line of the e, leading up like it does, suggests another
letter to follow. The message below I could imagine really is ‘ and
open,3 not ‘and O.3 And the odd marks on p. 147, when turned

ChapterXXII and Plate XXVI.)

upside down, are very near looking like ‘ light' again. And the bottom
word ofall reminds me very much ofancient script, with the delight
they seemed to take in 1flourishes.’ There is no such usage as ‘light
Mass,’ though there is, of course, Tow Mass.’
Mr Heaton’s remark about the inverted word Tight’ refers to
the ‘ message’ that appeared near the Blue Room on June 16,
1931. A tracing of this message is reproduced at p. 197 here­
with. The word is immediately below ‘ Here,’ If the reader
turns the page upside down he will see that the ‘ odd marks’ do
resemble ‘ light.'
Mr H . E. Adshead, J.P., B.A., of Beslyns, Great Bardfield,
Braintree, Essex, also thought that the ‘ odd marks’ were the
inverted word ‘ light.’
Canon A . W . Stote-Blandy, Vicar of Golehill and Canon of
Sarum, writing from Wimbome, Dorset, also draws my atten­
tion to the ‘ odd marks’ referred to by M r Heaton. He thinks
that they may stand for ‘ Finis. ’ He continues (January 27,1941):
‘ But beneath this, and between the horizontal lines, I think I
can read “ AtofM ass]” “ by self,” which seems to make sense if
Mary Lairre felt the need of a Mass for her own repose! ’
Miss Camilla Doyle, a draughtsman, of 46 The Close,
Norwich, also writes (April 2, 1941) to say that she has inter­
preted the ‘ Well-Tank-Bottom-Me’ message (just as Canon
Phythian-Adams did a couple of months previously), and sends
me an excellent tracing (reproduced) of it.
NEW INTERPRETATION O
F A M
ARIANNE ‘ M
ESSAG
E’
Mr H . E. Beal, of St Peter’s Hill, Caversham, Berks, is certain
(May 7, 1941) that the bottom line of the ‘ odd marks’ message,
referred to by M r Heaton (see tracing at p. 197), is in Devanagari
(manuscript, not printed) characters, one of the Indo-Aryan
‘ r o m a n b r e v i a r y p r a y e r s 5? 199
languages, and that a competent Sanskrit scholar could decipher
them. So far I have been unable to find one who can understand
the symbols. Perhaps one of my readers will oblige.
Emeritus Professor W . B. Stevenson, D.Litt., D .D ., L L .D ., etc.,
writing from 31 Mansionhouse Road, Edinburgh, sends me
(September 9, 1941) some interesting suggestions concerning the
wall-writings. H e says that he does not know the expression
4light M ass,5 and supposes that 'light,5 'M ass,5 and 'prayers5
are separate items. The 'light5might be for a search somewhere,
or might be figurative. In the principal message (Plate IX),
between the words 'M arianne5 and 'G et help,5 he detects two
crosses. He, too, discovered the ' W ell-Tank-Bottom-M e5 inter­
pretation in this appeal. In the 'odd marks5 message (p. 197),
Professor Stevenson suggests that the top line might read: ' Get-
Light-Mass-R.B.-Prayers,5the' R .B .5(meaning Roman Breviary)
taking the place of my 'an d .5 It would thus mean, 'Rom an
Breviary Prayers,5not' and prayers.5 The Professor draws atten­
tion to the fact thatcIt is perhaps significant that all the messages
occur at one side of the house, within reach of a common centre.5
The ' Prince of Wales’s Feathers’ markings1that appeared during
the actual presence of M r M . Savage, a B.B.G. television
engineer, may be, says Professor Stevenson, an attempt to repre­
sent a Jleur de lis— emphasizing the French nationality of the
communicator.
M r Edward P. Smith, ofRysings, Stone-in-Oxney, Tenterden,
Kent, has some novel suggestions to make. He says (July 30,
Two points impress me: (¿z) Y ou speak of the pencillings as being
eleft-handed.5 To me they suggest, most forcibly, writing which is
the result of somebody or something using the pencil (or whatever
was employed) between the teeth. I knew a man once who lost the use
of his arms and wrote with a pencil or paint-brush which he held
between his teeth. The resultant writing was extraordinarily like the
‘ spiritual9script as photographed and reproduced in your book.

b) On p. 147 you reproduce a 'message9 [see tracing, p. 197]
which appeared near the Blue Room on June 16, 1931. You
regard it as reading, ‘ Get-Light-Mass-and-Prayers-Here,9followed
1 See p. 217.
200 THE END OF BORLEY RECTORY
by an undecipherable scribble. To me the remainder of the
‘ message’ is relatively plain. First comes what I take to be a signa­
ture ‘ S ib il'— the l being formed like the Greek A
.. Then follows,
as it were in the form of a postscript, the words ‘ Mas by Boy.’ It
seems as though the whole ‘message’ were meant to read: ‘ Get-
Light-Mass-and-Prayers-Here-Sibil-Mas(s)-by-Boy. ’ Superficially,
it makes no more sense. But there may be some significance which
attaches to the name ‘Sibil’ (or ‘ Sybil ’), and particularly to what I
call the postscript, ‘Mas(s)-by-Boy,’ and which is not apparent to
the casual reader.
I congratulated M r Smith upon his ingenuity. The reader
now has the choice of interpreting the ‘ odd marks’ as ‘ light’
upside down; or as ‘ Finis’ ; or as ‘ Sibil.’
Mrs C. H . B. Gowan, to whom I referred in an earlier chapter,
thinks that the message (Plate IX ) reading ‘ Marianne-Please-
help-get’ is uncompleted. It certainly ends with a scrawl and
looks as if the writer had been forcibly pulled away just as she
was beginning the last word. If so, then Mrs Gowan thinks the
message should read: ‘ Marianne, please help! Get. . . .’
M r G. S. Taylor, of Portobello Farm, Watlington, Oxon, also
gets the ‘ Well-Tank-Bottom-Me’ rendering, and makes the
following very interesting observation. He says (February 16,
1942): ‘ Having read your book with attention, I note that one of
the pencilled “ M a ” messages was written on the wall close to
the well, and that the “ scratch” described on p. 223 was close
to it. I should very much like to know in which direction that
arrow pointed!’
The ‘ M a ’ to which M r Taylor refers is reproduced at p. 145
of my book, and was found on the wall of the kitchen passage.
(See Ground Floor Plan, on which the letters are marked
No. 5.) At p. 223 of my book I record that on the morning of
July 19, 1937, the Rev. A . C. Helming and M r Kerr-Pearse,
after locking all the doors of the Rectory, went by car to Sudbury,
where they stayed an hour or so. When they returned (at
12.5 p.m.) they again inspected all rooms and passages and,
quoting the official report, ‘ discovered a deep scratch or incision
on the ground-floor passage wall near the pencilled “ M a ” dis­
covered by Kerr-Pearse [previously].’ The scratch, which was
ARROW POINTED TO GRAVE 201
not there at 9 a .m., was there three hours later, though the
Rectory was securely locked up, and normal entry was impos­
sible. The report continues: ‘ The mark was in the form of an
arrow-shaft and its head.3
I remember the arrow well, and it was pointing downward to
the left. To the left of the ‘ M a 3 marking were the stairs leading
to the cellars, and at the bottom of these stairs was the shallow
tank or ‘ well3 (‘ well-tank3), under which, almost exactly six
years later, were found the fragments of human remains. (See
Cellar Plan.) So the arrow might have had some significance,
as M r Taylor suggests. In fact, literally a ‘ pointer3 or clue.
Miss E. M . Smith, of St Clement’s House, Bolsover Street,
London, W .i, thinks, with M r Heaton, that in the ‘ odd marks3
message (see p. 197), the second line from the bottom is the
inverted word ‘ light.3 And she says (December n , 1942): ‘ the
bottom line of this script is a misspelt version of “ M as(s)-by-
AB(b)ey.3
3 3 Miss Smith’s rendering approximates to her name­
sake’s cM as(s)-by-Boy3(see above), except that the word‘ abbey3
suggests the monastic site on which the Rectory is alleged to
have been built. It also suggests the ‘ monk and nun3legend.
The Rev. Dr W . G. Peck, and his son, the Rev. David G.
Peck, B.A., of 45 Castelnau Mansions, London, S.W .13, in dis­
cussing the wall-writings, write (September 22, 1943):
We think the wall-writings, if the possibility of fraud (conscious
or unconscious) may be finally excluded, are extremely important,
for it seems difficult to account for them on any less hypothesis than
that some conscious and volitional psychic entity was responsible
for their production. And although the ‘messages3 occurred only
when Mrs Foyster was living at the Rectory, a mark of any sort,
made apparently by no visible agency, while the house was being
investigated in a thoroughly scientific maimer, is a sufficient pro­
blem. . . . The two instances of the message being confused by
words superimposed on other words: does this suggest the possi­
bility of a person writing surreptitiously, not looking at what he or
she was doing, but perhaps keeping a look-out against an unwanted
interruptor (or working in darkness)? O f course, assuming a ‘ psy­
chic entity3 at work, we may suppose that the difficulty of the
operation might be fairly held to account for such confiisions in
the script.
202 THE END OF BORLEY RECTORY
I agree, and as for a ‘ normal5explanation ofthe writings, were
we to discard from our calculations every one of the ‘ messages5
there would still remain all the markings that appeared during
the visits of our many official observers. Some of these marks
(¿.g., the ‘ Prince of Wales’s feathers5 [or fleur-de-lis*]) spon­
taneously appeared under controlled conditions, in the presence
of the investigators. And if the messages were produced normally
there was certainly no need to write them surreptitiously. The
Rectory was such a huge bam of a place, and, latterly, was never
occupied at any one time by more than two or three (usually two)
persons, that an occupant of the house could have covered the
walls with writing at his or her leisure without any other occu­
pant being aware of the fact and without being disturbed. And
often, owing to the normal domestic and parochial duties of such
a household, there must have been long periods when one of the
occupants was quite alone in the house. Our hypothetical normal
writer, therefore, would have had no need to act either surrepti­
tiously or in darkness. And as Professor Stevenson points out
(above), all the writings were on one side of the house— the most
occupied and most frequented side; the side where the messages
would attract the most (and earliest) attention— and, if the
messages were produced normally, the side most dangerous to
the writer on account of possible interruption and detection.
But if produced by a ‘ psychic entity,5 who wanted to attract
immediate attention, the most frequented side of the house is, of
course, where they would appear.
My last letter (out of many I could cite) is from Mr Derek M.
Hall (whom I have quoted previously), who says: ‘ Would it
be possible to make a “ pencil5
5 which, while leaving no visible
mark at the time of writing, would produce a mark after some
lapse of time, due to the oxidizing or other chemical process?5
Such a pencil could be made, but the writing would not have
the appearance of lead-pencil writing. I analysed tiny portipns
of the wordings and, under microscopical examination, proved
that the ‘ lead5 used was plumbago, or graphite, of which the
ordinary lead-pencils of commerce (and the domestic black lead)

‘ m a r i e 3 h a d a c h o i c e of p e n c i l s 203
are made. I noted that both ‘ hard5 and ‘ soft5pencils had been
used, the different grains being quite apparent.
W ell, the reader can amuse himself by discovering further
interpretations or variants of the ‘ appeals/ and I am most
grateful to all my correspondents who have sent me such interest­
ing and revealing suggestions; It is not their fault that the
mystery of the wall-writings has not been completely solved.
Whoever, or whatever, wrote them could not have visualized
that, sixteen years later, psychical researchers would still be
puzzling their heads about them !
CHAPTER XII
THE WALDEGRAVES
T
HE Waldegraves, an influential Roman Catholic family,
were intimately connected with Borley for some three
hundred years, during which period they were patrons of the
church and held the Manor of Borley. A descendant of Sir
Richard Waldegrave (who died in 1402) was Sir Edward
Waldegrave, the first1member ofthis family actively connected
withBorley. He wasimprisonedduringthereignofEdwardVI
for his loyalty to the princess, afterwards Queen Mary, and he
received from her the Manor of Chewton, in Somersetshire.
Chewton Priory, Bath, is the present seat of the Waldegrave
family.
Sir Edward Waldegrave (c. 1517-61) was Member of Parlia­
ment for Essex and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He
w
as knighted at the Coronation of Queen Mary in 1553. After
Mary’s death he suffered a reverse of fortune, and he was a
prisoner in the Tower of London (his crime w
as permitting the
sayingofaMass atBorley), wherehediedonSeptember 1,1561.
HemarriedFrances (whodiedin 1599), daughterofSir Edward
Neville, and had three sons and three daughters. His wife sur­
vived himfor thirty-eight years, taking for her second husband
Chedick Paulet, third son of William Paulet, first Marquis of
Winchester. He was Governor of Southampton. The Paulet
arm
s can be seenon the Waldegrave tomb.
Sir Edward Waldegrave, his wife, and their six children are
depictedon theveryornate tomb at thenorth-east comer ofthe
nave in Borley Church. As, thanks to the skill of Mr David E.
Scherman (the photographer on the staffofLife, the American
weekly), I am able to reproduce (Plate VI) such an excellent
picture ofthe Waldegrave monument, I will describe it in some
detail.

T H E W A L D E G R A V E T O M B 205
This altar-tomb, fourteen feet high, is made of cluncK* (i.e.,
indurated clay or hard chalk), with painted recumbent effigies of
Sir Edward and Frances. The man is in plate armour and
the woman in flat cap and large ruff, with crests at the feet of
both effigies. The tomb has panelled sides, with the kneeling
figures of their three sons and three daughters, each with an
inscription and coat of arms. The canopy of the tomb has a
coffered soffit, resting on six Corinthian columns. The cornice
is surmounted by cresting and achievement of arms, and a shield
of arms. At angles, there are figures of cherubs holding car-
touches of arms. The monument has a marginal inscription in
Latin and a record of other alliances of the family. It is an
outstanding example of sixteenth-century work and appears to
be in perfect condition.
On the north wall of the chancel is a painted tablet of Magdala
Waldegrave (third daughter of Sir Edward), wife of John
Southcote, which was put up to her memory after her death in
1598. She is shown kneeling in prayer, wearing a flat head­
dress and ruff, with tight-fitting bodice and loose skirt, and a
sleeveless mantle over her shoulders. The monument is flanked
by Ionic columns, with a shield of arms above cornice.1
The Rev. Francis G. S. Nicolle, Vicar of St Thomas's, Bethnal
Green, in a letter to me dated October 18, 1942, says:
I have come across a piece of information which may be of suffi­
cient interest to pass on to you. It would seem that Sir Edward
Waldegrave was not, after all, the first of that family to be associated
with Borley, but his grandfather, also named Edward. This is how
the story works out: Sir Thomas (great-grandson of Sir Richard,
the Speaker of the House of Commons) married Elizabeth, eldest
daughter of Sir John Fray, and died in 1500. He was succeeded
by William, the eldest of his three sons. The second son, Edward
(ancestor of the present family), had settled at Borley, in Essex,
and married Elizabeth, daughter o f John Chayney, of Devon.
He too died in 1500, and was succeeded by his only son, John
Waldegrave, who married Lora, daughter o f Sir John Rochester,
who died in 1514. Sir Edward, who married Frances, daughter of

Borley andListon Churches, byJ. M. Bull (1937).
206 t h e e n d o f b o r l e y r e c t o r y
Sir Edward Neville, and died in the Tower under Elizabeth in
1561, was the eldest son of this marriage.
It is highly probable that the bodies of the Waldegraves,
depicted on the tomb, were interred at Borley. There is a crypt
under Borley Church, and our efforts to find it will be described
in another chapter. As I recorded at p. 50 of my previous mono­
graph on the Borley case, Miss Ethel Bull informed us that,
many years previously, coffins in the crypt had been para-
normally moved— as in the classic case of the chaunted vault5
at Christ Church, Barbados.1 It is presumed that the coffins
were those of the Waldegrave family. From time to time pheno­
mena in Borley Church have been recorded.
Sir Edward5
s second son, Nicholas, inherited the Borley pro­
perty. Mrs Georgina Dawson says:
Nicholas Waldegrave, the second son, sometimes called Sir
Nicholas, but I am not certain that this is correct. He inherited
Borley, and from him all the later Borley Waldegraves are descended.
Nicholas must have been bom between 1550 and 1561, when his
father died, and he himself died on June 19,. 1621, possessed of the
Manor of Borley Hall, ten acres (probably woodland) in Bulmer,
and some unspecified share in the church and Manor of Langenhoo.
. . . Nicholas’s eldest son, Philip Waldegrave, married twice. . . .
His eldest son John by the first wife appears to have had only the
one son, Philip, who is listed as a recusant in 1715, and on whose
death the Borley Waldegraves.came to an end, and the estates
passed to James, Lord Waldegrave.
He was later made an earl. Philip Waldegrave died in 1720-21.
The Waldegraves lived at Borley Hall, on the river Stour,
built in the first half of the sixteenth century. It is marked on
modem Ordnance Survey maps,2 and has long been occupied
by the Payne fam ily.. Borley Manor house (now called Borley
Place) is the old house nearly opposite the Rectory, and is the
residence of M r Basil Payne. In the cellars are considerable
remains of a much earlier building, and associated with it is
the familiar story of a "secret tunnel.5 Ancient maps of the

OTHER BORLEY RECTORIES 207
district show only two houses at Borley— the ‘ H all5 and the
ePlace.5
As for Borley Rectory, it is certain that earlier buildings
have been erected on the site. The Herrmgham family had a
rectory there, and there are memorials to them in Borley Church.
In my previous monograph I assumed that the Waldegraves also
had a house where the Rectory now stands— or, rather, stood.
I was wrong. But it is possible— even likely— that the W alde­
graves had a chaplain’s house on the site. It is certain that there
was a rectory at Borley in the sixteenth century, with a high
degree of probability that it was built opposite the church,
where our ‘ haunted house5 stood. During our investigations we
discovered the footings or foundations of an ancient building in
the cellars of the Rectory. It had been constructed of the old
two-inch bricks.
Concerning the f
imonastery5 tradition, it is very unlikely that
such a foundation ever existed at Borley. But just across the
river Stour, that here forms the boundary between Essex and
Suffolk, there was a Priory. Mrs Dawson says:
But. though there was no monastery, etc., actually on the site o f
the present Rectory, there was a Priory near Borley, whose lands
probably adjoined Borley, and as the Priory was Benedictine, and
the land at Borley owned by the Benedictines, this must be the
explanation of the tradition o f ‘ Borley Monastery/ But so far as
can be discovered, the only link between the Benedictine Priory
and Borley was that the Benedictine Order had ‘ Free Warren9
at Borley, and the later connexion of the Waldegraves with the
Benedictines would further confuse the matter.
The ruins of the Priory are still extant.
W e need not have concerned ourselves with the Waldegraves
at all, except for two reasons: (a) the fact that the name
‘ Waldegrave5 was recurrent in the Planchette scripts, with the
implication— even the assertion— that a member of this family
(whose name was later given as ‘ Henry5) strangled ‘ Mary
Lairre,5 the nun-ghost, in 1667; and (fi) for the theory evolved
by Mrs Georgina Dawson, of Leavenheath, near Colchester,
that the nun-ghost was Arabella Waldegrave.
208 t h e e n d of b o r l e y r e c t o r y
As for ‘ Henry Waldegrave,’ we know two members of the
family whose Christian name was ‘ H enry/ and neither could
have been concerned with ‘ Mary Lairre/ if she died in 1667.
One ‘ Henry’ is the first Lord Waldegrave, created a peer by
James II. O f course he was a Roman Catholic, and he died in
exile in 1689, when a member of King James’s suite. He was
bom in 1660, and was created Baron Waldegrave of Chewton
in 1686. He married Henrietta Fitzjames (1670-1730), the
natural daughter of James II and Arabella Churchill. Their
sons were James, first Earl Waldegrave (1684-1741), and Henry
Waldegrave (our second ‘ Henry’ ), who died a bachelor in 1792.
Their daughter was Arabella Waldegrave, of whom more
anon. M r Winston Churchill is a collateral descendant of this
family.
So it is apparent that in 1667 our first Henry was only seven
years old, and his son, Henry, was not even bom. But the
records of the Waldegrave family are both confused and confus­
ing, and there may have been other ‘ Henrys’ who flourished at
about the time that ‘ Mary Lairre’ did. If there were I have not
come across them. Anyway, it would be unwise to depend on
the Planchette scripts for the name o f‘ Mary’s’ strangler.
Arabella Waldegrave
On April 23, 1943, 1 had a letter from Mrs Dawson (who was
a stranger to me), asking for particulars of the clothing of the
‘ nun’ alleged to haunt Borley Rectory. She told me that she
had been doing some research work into the history of Borley,
‘ and what caused such powerful effects there.’ She remarked
that ‘ M y inquiries are not yet complete, but I feel I am on the
right lines and that the lady [the nun-ghost] was Arabella
Waldegrave, bom in 1687, daughter of Henry, first Lord
Waldegrave and Henrietta Fitzjames, and a grandchild of King
James II.’
This remarkable information was of the greatest interest, as
it tended to demolish, at one blow, our theory (based on the
Planchette records) that the ‘ nun’ might be a French girl named
Mary Lairre. Mrs Dawson kindly offered to let me have her
INTRODUCING ARABELLA WALDEGRAVE 209
notes accumulated during the research work, and these duly
arrived on June 12, 1943.
Her typed 6notes’ turned out to be a dossier of Borley, the
church, the many Rectors dating from 1313, the Rectory, the
4castle,5 the 4monastery,5 and the Waldegraves, running to
20,000 words! She has done a really magnificent piece of
research work, and a history of Borley could be compiled from
her records. She had no absolute proof that Arabella was the
Borley nun-ghost— but she did prove that, after tracing her
early history, the girl vanished into thin air— without trace.
This would be remarkable enough in such a distinguished family
as the Waldegraves, whose contemporary records are available.
But that a king’s grandchild should so disappear is in the nature
of a phenomenon. But that Arabella did disappear seems certain.
Briefly, Mrs Dawson’s story is this. During the period of the
fight for the Protestant succession James II and his Court fled
to Paris. This was in 1688. The Waldegraves, being staunch
Catholics, went with them— so did little Arabella, then aged one
year. Arabella’s early girlhood was spent with the Court at
Saint-Germain, and at the age of seven she was sent to the
convent school of the Benedictines at Pontoise, near Paris, where
her aunt and cousin were nuns (some fifteen members of the
Waldegrave family professed and became nuns.) Arabella’s
name is mentioned several times in the convent’s archives.
Apparently, Arabella was a naughty girl, and she left— or was
dismissed from— Pontoise. According to Foley’s Records, she went
to Paris and became a nun. And that is the last we hear of her.
Every other member of the Waldegrave family has been ac­
counted for, but not Arabella. It was as if the earth had
swallowed her up.
The above are all thefacts I possess about Arabella. But from
Mrs Dawson’s researches, it has been assumed that the girl
eventually became a spy or agent for the Stuart Pretenders, or
perhaps for the British Government in London. And there is
also a theory that Arabella finally found her way to Borley,
where, perhaps, she was murdered. Hence the 6nun-ghost.’ Mrs
Dawson may have further evidence supporting this contention;
o
210 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
but if so I have not seen it. I understand that she is publishing
the full story of her discoveries. It will be read with the greatest
interest.
During her researches Mrs Dawson discovered that Arabella’s
mother, Henrietta Waldegrave, did become a spy for the British
Government and was expelled from Paris in 1695. She was sent
to a convent, escaped, and returned to England to oppose the
Stuart Pretenders.
It must have been fairly easy for any member of the Walde­
grave family to escape to— or from— the Continent, as, in addi­
tion to being the lords of the Manor of Borley, they also owned
Langenhoo, a lonely spot on the Essex marshes, not very far from
Borley, and near the sea. And the Rector of Borley was also
Rector of Langenhoo, ah ideal place for the smuggling over of
priests— or recusant nuns! Arabella’s mother, Henrietta, died
in 1730. Her grandmother also died in 1730, aged about eighty.
If our information about Arabella is so scanty we know a
little more about her grandmother, and I cannot resist giving
Lord Macaulay’s remarks concerning her. He says:1
1685. Soon after the Restoration, in the gay and dissolute times
which have been celebrated by the lively pen of Hamilton,2James,
young and ardent in the pursuit o f pleasure, had been attracted by
Arabella Churchill, one of the maids of honour who waited on his
first wife. The young lady was plain: but the taste o f James was
not nice: and she became his avowed mistress. She was the
daughter of a poor Cavalier knight who haunted Whitehall, and
made himselfridiculous by publishing a dull and affected folio, long
forgotten, in praise of monarchy and monarchs. The necessities
of the Churchills were pressing: their loyalty was ardent; and their
only feeling about Arabella’s seduction seems to have been joyful
surprise that so homely a girl should have attained such high
preferment.
Such is the reward of virtue! Arabella Churchill’s brother, John
Churchill, became the first Duke of Marlborough.
Well, I am grateful to Mrs Dawson for her records, which
Canon Phythian-Adams too has perused with much interest. So

MARIE OR ARABELLA?
now we have two claimants (there are others; see Chapter X X I I )
to the honour o f haunting Borley R ectory: ‘ M ary Lairre’ and
Arabella Waldegrave. As I have stated, I have seen no proofs
that the latter ever visited Borley, either in the flesh or in the
spirit. O n the other hand, we have a few clues or ‘ indicators’—
for what they are worth— pointing to ‘ M ary Lairre’ as the
nun-ghost, and these I will enumerate in the next chapter. What
Canon Phythian-Adams thinks o f the Arabella-nun-ghost theory,
and his observations, will be found in Chapter X V .
I cannot close this chapter without mentioning that Borley
Rectory is not the only alleged haunted house that has been
associated with the Waldegrave family. Strawberry H ill, near
Teddington, is another.
Strawberry Hill was purchased by Horace W alpole in 1748.
H e converted an old cottage into a castellated pseudo-florid-
Gothic monstrosity, very flimsy, little better than lath and plaster
(W alpole boasted that he had ‘ outlived three sets o f battlements’ ),
and turned it into a sort o f museum. He filled it with artistic
treasures which were dispersed in 1842. A t his death in 1797 he
bequeathed the property to the Hon. Mrs Anne Darner, the
sculptress, the reversion o f the house to pass at her death to the
Dowager Countess o f Waldegrave. Actually, Mrs Darner parted
with it before she died, and the Waldegraves came into posses­
sion. I do not know the details o f the alleged haunting. The
house has, o f course, been much altered since the time o f
W alpole, who here wrote his romantic Castle o f Otranto ( 1764),
and the still more famous Letters. It was here, too, that W alpole
established his private ‘ Strawberry Hill Press’ in August 1757.
CH APTER x m
CLUES AND ‘ INDICATORS’
A
S I have stated in a previous chapter, when my original
monographon Borleywas completed my collaborators and
I thought that our work was done. The Rectory fire seemed to
put ‘Finis’ to our endeavours.
Then came Canon Phythian-Adams’s skilful analysis of the
wall-writings, his many helpful suggestions, and, above all, his
ingenious—and logical—theory as to the probable causation of
theBorleydrama. He toldusto dig. He alsodiscoveredcertain
clues and ‘indicators’ that pointed to the possibility of there
being something buried in the cellar which, if dug up, might
confirmthe conclusions at whichwe had tentativelyarrived.
Several years have elapsed since I received Canon Phythian-
Adams’s analysis, and during this period I have been carefully
studying all the possible indicia that might help us further. I
will nowlist them. These discriminating m
arks and indications
have been extracted fromthe wall-writings (visible); the spoken
‘m
essages’ (audible); the‘touchings5(tactual);fromvariousphe­

infact, thatonthestrengthofthemandCanonPhythian-Adams’s
theorywe decided to open up the two cellar wells in anattempt
to find the rem
ains of ‘ Mary Lairre.’
First of all, there is every indication that the nun was French.
She tells us sheis French; thather name is ‘Mary Lairre’ (one
Planchette signature was Marie Lairre), a French name; and
thatshe camefromHavre. It has been objected that she writes
(Planchette) ‘Havre’ and not ‘Le Havre.’ But the definite
article‘Le’ isfrequentlyomitted. AsIwrite,IhaveaContinental

Then we have the two French medallions that cappeared 3
during M r Smith’s incumbency: a Roman Catholic pendant* as
issued to French children when they are confirmed. It was made
in Paris* but was found at Borley in 1929. With it came another
medal* dated 1799, issued in Paris during the French Revolution.
A small gold French pendant was found under the cellar floor,
and I will describe this in the next chapter.
As Canon Phythian-Adams points out (p. 266)* it was ‘ a big
French dictionary3 that bumped to the floor, as M r P. Shaw

His bedroom door was locked and the windows closed. The
dictionary may have been another 'indicator3 pointing to Mary
Lairre’s French extraction. And the construction of the wall
cappeals3was such as a French girl, with an imperfect knowledge
of English* might have written.
If Mary Lairre was French it is certain that she was a Catholic.
The many appeals for help have a Roman Catholic flavour. The
repeated calls for Requiem Mass* prayers, incense, and light all
suggest a young Catholic girl in distress. Assuming that Mary
was in any way responsible for the more violent phenomena, it is
significant that— as M r Foyster records in his diary— 'there was
absolute quiet during Holy Week3 and usually on Sundays.
In November 1938 Flight-Lieutenants Caunter and R . Carter
Jonas paid an unexpected visit to the Rectory. M y tenancy had
expired some months previously. The house was empty and no
one had been there for weeks. They stayed one night only.
Reporting their visit, Carter Jonas wrote m e: 'There was an
overpowering smell o f incense in one of the rooms.31 Incense is again
suggestive of the Roman Catholic faith, and may be another
indicator.
Still another significant fact is that it was a priest, Dom
Richard Whitehouse, O.S.B., who received such a direct appeal
in the wall message which appeared on June 16, 1931, near the
Blue Room (see.p. 197). He was a priest of the Order o f St
Benedict* an Order frequently referred to in the Planchette
scripts, and an Order long connected with Borley. And it was

THE END OF BORLEY RECTORY
214
Dom Richard who experienced the amazing physical pheno­
mena at the Rectory during May and June 1931. Another priest,
the Rev. A. C. Henning, received the name ‘ Mary Lairre’ in a
Planchette message.
Another possible ‘ indicator’ is the pile of hymn-books that
‘ appeared’ at the Rectory during M r Foyster’s incumbency.
They were Anglican— and not Roman Catholic— hymn-books,
but they were perhaps all part of the religious m otif that is so
apparent in the Borley drama.
‘ Mary Lairre’ was a woman. O f course, we have her statement
for that in the Planchette scripts. But there are other indicia that
point to the fact that the unquiet spirit at Borley was a woman.
It was to two sympathetic young women that ‘ M ary’ addressed
most of her appeals. These were Mrs Foyster and Miss Helen
Glanville. If it were indeed a fact that the Rectory was haunted
by the phantasm of a girl it would be natural that if it needed
help it should seek out young people of its own sex. Another
woman, Lady Whitehouse, experienced striking phenomena
during her visits to the Rectory.
The ‘ strange coat’— a woman's coat— that mysteriously ap­
peared and disappeared at the Rectory may have been another
‘ indicator’ drawing attention to the fact that a woman needed
help.
A Tactual Clue
Mrs F. A . Mansbridge, wife of a Bank of England official, •
while standing by the ‘ cold spot’ outside the Blue Room, was
touched by something. Her husband records: ‘ September 5,
1937: M y w ifefelt the end o f the belt o fher coat lifted and dropped again.
The movement was so definite as to make her look down at it.’
This action suggests that a feminine entity was trying to attract
the attention of a human of her own sex. It was a woman’s
gesture.
It was in the sewing-room (see Plan II), a woman’s room, that
so many phenomena occurred, from the early days of the haunt­
ing right down to the period of the Cambridge Commission. It
was outside the sewing-room, in the passage, that two ‘ wall-
appeals’ appeared.

It was in the sewing-room that M r Kerr-Pearse found a lump
of touchwood, in the grate, on July 18, 1937. It spontaneously
appeared and is still the subject of much speculation.
The two gold wedding-rings found at the Rectory point to a
woman, to a marriage, and perhaps to a tragic marriage. Or
perhaps to the fact that there was no marriage! One was dis­
covered by Mrs Foyster in her bathroom on March 10, 1931. It
disappeared on the following day. The other— perhaps the same
one— Mr Motion and I picked up in the Blue Room on the last
day of my tenancy. This was on May 9, 1938.
"M arie Lairre3 was a nun. She tells us so in the Planchette
scripts. But we have other evidence— if it be evidence. Practi­
cally all the "figures,5phantasms, and ghosts seen during the past
sixty years have been in the form of a nun. She has been seen
by many people. We have the first-hand evidence of at least
fifteen witnesses that the nun has been seen. Some of the ob­
servers saw her several times. Miss Rosemary Williams saw a
"girl in white5 at the window aperture of the bumt-out Blue
Room on March 26, 1939. This too may have been the nun.
Then there are the French Catholic medallions or pendants,
such as a nun might wear. These are perhaps only indicators
pointing to a nun, and to a French nun.
I will now deal with the more direct clues that support the
theory that a French nun named Marie Lairre needed help; that
she was murdered at Borley by a young Waldegrave; and that
her remains might be found in the cellar. I will first take the
wall-writings.
VISIBLE CLUES
As I have pointed out, one of the most striking clues we have
discovered is the French word
"Trompée.5
This, perhaps, was a desperate attempt to convey to us that
the writer was French and that she had been "deceived.5 In the
Planchette script she says she was strangled "by a Waldegrave.5
Then we have a clue to where she might be found :
4Well— Tank— Bottom— Me.3
216 t h e e n d o f b o r l e y r e c t o r y
I think that the skull (history unknown) that Mrs Smith found
in the cupboard of the Rectory library is a possible indicator
suggesting that a skull, or remains, could be found somewhere__
if we searched for them. The fact that we did find a fragment of
a skull in the ‘ well-tank,’ or where it used to be, is perhaps some
confirmation for this suggestion.
‘ Ma ’ and Pointing Arrow
As M r Taylor pointed out,1 the arrow that was afterwards
found close to the letters ‘ M a ’ in the kitchen passage may be an
indicator pointing to the ‘ well-tank.’
T he Waldegrave Crest?
On M ay 7, 1938, M r M . Savage, one of the B.B.C. television
engineers, and a friend visited the Rectory. They witnessed new
pencil markings that spontaneously appeared when they were
within a yard of them. This was in the Blue Room. In Room
No. 5, the dressing-room leading out of the Blue Room, they
witnessed further markings that also appeared spontaneously.
With his report,2 M r Savage sent a sketch of these marks, and
in my book I commented upon the fact that they were rather
like the ‘ Prince of Wales’s feathers.’ Professor Stevenson sug­
gests3 that perhaps the communicator was trying to draw the
fleur-de-lis— again pointing to her French nationality.
The sketch— or rather sketches— that M r Savage sent me
consisted of a series offour sets of markings. (See reproduction.)
Three ofthe sets were each composed offour strokes, representing
the ‘feathers,’ and one set comprisedfive strokes.
When my book appeared Mr Edwyn R . Bevan, O .B.E.,
F.B.A., M .A ., D.Litt., LL.D., the archaeologist, of Yatscombe
Cottage, Boar’s Hill, Oxford, drew my attention to the fact that
the markings discovered by Mr Savage might have been an
attempt at a representation of the Waldegrave crest. M r Bevan
happens to be a kinsman of the Waldegraves, and the similarity
between what I called the ‘ Prince of Wales’s feathers’ and the
Waldegrave crest at once occurred to him-

THE WALDEGRAVES5 CREST? 217
M r Bevan pointed out (August 24, 1942) that the Prince of
Wales’s crest has three ostrich feathers rising out of the coronet,
whereas the Waldegrave crest has five. As we have seen, M r
Savage’s drawings depicted three
sets of four ‘ feathers’ and one of
five. It certainly does appear as if
the entity (Marie?) who drew
them was trying to delineate the
Waldegrave crest. The sketch
with the five ‘feathers’ was at the
bottom of the set of four drawings
— which suggests it was the last
attempt. They were about five
feet from the floor. Gan we regard
these ‘ crests ’ as an indicator point­
ing to a Waldegrave?
AUDIBLE CLUES
We have examined some possible
visible clues to the Borley tragedy,
and I will now list some audible
ones. *prince of Wales’sfeathers ’

Sibilant W hisperings that spontaneouslyappeared

wife had hardly moved into the servers
Rectory when (at the latter part of 1928) M r Smith heard
‘ distinct sibilant whisperings’ on the landing near his bedroom.
He was alone in the house. The whisperings were afterwards
heard many times, and always in the same place. The sounds
were curiously localized because M r Smith had only to advance
a few paces when they ceased. When he returned to the original
spot the whispering could again be heard.
‘ Don’t, Carlos, Dont! ’
One day, as Mr Smith was crossing this same landing, he
heard a woman’s voice exclaim, ‘ Don’t, Carlos, don’t !’ The
218 THE END OF BORLEY RECTORY
appeal was preceded by a sort of moaning sound, an d d ied away
in a confused muttering. This particular voice was h eard once
only.
A Call to Marianne
The Smiths’ first psychic experience at the R ecto ry was the
hearing of the ‘ sibilant whisperings/ followed by th e appeal to
‘ Carlos.’ His successor’s first experience was a sim ilar one. On
the day that Mr Foyster and his wife took up residence at the
Rectory they both heard the name ‘ M arianne’ called out.
Marianne is Mrs Foyster’s Christian name. This w as the start
of the Marianne appeals that afterwards appeared o n walls and
pieces of paper.'
Is it not possible that ‘ Mary Lairre’ was trying, vocally, to
attract the attention of each new incumbent? T h e ‘ Carlos’
appeal was very distinct. It is possible that a C h arles Walde-
grave was concerned in our hypothetical tragedy. ‘ C a rlo s’ may
have been the name by which Marie addressed h im , or Mr
Smith might have been deceived by Marie’s pronunciation of
‘ Charles.’ I cannot find a ‘ Charles’ among the Waldegraves
that fits into the picture as regards dates. Charles I I (1630-85),
second son of Charles I, fits in admirably. He was aged thirty-
seven when the death of the alleged ‘ Marie L airre’ is said to
have happened. It just occurs to me that what M r S m ith might
have heard was not ‘ Carlos/ but ‘ Carolus.’ Phonetically, of
course, the names are similar. But I cannot imagine even a king
being called ‘ Carolus’ outside of State documents, an d on coins
and seals. Charles II must have known the W aldegraves well,
and even, perhaps, on occasions, paid visits to their Manor at
Borley. This ‘ Carolus’ concept is far-fetched, but everything
connected with Borley is, to put it mildly, unusual.
Church Music
Another possible audible clue is the choir-singing and organ
music which, a number of villagers declare, have been heard in
Borley Church when it was certain that the building contained
neither worshippers nor choristers, and was securely locked. We
have first-hand evidence. Mr Hardy, junior, happening to pass
PLANCHETTE PREDICTIONS FULFILLED 2ig
the church at night, heard ‘ singing or chanting,5 coining from
the fabric, which was in complete darkness, empty, and locked.
Was this still another indicator pointing, once more, to £Requiem
Mass5?
PLANCHETTE AN D TABLE MESSAGES
I now come to the most interesting— and perhaps most impor­
tant— of all clues and indicators, I have already warned the
reader that he must assess these messages at his own valuation.
Taken in conjunction with all the other Borley phenomena, I
think we can accept some ofthem. At least one of the predictions
(and a very definite one) was fulfilled : I refer to the burning of
the Rectory. Before we reach the end of this volume we shall
find that other statements have been verified. I will deal with
the messages and scripts in chronological order (Le., as received),
beginning with those recorded in the ‘ locked book.5 All the
messages— Planchette and table-tipping— were received by the
Glamville family and their friends. Most of the séances were held
at the Glanvilles5 home in Streatham; a few at Borley. It will
be noted that most of the clues and indicators lead up— directly
or indirectly— to the cellars and the well.
October 24, 1937 (Borley).— Much of this table-tipping séance
dealt with the burial of the nun, who was alleged to have
been interred ‘ under a large tree,5 ‘ under trees,5 ‘ under a small
stone,5 ‘ near the house,5 ‘ near the path,5 etc. But the informa­
tion seems contradictory. However, the operators were told
definitely that her remains could and would be found, if searched
for. Also, the communicating entity expressed a desire that the
nun should be searched for, and that her
cGrave was not more than three feet deep.5
October 28, 1937 (Streatham).— From now onward all our
clues come from the Planchette scripts. Miss Helen Glanville,
alone, received some remarkable information and instructions.
The first word that was written was ‘ W ell.5 The script continues :
Do you want us to look in the well— yes or no? Tes.
Is the well in the cellar? Tes.
220 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
Shall we find it in the well in the cellar? Tes.
Do you mean the well that has been filled in? Tes.
It was Mary Lairre who was communicating, and although a
cchild5 is mentioned, here are definite instructions to search in
the efilled-in5well— i.e., thecwell-tank.5 As for the cchild,5Mary
was little more than a child when, she alleged, she was strangled.
October 30, 1937 (Borley).— The Rev. A . G. Henning and M r
S. H. Glanville were using the Planchette at this séance, and Mary
Lairre again announced herself.1 She said she was murdered by
cHenry5 and that her
4remains are near the wall.5
October 31, 1937 (Streatham).— Mary Lairre again communi­
cated and said she
‘ was murdered by Waldegrave5
and that she wanted a Requiem Mass, chant, light, and holy
water; that she was buried n o tcunder the wall,5but
‘ buried at the end o f the wall.5
On January 20, 1945, when this book was half completed,
M r Glanville sent me a folder containing about fifty typed sheets
of transcripts made from Planchette scripts that I had never
previously seen or heard of. I have mentioned how the Glanville
family were compelled to use rolls of white wallpaper when
using the Planchette, because, often, the writing was so large
and was produced so rapidly, and the entities seemed so eager-
to write, that ordinary sheets of paper were useless for the
purpose.
A stack of these rolls, covered on both sides, accumulated. I
have one of them before me, and I will reproduce a small
portion of it in order to give the reader some idea of what
Planchette writing is like. All of these rolls were examined at the
time, and some typed transcriptions were made.
When I came to examine these transcriptions I was struck with
the number of possible clues that had been recorded, as usual,
by Mr Glanville, his family, and his friends. I will now indicate

the best o f them. They were produced between N ovem ber 5,
1937? and M arch 27, 1938.
November 5, 1937 (Streatham).— For the first and last time in
any Planchette script, the term 6M anor o f Borley5 is written.
The ‘ entity5 alleges he is Joseph Glanvill, F.R.S. (M r S. H.
Glanville is a collateral descendant), and writes that if the
operators will go to the M anor o f Borley
‘ THE TRUTH WILL BE FOUND.5
November 20-21,1937 (Borley).— The R ev. A. G. Henning and
M r S. H . Glanville were the operators. T he com m unicating
‘ entity5 at once wrote that a C
cu p 5 was buried in the garden.
This was amplified to ‘ a jew elled cup,5 and, later a ‘ chalice.5
An excellent sketch o f a chalice was drawn on the Planchette script.
C
A Piece of Plate5
T he ‘ entity5then revealed itself as ‘ M arie Lairre5and wrote
that a piece o f plate would be found buried with the cup. The
plate, it was stated, was ‘ buried by a soldier,5 was still buried,
and should be dug up by a priest. Both the ‘ cu p 5 and ‘ plate5
were buried ‘ by wall.5 Asked if she could name the exact place,
‘ M ary5 replied ‘ N o.5 Neither could she tell the operators when
the cup would be recovered. Later, she told the sitters they were
to dig by a ‘ farm wall,5then amplified to brick wall.
‘ My Bones5
Then ‘ M ary Lairre5 said that her bones were buried near the
farm wall, and added, in answer to a question in French, the
word ‘ Grave.5
‘ H e n r y W a l d e g r a v e 5 confesses
Then cam e the following remarkable ‘ interview5:
Who is speaking now? Waldegrave.
What is your Christian name? Henry.
What did you do to the nun, Mary Lairre? Killed.
How? Hands.
Where? Crypt
Is it still here? No.
222 T H E END OF B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
Whereabouts was the crypt? Here.
Were you buried in Borley Church? Tes.
Thus ended this extraordinary séance, with its detailed
‘ inform ation’ concerning the cup, the chalice, the piece o f plate,
and the nun’s tragedy. Perhaps the presence o f the R ev. A . C.
Henning induced the ‘ entities ’ to excel themselves. Som e church
plate was rem oved from Borley Church at the time o f the
Reform ation, and is supposed to be buried. Various attempts
have been made to find it.
W hatever value we may attach to Planchette scripts, it is
worth noting that at Streatham, on O ctober 31, 1937, ‘ M arie
Lairre’ tells Miss Helen Glanville and her brother that she was
strangled by a W aldegrave; and on N ovem ber 20-21, 1937, at
Borley R ectory, ‘ Henry W aldegrave’ confesses to M r Henning
and M r Glanville that he killed M ary ‘ with his hands,’ in the
‘ crypt.’ That must have been the cellars.
December 5, 1937 (Streatham).— During this very long Plan­
chette séance ‘ M arie Lairre’ again com m unicated, saying that
she knew all about the ‘ cu p ’ and that she w ould help us to find
it. She also declared that the ‘ chanting’ in Borley Church (to
which I referred a page or so back) was due to nuns singing;
that the service was ‘ Vespers,’ and that they sang at festivals.
Asked whether she sang with them, ‘ M ary’ said ‘ N o.’
December 12, 1937 (Streatham).— A t this séance Miss Helen
Glanville and her brother R oger were the operators. Perhaps
because they are young they invariably got good results. W hen
I say ‘ g o o d ’ I mean interesting, and this particular sitting was
no exception.
After some curious messages about ‘ pearls in a leaden cistern’
(referred to previously at a séance on the previous day) an ‘ entity,’
who alleged that he was ‘ Henry Bull,’ suddenly wrote the words
‘ Borley R ectory’ and then again,
‘ Bo r le y R e cto ry in the cella r t h e r e .’
T he message was repeated to, him, confirmed as correct, and
then Planchette wrote:
223
C
M È R E B E A U M A R A S 5
cYes. Is a cup buried under the floor one foot
Down near the well . . . in a lead box.5
Asked whether the 'en tity5 could tell the operators how far
from the cellar door ([ i .e the bottom o f the cellar steps) the cup
was buried, "H enry5 said "N o.5 Then a sketch o f the cellar was
m ade (see Plan IV ), the Planchette board was placed upon it,
and the pencil made a cross over where the round well was
marked. T h e "entity5was then asked whether it knew who buried
it there, but there was no reply.
Then cam e another piece o f inform ation that is truly remark­
able, but which can be fitted into the Borley drama. A new
centity5signed itself— or herself—cM èreBeaumaras? said she knew
some one called "Caldibec,5 who was none other than "M ary
Lairre.5 (T he reader will remember "C aldibec5 com m unicating
at previous seances.) Then the following "conversation5ensued:
What happened to her? Murder.
Who by? Waldegrave.
Is Caldibec unhappy? Tes.
Why? In communion with evil.
Why was Caldibec murdered? Sinned.
How? Adored Mammon.
Is she still unhappy because o f that? Tes.
Will she ever be happy again? Tes.
When? When she earnsforgiveness.
How can she do that? By perfect love.
For whom? Waldegrave.
D o you help her yourself? Tes.
How? Prayer.
Are Caldibec and Mary Lairre the same person? Tes.
"M ère Beaumaras5said she was a M other Superior in a convent,
presumably in France. She stated that she was b o m in 1568.
I f w e take all this Planchette information at its face value this
means that the M other Superior must have been aged eighty
when "M arie Lairre5 was b om , as the latter has told us that
she passed over in 1667, aged nineteen. It w ould be possible for
the M other Superior to have known M arie during the w hole o f
her short existence, as it is well known that a conventual life is
224 THE END OF B O R L E Y r e c t o r y
conducive to longevity ('righteousness tendeth unto life5!). The
M other’s last injunctions were, ' Pray for wom en and men in the
service o f the Church,5 and
4Move the stone on the lawn Borley.5
The stone, she said, was 'n ear the summer-house.5 She did
not tell us what might be found under it.

FACSIMILE OF PLANCHETTE SCRIPT. ‘ HENRY’ SAYS THAT THE
HUMAN REMAINS ARE THOSE OF ‘ lAIRRE’
Received December 14, 1937.
Januaiy 12-13, 1938 (Borley).— T he R ev. G. Eric Smith and
his wife visited Borley Rectory for a night, with M r S. H .
Glanville, his. son Roger, and D r H . F. Bellamy. Those I have
named, with M r Smith’s chauffeur, form ed the sitters or opera­
tors at this séance. A ‘ R om an centurion’ com m unicated, said
he was in the Tenth Legion, and promised ‘ inform ation’— pre­
sumably at a later date.
T he only information that interests us came from the ‘ entity’
calling itself ‘ Harry Bull.’ It was asked, ‘ Gan you-tell us where
the skull which Mrs Smith found [in the library cupboard] came
from ?’ ‘ Yes,’ wrote the entity. ‘ It cam e from a w om an.’ The
wom an’s name was not known, but the skull itself cam e ‘ from
Borley.’
March 27, 1938 (Streatham).— This is the last Planchette

script received by the Glanville family o f which I have any
record. I believe there are other rolls o f wallpaper, m ouldering
in their garage, o f which no typed transcripts are available. I f
there are I have not seen them. And, as I have stated, all the
scripts I have dealt with above, beginning N ovem ber 5, 1937,
were not seen by me until January 20, 1945.
However, a portion o f the script, dated M arch 27, 1938, was
entered in M r Glanville5
s clocked book,5 and I reproduced a
part o f it at p. 164 o f my previous m onograph. It is ‘ Sunex
AmuresV threat to bum the Rectory— which was gutted by
fire eleven months later.
W hen I reprinted the extract in m y book, and again in
Chapter V III, I did not realize the significance o f the latter part
o f his ‘ message.5 Perhaps I was too sceptical. However, in the
light o f m y analysis o f the possible clues and ‘ indicators,5 espe­
cially those I found in the scripts that I have just received, I con ­
sider that what ‘ Sunex Am ures5said has acquired a greater im por­
tance-—especially after what we found at Borley in August 1943.
T h e sitters at this séance were Miss H elen Glanville and her
brother Roger, and here is the full message :
*Sunex Amures and one of the men mean to burn the Rectory
to-night at nine o ’clock end of the haunting go to the Rectory and
you will be able to see us enter into our own and under the ruins
you will find bone of murdered [indistinct] wardens [?] under the
ruins mean you to have proof of haunting o f the Rectory at
Borley [indistinct] game tells the story of murder which happened
there.5
Miss Glanville and her brother did not go to the R ectory that
evening at nine o’ clock, as instructed, and that is, perhaps, why
the place was not burnt down on that night ‘ as prom ised5! But
‘ Sunex5 eventually kept his word.
It is a pity that who was murdered was not made clear in the
script. The w ord after ‘ m urdered5 was indecipherable, and the
next word, ‘ wardens,5is meaningless to us. However, the sitters
were not certain that the w ord was ‘ wardens.5 It m ight have
been ‘ ward.5 But the injunction to search under the ruins for
‘ bone o f murdered . . .5is quite unambiguous.
2 2 8 T HE END OF B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
It is significant that though the sitters were changed at the
various séances, which were held at various places, the same
‘ entities5communicated, and the majority o f the messages were
germane to the main theme. And the reader can hardly have
failed to notice how frequently the operators were directed to
the ‘ cellar5 the ‘ w ell5 and the ‘ ruins,5in order to search for the
‘ bones,5 the ‘ chalice,5 and the ‘ plate,5 etc.
I regret very much that the many ‘ clues5 that I have just
(February 7, 1945) given the reader were not in our possession
five years ago. H ad they been I think we would have made a
greater effort to excavate the cellars and wells o f Borley Rectory
before my book was published. The reason why we did not dig
there until August 1943 is explained in the next chapter. The
reader will there and in Chapter X V I II discover that at least
some o f the Planchette ‘ statements’ were found to be not fiction,
but facts.
CHAPTER XIV
‘ T R U T H ’ A T THE B O TT O M OF A W ELL?
H E reader will perhaps be wondering why, when Canon
Phythian-Adams told us ‘ to dig,5we were so long in carry­
ing out his suggestion and at the same time testing his theories.
There were several reasons. In January 1941, when I received
the Canon’s valuable analysis, I was not in possession o f the
m any clues, pointers, and indicators which I afterwards acquired.
There seemed no urgency about the matter. The lower portion
o f the Rectory was still standing, and there was no suggestion
that the place would be demolished. In fact, I was contem plat­
ing buying the ruins for further research work. I now wish I had.
Another factor was that the Rectory— or what remained o f it
— was for sale, and Captain Gregson, the owner, w ould probably
not have given us permission still further to dam age his property.
A nd in the winter o f 1941, owing to enemy action, Essex was not
a particularly healthy spot to linger in, though vital business
m ight necessitate one’s presence there. I will remark in paren­
theses that, at about this time, as M r Henning, the R ector o f
Borley, was steering his car up the drive to Liston R ectory, in
daylight, his hom e and grounds were encircled with bom bs that
nearly blew him out o f the car. Except for the uprooting o f
some big trees, and damage to his garage and windows, no
particular harm was done. But one cannot ‘ investigate’ com ­
fortably under such conditions.
And, to be honest, I did not quite know how to set about the
task o f excavating the cellars and clearing out what I thought
were two deep filled-in wells. I imagined that the larger o f the
tw o latter w ould contain m uch semi-liquid matter and debris
at the bottom , and I was advised to em ploy a well-draining
engine and suction plant in order to rem ove the rubbish. I
inquired about this and found that fifty pounds would be the
cost o f hiring such a plant, w hich would have to com e from
229
230 TH E END OF B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
London. I hesitated because we were working so m uch in the
dark.
However, I made some tentative inquiries from M r Henning
as to the prospect o f getting labour in the Borley district and
found, as I anticipated, that no labour was available. This was
in the summer o f 1941. It requires skilled labour to rem ove the
contents o f a deep well— as a well-digger’sjo b is a dangerous and
not particularly pleasant one.
In the spring o f 1943 I learned that Captain Gregson was
making determined efforts to sell his property as he had been
offered a good appointment abroad. So I decided that the time
had arrived for me to do something about exploring the Rectory
cellars. It was a case o f now or never, as I guessed that anyone
buying the ruins would demolish them for the valuable bricks
and building material— m uch o f it in good condition. So I wrote
to Captain Gregson, explaining the situation, and asked permis­
sion to open up the wells and excavate the cellars. T h e Captain
very kindly gave me carte blanche to do as I pleased in the matter,
and he was personally interested in the project.
I also wrote to the Rev. A . C. Henning, begging him to make
another attempt to find some labour. In his reply M r Henning
said that he had found a man to assist in the digging, and that he
himself would lend a hand with pick and shovel. This was really
magnificent o f him. Unfortunately, with a long-standing strained
heart, I could do no digging myself. W ith his usual kindness,
M r Henning also invited me to make his hom e m y headquarters
during my stay in the district, and offered to assist m e in any
possible way. I gladly accepted hospitality at Liston Rectory,
where I had previously stayed. I will take this opportunity o f
thanking M r and Mrs Henning for their extraordinary kindness
during the days that I spent under their roof. M oreover, at the
last moment they extended their hospitality to m y ex-secretary,
Mrs Alex English (née Miss Ethel Beenham), who had kindly
agreed to act as note-taker and reporter. W ith twelve years’
experience as my assistant in many investigations, she was, o f
course, ideal for the purpose; and I thank her, too, for interrupt­
ing her domestic duties on our behalf.
231
S E A R C H F O R THE C R Y P T
Search for W aldegrave R ecords
As I was going to Borley, I thought I would kill two birds with
one stone and make an attempt to find the entrance to the crypt
of Borley Church. I wished to ascertain whether there were any
records of documents deposited with the Waldegrave coffins in
the crypt— those coffins which, as the reader will remember,
were supposed to have been moved paranormally. W e knew
that they were not buried under the Waldegrave tomb, which I
have already described1 and illustrated.2 I was hoping that we
should find some chronicle or parchment that might have thrown
light on the missing Arabella Waldegrave. So M r Henning
arranged for a Sudbury firm of masons to send workmen with
the necessary tools to meet us at Borley Church on the first
morning of our visit. M r Henning also borrowed from a firm o f
builders at Long Melford a number o f coarse sieves, as every
ton of stuff we removed from the cellars would have to be sifted.
At last the appointed day arrived and we all assembled at
Borley. It will be convenient at this juncture to give the names
o f all those who were interested in the excavations, which began
on August 17, 1943. The following is a complete list of those
who either assisted at the digging, or watched the proceedings, or,
later, gave professional opinions as to what was turned up: the
Rev. and Mrs A. C. Henning, Mrs Alex English, Mrs Georgina
Dawson (whose invaluable researches I have mentioned),
Captain W . H. Gregson and his two nieces; Dr Eric H. Bailey,
M .R.C.S., L.R.C.P., Senior Assistant Pathologist, County
Hospital, Ashford, Middlesex; his brother, M r Roland F.
Bailey, a barrister; Flying-Officer A. A. Creamer, D.F.C., LL.B.
(1st Class Honours, University o f London); and a local labourer
named Jackson, complete with picks, shovels, and other gear.
Both M r R. F. Bailey and Flying-Officer Creamer are civil
servants.
By nine o’clock on the morning o f August 17 both we and the
masons had arrived at Borley Church, and our search for the
crypt began. After a careful survey o f likely entrances to the
space beneath the church the head mason concluded that the
1 See p. 205. 2 See Plate VI.
2 3 2 T H E END OF B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
opening to the crypt must be under a heavy stone slab which had
been let into the central aisle, and which formed part o f the
flooring. Obviously it was too large for an ancient memorial
stone. So the masons erected their tripod and pulleys, and
gradually the slab was raised from its bed. I say ‘ bed,’ because
the stone was resting on a layer o f sand, and there was no open­
ing that led to anywhere beneath the church.
W e were disappointed, but we m ade an interesting discovery.
The stone, it appears, had been laid upside down and was, in
fact, the base o f the pre-Reform ation altar. Probably the stone
had been purposely reversed in order that no indication o f its
origin should be apparent. T he slab weighed nearly a ton and
was five feet long, three feet wide, and six inches thick. It was
splayed, with chamfered edges, and ornamented with ogee
m oulding. I am giving these particulars in order to save some
future historian o f Borley Church the trouble o f erecting lifting
tackle and again raising the stone, which the men replaced
exactly as we had found it.
W e continued our search for an entrance to the crypt, without
result. Then the masons inspected likely spots near the church,
in the churchyard, where they concluded the opening to the
crypt must be. Unfortunately, time did not permit us to start
digging up the churchyard, as we were anxious to get down to
the more important task o f digging up the cellars.
G ales dam age th e R e c to r y
Before I begin to relate our investigations in the cellars I must
give some account o f these cellars and details o f the wells, and
describe the condition in w hich we found the R ectory in August
1943-
The fire that partly gutted the Rectory on the night o f
February 27-28, 1939, did most destruction to the roof and first
floor, nearly all o f which collapsed. T he ground-floor rooms
were less damaged, though the hall and m ain staircase were
com pletely burnt out. I f the reader will study Plate V I I he
will see the condition o f the place when I photographed it a
month after the fire.
S T R A N G E C E L L A R S 233
I again photographed the ruins during our visit in August
1943 (see Plate V III), and the havoc caused by four years’ gales
is very noticeable. I f the reader will com pare the tw o pictures
he will see that all the brick gables at the back and sides o f the
house have fallen to the ground, having been blow n down.
W hat remained o f the iron and glass veranda has disappeared;
and the framework o f the pinnacled ctow er’ at the right o f the
building has also vanished. In addition, some o f the half-burnt
rafters supporting the first floor fell into the rooms below ; and,
as can be seen, shrubs and undergrowth are blocking the lower
windows. The only things that— literally— weathered the storms
were the chimney-stacks.
T he cellars too suffered. Burnt flooring and rafters from the
hall floor and kitchen passage, and most o f the w ooden stairs,
tum bled into the cellars, which later received some tons o f
bricks, when the gables collapsed. H ow ever, ‘ it is an ill
wind . . T he fact that, after the fire, daylight streamed into
the cellars (which formerly were particularly dark) m ade both
digging and photographing easier as regards illumination. But
we could have done without the debris. I have often wondered
what becam e o f the frogs, toads, and lizards that greeted m e in
the cellars on m y first visit in 1929, jum ping and slithering over
floors and walls. W e saw m any young frogs when we em ptied
the well, but the other fauna had com pletely disappeared.
D escription of t h e C ellars
I will now describe the cellars, and the reader should study
Plan IV , showing the lay-out, and Plan II, on which is indicated
the cellar areas which, as can be seen, were below part o f the
library, a com er o f the dining-room , the whole o f the hall, and
parts o f the kitchen passage and the space between the pantry
and the sewing-room. T he cellars (really three separate, con­
nected compartments, as can be seen from Plan IV ) were very
curiously shaped, and their dimensions can be determined from
the ground-floor plan. Their strange shape is due (according
to M r S. H . Glanville, who has m ade a special study o f the R ec­
tory architecture) to their partly conform ing to the foundation
2 3 4 T H E EN D OF B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
walls or footings o f an ancient building that was previously on
the site.’ 1
M r Glanville noticed, as I did, that a part of the cellar floor
(indicated on Plan IV ) had subsided, so he and M r Kerr-Pearse

dug up (November i, 1937) this portion of the cellar. In his
report (cLocked Book/ folio 92) M r Kerr-Pearse says:
We discovered what appeared to be the foundation o f an older
house, the bricks found being the old-fashioned two-inch variety.2
1 T h e M o s t H a u n t e d H o u s e in E n g la n d , p. 20.
2 Some idea as to the age o f these foundations can be gained from the age o f the
two-inch bricks. The bricks made in England before 1625 were o f many sizes,
there being no recognized standard; but in that year the sizes were regulated by
statute, and the present standard size was adopted—namely, 9 in. X in. X 3 in.
Therefore, all the two-inch bricks found at Borley must have been made b e fo r e
1625. Two-inch bricks, or fragments, were found in the cellar wells and under the
cellar flooring (see pp. 239 and 242).—H. P.
C O L D E R A T T H E (C O L D S P O T 3 2 3 5
It then occurred to the writer that this foundation was perpendicu­
lar to the left-hand wall o f the cellar No. 1 [the compartment on
the left o f our Plan IV ]. On investigation this was found to be so.
. When examining this latter wall we found that it also consisted of
two-inch bricks, but from a level o f six inches above the floor
ordinary modem bricks were used. The angles of the most curiously
placed buttresses at the end o f the passage are also parallel to the
two walls already mentioned, which would appear to prove that
this was also part of the older building. A house built on this
supposed former site would face roughly south.
Another curious discovery was m ade: it was found that the
subsidence in the cellar was exactly under the ‘ cold spot5 on the
landing outside the Blue R oom , on which a num ber o f observers
had suddenly felt chilled.1 That the air did at times becom e
cooler at this spot (see Plate X 2) is definitely proved b y the
carefully controlled experiments o f I. S. Longm uir and A . H eap
(members o f the Cam bridge Commission) on the night o f
June 19, 1943, when there was a localized drop o f eleven degrees
Fahrenheit at the ‘ cold sp ot/
As I have stated elsewhere, the only entrance to the cellars
was by a flight o f wooden stairs leading dow n from the kitchen
passage. For light and air two small gratings, below the court­
yard level, had been fixed. T hey furnished little air, and less
light, as they were more or less blocked up with weeds and rank
grass on the occasions when I visited the Rectory. W e could
find our way about the cellars only with the aid o f electric
torches, and even then we had to be careful not to slip on the
slimy floors or tread on the many families o f frogs which were
hopping about all over the place. In the photograph (Plate X I )
can be seen one o f the gratings I have mentioned, and the
charred remains o f the beams that supported the hall floor. In
another picture (Plate X I I ) can be seen some o f the brick wine-
bins, o f which there were many.
T h e F o u r W e l ls
I will now give an account o f the wells, o f which there were
originally four. I have already (pp. 25 and 26) described the main
1 See pp. 80 and 81. 2 And Plate H I, T h e M o s t H a u n t e d H o u s e in E n g la n d .
2 3 6 T H E E N D O r | B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
well (Plate X III) in which was discovered, by means o f a flare
and sinker, an aperture or tunnel sixty-two feet below ground-
level. In the photograph which I now reproduce can be seen the
wheel pum p under the arches in the courtyard, and the cover
over the mouth o f the well.
In a com er o f one o f the cellars we discovered another and
smaller round bricked well (see Plan IV ), filled to the top with
debris and covered with a hatch. W e had no means, at that
period, o f determining its depth. It was three feet in diameter.
I am reproducing a photograph o f it, taken after we had emptied
it in August 1943 (Plate X I V ). It has been partly filled in again,
and water has risen nearly to the top. T o drain this well there
was, anciently, a hand-pum p in the courtyard. This pum p was
still fixed to the wall when I rented the R ectory. In our photo­
graph (Plate X V ) the mark where the pum p had been can be
seen to the right o f the creeper on extreme right o f picture. The
photograph also shows the door leading to the kitchen passage,
above which is the window lighting the main staircase.
In the left foreground o f this same photograph can be seen
the stone slabs covering our third well— a soft-water one that
does not enter into the story.
I now com e to our fourth well— or what was once a well— and
there is considerable mystery concerning it. W hen I was asked
to visit Borley Rectory on June 12, 1929, one o f the first things
we did was to examine the cellars. O ur party, arm ed with
torches, descended the w ooden stairs leading from the kitchen
passage to the cellars. H aving arrived at the bottom o f the stairs,
the man in front stepped to the right in order to allow m e (I was
just behind him ) to lead the way. As m y friend m oved to the
right he stepped on to something which collapsed under him. I
clutched his arm and helped him to extricate his right leg, which
had gone clean through a rotten w ooden hatch-cover into what
was afterwards discovered to be a shallow stone or cement
oblong, rectangular trough or tank w hich was filled with
water.
Later inspection proved it to be (I am speaking from mem ory)
about tw o feet six inches long, tw o feet wide, and nine inches

deep. W e attempted to clear it out, but as we found only old
bottles (there were hundreds o f empty bottles in the cellars) and
broken china in the ‘ w ell/ and as we had no means o f removing
the water, we abandoned our task after warning our friends to
be careful where they walked. The Rev. G. Eric Smith, w ho
was then the Rector o f Borley, told me that he understood that
the tank-like trough (the ‘ well-tank’ o f the wall messages)
marked the site o f an ancient filled-in well.
T h e M issing W ell
In The M ost Haunted House in England (pp. 19 and 20) I mention
the incident o f my friend putting his foot through the hatch-cover.
I say: ‘ A shallow well, properly in the courtyard, extends into
the portion o f the cellar under the kitchen passage. It was
covered in with some boards, rotten and antique, and was
“ discovered” by one o f our observers literally putting his foot
in it, and nearly falling in.5
In the above passage it is obvious that, when writing it, I
was confusing the small round well (Plate X I V ) with the ‘ well-
tank5 at the foot o f the cellar stairs. It was the ‘ well-tank5 that
was under the kitchen passage: the round well was in that
narrow extension o f the cellar (see Plan IV ) that jutted out into
the courtyard. A nd anyone descending the cellar stairs could
not possibly have walked across the round well, which was in a
different part o f the cellar altogether, and was divided from the
cellar passage by a thick partition wall. M y excuse for the con­
fusion about the two wells is that I was writing from m y notes
(which I misread) ten years after the incident, and one hundred
and fifty miles from the Rectory, and without being able to
consult the cellar plan which M r S. H . Glanville subsequently
made specially for the present monograph. A nd now for the
mystery: when we came to search for the ‘ well-tank5 in August
1943 it had completely disappeared! But I will refer to this
later. The only possible reason for making the ‘ well-tank5 was
for catching the surface water, which sometimes flooded the
cellars. As I have stated, they were so damp that frogs, newts,
and lizards thrived there.
2 3 8 T H E EN D OF B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
I must now ret o n to our investigations. After our failure to
find the crypt we went over in a body to the R ectory, just across
the road. After clambering down— at som e risk— what was left
o f the charred stairs leading to the cellars, our first task was
to find the ‘ w ell-tank/ the sunken trough I had seen on m y
visit to the place in 1 9 2 9 . I had decided to start excavating on
this site because I thought that here was the most likely spot for
good results in view o f Canon Phythian-Adams’s analysis, the
wall message (‘ well-tank-bottom -m e’ ), and other indicia. But
the first thing to do was to rem ove some o f the rubbish from o ff
the floors— broken brickwork, tiles, bottles, and heaps o f rubble.
O f course, the first area we tackled (I say ‘ w e,’ but I could take
no part in such strenuous work on account o f m y heart) was the
ground to the right o f the cellar stairs. W e began at 9 .3 0 a .m .
After clearing several square yards and almost boxing ourselves
in with the heaps o f rubble that we had piled up I was forced
to the conclusion that the well-tank was missing! It certainly
was not where it was in 1 9 2 9 .
First D a y ’s D iggin g
O ne o f the difficulties o f working in the R ectory cellars was
what to do with all the rubbish that littered the place. W e could
not remove it above ground, so had continually to shift the same
stuff from one spot to another in order to examine the various
sections o f the floor. It was always in the way, but b y rem oving
it in this manner, and by probing through the debris with an iron
rod, we were able, at 10 a .m ., to form the conclusion that the
sunken well had vanished! It was inexplicable to me, and was
just another Borley mystery. I was so certain as to the exact
position o f the well that I could have found m y way there in the
dark. Actually the cellars were not dark, as some light streamed
through what had once been the hall floor (Plate X I ). I
decided to abandon the search for the well-tank for the time
being, and tackle the round well, which was on the other side
o f the brick partition (see Plan IV ). So with spades and shovels
the diggers began clearing the debris w hich com pletely hid this
well. Fortunately, that had not vanished, and Jackson, with his
C O N T E N T S OF T H E R O U N D W E L L 2 3 9
two feet planted on top o f the rubbish with which it was filled,
began to empty the well. Mrs English took a note o f everything
that was found. ‘ Everything5 consisted mostly o f ashes, broken
tiles, oyster-sheUs,1potsherds, bits o f pottery, fragments o f ancient
two-inch bricks, and the eternal empty wine-bottles.
However, there were other and more interesting things in the
well. A t eighteen inches Jackson came to the water-level— and
young frogs. Myriads o f them ! H e recalled an old Suffolk
superstition that if one puts a live frog on one’s navel it turns
into a sovereign. N o one tried the experiment. Then he handed
up a fine, large, antique brass preserving-pan, with an inner
liner, both pans with handles, one o f which was broken. The
pan was sixteen inches in diameter. Then came more broken
glass, a portion o f a broken brass candlestick, a part o f a small
rusty iron coffer or box— lidless— broken knives, etc.
W hose C ream -jug?
At five feet six inches we came across a real ‘ find.’ (Jackson was
now standing in water, which he was baling out with the preserv­
ing-pan.) As Jackson handed it up I at once recognized it as a
milk- or cream-jug (see Plate X V I), o f good workmanship, chased
and fluted. It measures 4 i inches high, by 3^ inches across the
base. It was as black as ebony and appeared to be made o f silver,
though there are neither hallmarks nor makers’ marks on it. It
stands the acid test for silver, and is, perhaps, a piece o f good-
quality Sheffield plate. That same evening, after dinner at Liston
Rectory, and with the aid o f Mrs Henning’s polishing materiak
— and two hours’ elbow grease— I restored the cream-jug to its
original beauty, and when I had finished with it it might have
come straight from the makers. It was absolutely as new. I
later took it to a firm o f well-known London silversmiths, and
I was informed that it was about eighty years old. They remarked
upon the fact that it bore no identification marks o f any kind.
It would be interesting to know how the jug came to be dropped
— or placed— in the well, and who was the original owner o f it.
1 As wells were often situated in the cellars of monastic buildings, I could not help
wondering whether the shells supported the ‘ monastic foundation* theory. But other
people besides monks are fond of oysters!
T H E END OF B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y

After the discovery o f the cream -jug I was hoping that the
plate, long missing from Borley Church, might be discovered
among the rubbish. But we were disappointed in this respect.
Actually, nothing else o f value or interest was found in the well.
In fact, except for more em pty wine-bottles, etc., and a few inches
o f water, there was nothing in the well at all— except Jackson!
His head had almost disappeared and he was wondering how
he should get out again, when the supply o f half-bricks and
oyster-shells suddenly ran out, and he realized that he was
standing on the bottom o f the well— about six feet deep.
Jackson, with difficulty, continued baling out the water to
enable us to examine the bottom . This was form ed o f bricks,
similar in appearance to those used to build the sides. They
were old bricks, but not the ancient two-inch variety. W e hauled
Jackson out.
W e were now faced with the problem whether we had really
com e to the bottom o f the original well, or to a false bottom
which had been constructed at some period in the past. Without
proper tackle, which was not available, we could not break
through the hard bricks that confronted us. It seems highly
im probable that a well only six feet deep should have been
placed in such a remote part o f the cellar. I f the pit was made
merely for draining the surface water it was (a) in the wrong
place, and (b) too deep for the purpose. W e never solved the
mystery.
W e finished investigating the round bricked well at about
11.30, and then m oved over to the cellar passage once more to
examine the floor. W e could find no trace o f the well-tank, and
I was forced to the conclusion that at some time between 1939
and 1943 one o f the occupants o f the Rectory had rem oved the
tank and had rebricked the aperture to match the surrounding
flooring. I was so seldom at the R ectory during 1937-38, when
I rented the place, that I have no recollection o f seeing the well-
tank during that period. I believe it had been bricked up after
Captain Gregson bought the place— perhaps without his know­
ledge. Neither M r Henning nor Captain Gregson was able to
enlighten me. A minute scrutiny o f the ground where the well
H U M A N R E M A I N S 2 4 1
had been revealed not the slightest sign that the flooring had
been disturbed. The whole o f the cellar was covered with hard,
flat (without hollows or ‘ frogs’ ), semi-glazed bricks (in order to
resist the dam p) o f the ordinary type and size.
Be lo w t h e C e l l a r Flo o r
However, as I was quite positive as to the exact position o f
the old well, we decided to begin digging operations at this
point. It was not at all an easy matter to break through the
flooring, but Jackson, 'with his pickaxe, finally rem oved a few
bricks, and the rest was fairly easy going.
W e found the soil beneath the cellar floor to be o f a hard and
tenacious clayey marl— known locally as cblue vinney5 or ‘ blue
billy.’ Having removed some scores o f bricks, m y helpers got
busy. As M r Henning and Jackson broke up the soil with their
picks others shovelled it out and sifted it.
By 1.45 we had picked and shovelled and sifted some tons o f
marl, and had dug to a depth o f three feet. Mrs English has the
following entry in her notes: '1.45. Jaw -bone (pig?) found.’
Her note records the fact that Jackson had just handed up what
was obviously a jaw -bone o f some animal (with five teeth in situ)
with the remark that it came from a pig. But immediately D r
Bailey saw it he at once said it was human. I did not know to
what animal the bone had belonged. Five minutes later Mrs
English m ade the entry: ‘ 1.50. Part o f skull dug up.’ There
was no mistaking to what {anim al’ this fragment belonged: it
was human. Jackson had shovelled it up with a lot o f broken
clay into the sieve, where it was immediately noted. T he
cavity o f the skull was filled with hard marl, and cutting
this out with a penknife was a delicate business, because the
bone was so brittle. It was found only a few inches from the
jaw -bone.
D r Eric Bailey gave us the following expert opinion o f the
remains: ‘ T he jaw -bone is the left m andible, with five teeth in
good condition, and probably belonged to a woman. T h e other
bone is from the left side o f a human skull and is the parietal
and temporal bone’ (see Plate X V I I I ). W hen he returned to

Sudbury that same evening (August 17, 1943) he w rote to the
Rev. A . C. Henning and confirmed the details in writing.
As we were now very tired (M r Henning and Jackson espe­
cially had been working like niggers), w e all adjourned to the
lawn, at a spot between the famous summer-house and the Nun’s
Walk, and partook o f an alfresco lunch, a really sumptuous meal
kindly provided by Mrs Henning. It was a very jolly party, and
the hot sunny weather was ideal for such a gathering.
W e resumed digging operations soon after three o ’ clock and
worked steadily until five, but no further objects o f importance
were turned up. After Captain Gregson and his nieces had taken
some photographs M r Henning took Mrs English and me back
to Liston Rectory, and the other members o f the party went to
their respective homes or hotels. D r Bailey and his brother and
Flying-Officer Creamer returned to Sudbury.
Though, as I have stated, we turned up nothing o f importance
during the afternoon o f August 17, we found em bedded in the
marl various small objects which were interesting because they
obviously belonged to a period anterior to that in w hich the
Rectory was built. W e discovered one or two whole two-inch
bricks and several pieces that matched those used in the foot­
ings o f the ancient foundation walls w e had already discovered
in another part o f the cellar. W e also found a num ber o f old
potsherds, fragments o f ancient tiles, and bits o f broken clay
pipes, which, I think, were made long before the R ectory was
built in 1863. Unfortunately we failed to unearth either the
6chalice’ or the cmissal’ mentioned in the Planchette scripts.
D ivining f o r C h u rch Plate
Speaking o f the chalice, over dinner that evening at Liston
Rectory, M r Henning told me an interesting story o f how a lady
diviner, Mrs Collett, whom he had called in in an attempt to
find the missing church plate, visited the cellars. Exploring the
various compartments, she suddenly stopped near the site o f the
well-tank; her traditional hazel twig becam e violently agitated
and snapped in two exactly over the area where the hum an
remains and other objects were subsequently found. I must

emphasize that I did not know o f these experiments until after
we had concluded our first day’s digging; so that Mrs Collett’s
experiment did not influence us as to where we should dig.
Also over dinner we discussed the fragments o f skull and jaw ­
bone. These were found almost hard up against the footings or
foundation walls o f the Rectory, near the top end o f the wall to
the right o f the bottom o f the cellar steps, and near the cross
marked on Plan IV . W e agreed that probably, at some time or
other, a complete skeleton lay buried near this spot. And it is
almost certain that the men who built the Rectory, when digging
the foundations, disturbed and scattered the remains. T hey
might not have been aware o f this, as perhaps the bones were
not noticed. O n the other hand, the skeleton may have been
seen and portions o f it removed as souvenirs. M y own opinion
is that other parts o f the skeleton still lie scattered -under the
cellar floor, and that it might take weeks o f digging and m uch
labour to find them. The subsidence in the cellar flooring (under
the ‘ cold spot5) should also be re-dug. As the reader knows, M r
S. H . Glanville and M r M . Kerr-Pearse excavated the ‘ subsi­
dence5on Novem ber i, 1937, and found nothing. But they m ay
not have gone dow n deep enough. They certainly did not dig
three feet, the depth at which all the objects were found. It is
easy for the reader to say that the whole o f the cellar area should
have been dug over. But excavating is a tiring, lengthy, and
expensive business. And those persons best qualified to do it
are busy men, with little leisure for such work, many miles from
their homes. I live a hundred and fifty miles from Borley, so I
know h ow the other enthusiasts must feel about it.
W hen the human remains were found m y helpers raised the
question as to whether the fragment o f skull had any possible
connexion with the complete skull found in the Rectory library
cu pboard by the Rev. G. Eric Smith and his wife during the
first weeks o f M r Smith’s incum bency in 1928. This too was
thought to have belonged to a young woman. It is, o f course,
a m atter for speculation, but I doubt whether a relation between
the tw o skulls can be established.
Before I give an account o f our next day’s digging I will
THE END OF B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y

complete the details we learned about the skull and jaw-bone.
O n m y return to London I submitted (August 19, 1943) both
objects to a West End dental surgeon o f repute. H e too expressed
his opinion that the skull was that o f a youngish person, but that
the fragment was too small to afford sufficient data to determine
the sex o f the owner. As for the age o f it, this was difficult to fix
for the same reason. 'A nything over a hundred years old3
appears to sum up the consensus o f expert opinion. According
to the type o f soil in which organic remains are buried, bones
or similar objects either age and are finally destroyed, or they
are more or less preserved. A lim e clay, such as the subsoil
under Borley Rectory, w ould probably tend to hasten the decay
o f human remains. W e found the skull very decayed, very
brittle, very soft, and rather porous.
A t the first cursory exam ination o f the jaw -bone the dental
surgeon expressed his opinion that it belonged to a youngish
wom an round about the age o f thirty. W hen I cam e to write
the present m onograph I again subm itted the jaw -bone to the
same gentleman, who m ade a careful study o f it and X -rayed
the fragment. He sent me his two reports on M ay 23, 1945. I
w ill take this opportunity o f p ublicly thanking him for devoting
his time, labour, and skill to helping us in our attem pt to throw
some light on the hum an remains found at Borley. H ere are
his two reports:
R eport on Ex t e r n a l A ppe ar a n ce of J a w
General. The fragment consists of all the left side of the lower jaw
from and including the distal wall of the left canine socket. All the
appropriate teeth are present, viz., first and second premolars; first,
second, and third molars. The professional method o f writing
these is /4567s. As a specimen, the condition is good, but the outer
plate o f the first premolar has been lost post mortem.
Dental. The teeth are well formed and free from decay. A fair
amount of tartar is present. /7s are slighdy out of alignment owing
to lack of room for /8. There is well-marked attrition which in­
creases from fl to /6, where it has destroyed the biting surface of
the enamel cap, and then decreases in ¡7 and still more in /8. It
should be remembered that /6 is the oldest tooth of the five and
erupted at six years or earlier. There is some absorption of bone,
R A D I O S C O P I C E X A M I N A T I O N OF J A W 2 4 5
particularly round /6, but not enough to indicate gross paradontal
disease.
Deductions. From the slenderness of the ascending ramus, and
the moderate degree of development of the muscle attachments, I
believe the jaw to be that of a woman. From the condition o f the
teeth and bone, I put the age at death at round about thirty years,
with more probability of its being under than over. T h e diet con­
tained a good amount of roughage and probably some finely
divided grit. I cannot assess with any accuracy the age of the
specimen.
May 23 , 1945 L eslie J . G od d e n
R epo r t on X -R a y A ppearan ce o f J a w
Teeth. The large pulp chambers suggest the lower end of the
probable range of age mentioned in the previous Report. Notice
the loss of the biting surface of the enamel cap in /6, and the calcific
deposits in the pulp chamber.1 The anterior root of ¡6 shows
evidence of infection, very likely arising from the fact that the
anterior horn of the pulp approaches very closely to the denuded
biting surface of the tooth.
Bone. There is a large area below /6, and extending deep into
the jaw, of infected bone. It doubtless arises by spread o f infection
from /6. It is extensive and indicates an infection o f some severity.
It is in close association with the canal which carries the m ain
nerve of the area.
May 23, 1945 L eslie J . G od d e n
T h e dental surgeon took several X -ray films o f the ja w , and
sent me two o f them. I reproduce the better print (Plate X I X ) .
In his covering letter (M ay 23, 1945) remarks:
The condition indicated on both the films I have sent you, and
on those I still have, could be responsible for anything from a
persistent mild ache to any one or any combination o f the following:
a raging toothache; a persistent severe neuralgia; pain in and
anterior to the ear; pain above the eye or down the side o f the nose.
Which of these really occurred, I cannot say; but the fact that the
disease is so deep-seated and is in such close association w ith the
mandibular nerve, does suggest that the owner o f the bone had a
good deal of pain from it.
1 The presence o f these pulp stones, so well defined in a patient relatively so young,
is a point to be noted. Their presence is consistent with the chronic inflammatory
condition to which the tooth was exposed (see X-ray photo).— L. J. G .
2 4 6 T H E END OF B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
The reader will rem ember that those o f our witnesses (and
there are a number o f them) who saw the nun invariably describe
her as ‘ in p a in / or ‘ m iserable/ or with ‘ face d raw n / or with a
‘ pale face/ or ‘ sa d / or ‘ as if she had been crying9
— never as
being happy-looking or laughing. A deep-seated abscess (which
the owner o f our jaw -bone undoubtedly had at time o f death)
could account for the pale and haggard appearance o f the nun.
This is an important point.
Another important point is that the owner o f the ja w was
undoubtedly a young woman. A nd an interesting sidelight is
that her diet ‘ contained a large am ount o f roughage and pro­
bably some finely divided grit.5 This is exactly the sort o f food
that a person, rich or poor, would eat in 1667— the year in which
the ‘ nun5 said she was strangled, when she was aged nineteen.
The simple— even coarse— meals that would be served in con­
ventual establishments, especially to novices, w ould consist
largely o f coarse stone-ground flour or meal m ade into bread
or rough cakes, and these would contain a considerable amount
o f siliceous matter or grit in a fine state.
Second D a y ’s D igging
Immediately after breakfast on the m orning o f August 18,
1943, we resumed excavating the cellars. T he diggers gradually
extended by several square yards the area around the site o f the
well-tank, striking to a depth o f three feet. T he usual potsherds,
broken tiles, and other odds and ends were found, but nothing
interesting was turned up until 11.45, when among the siftings
was noticed a thin oval-shaped piece o f metal, with a loop
attached. W hen the clay was rem oved it was found that the
metal was yellow, slightly discoloured, with a slight green rust or
patina (aerugo). Subsequent examination and testing proved
that the metal was poor-quality gold. It was m uch worn, but
when scrubbed under the pum p traces o f a figure and the word
Pax could be discerned. A few minutes later there was dis­
covered in siftings taken from the same part o f the cellar a small,
thick, ovate plaque, with a loop, two inches long. M rs English
and I scrubbed o ff the clay under the pum p, and it was found

that the plaque was made of copper, coated with a thick green
patina and much corroded and eaten away through long con­
tact with the marl. Removal of some of the patina revealed
inscriptions and figures plainly readable and visible. Obviously,
both the piece of gold metal and the copper plaque were in­
tended as pendants, and bore religious symbols, etc. They will
be discussed in the next chapter.
The diggers worked steadily throughout the day (with a break
for lunch), but found nothing worth recording. A t five o’clock
M r Henning took Mrs English and me back to the Rectory,
where we arrived in time for tea. The other members of the
party went their several ways. Before leaving the Rectory
Captain Gregson very kindly presented me with the large bronze
bell (see Plate X X ) that had, for exactly eighty years, swung in
its cradle high up above the courtyard. It was a nice souvenir
of our visit. Many times— it is alleged— has this bell been rung
paranormally. Dom Richard Whitehouse, O .S.B., records1 how
the bell was rung in daylight on several occasions when he was
there. W ith great difficulty we lowered the bell and its cradle
to the ground, and it now hangs in my garden.
T h ir d D a y ’s D ig g in g
W e left Jackson to clear up the mess in the cellars, but he had
instructions not to replace the marl that had been removed,
as it was our intention to resume digging at an early date. I
returned to London on August 19. A few days later (August 30,
1943) M r Sidney H . Glanville, his son, Squadron-Leader R . H .
Glanville, the Rev. A . C. Henning, Mrs Henning, Jackson, and
myself again visited the Rectory cellars and had a day’s digging.
Nothing of interest was discovered, and the marl and bricks
were replaced— not very neatly, I am afraid (see Plate X X I).
Thus ended (at least for the time being) our investigation of the
Rectory cellars. Before we left M r S. H . Glanville made a plan
of the cellars. Those interested in photography might like to
know that the pictures of M r Henning and Jackson digging,
Liston Rectory, and one or two moreillustrations that I reproduce

were taken on an ‘ Agfa’ film-pack ten years old. Failing to
obtain a new pack of any make, I decided— with some trepida­
tion— to risk using one I had by me, and the film proved to be
as good as new.
Did we find ‘ truth’ at the bottom of a well? Were the human
remains those of the ill-fated ‘ Marie Lairre’ ? Had the religious
pendants any conceivable connexion with ‘ M arie’ or the ‘ Borley
mystery’ ? It is impossible, of course, fully to answer these ques­
tions; but the reader, when he has finished this volume, will
doubtless be able to decide for himself.
There is still one more possibility that I have not mentioned.
As I have recorded in Chapter I, M r Glanville and his son dis­
covered (August 14, 1937) that the ‘ cats’ cemetery,’ in a remote
and unfrequented part of the Rectory grounds, had been dis­
turbed. It had been dug over, and the headboards scattered.
Some one had expended much time and labour— for what
purpose? No one knows. Had something— or the remains of
some one— been disinterred, or had something been buried? In­
quiries by the Glanvilles and myselfthrew no light on the mystery.
On August 28, 1937, the Glanvilles, in an attempt to solve
the puzzle, dug over the large patch of ground that had been
surreptitiously disturbed. They hoped to find something. They
did— they ‘ turned up a lot of large bones that certainly never
formed part of the anatomy of a c a t. . . but one or two of them
they could not identify.’ 1 Were they human?
Whether we accept or reject the ‘ table-tipping’ and/or
Planchette messages, it is a fact that in several of them the sitters
were told that ‘ Marie Lairre’s’ bones were ‘ in the garden,’ and
in one of them that they had been removed to the cellar. For
example, in Chapter V III (the ‘ Locked Book’ ) the sitters were
informed (by ‘ table-tipping’, October 24, 1937) that the nun’s
remains were in the garden; also, that only the nun’s bones were
there. They were ‘ under a large tree,’ ‘ under trees,’ ‘ near the
path,’ etc. On October 30, 1937, the Rev. A . C. Henning and
M r S. H . Glanville were informed (Planchette), by the alleged
nun herself, that she had been buried in the garden.
1 The Most Haunted House in England. p. 199.
HUMAN BONES IN THE ‘ C A T S 5 C E M E T E R Y 5? 249
In the new scripts (Planchette) w hich I received w hen this
book was h alf com pleted I discovered that, w ith M iss G lanville
and her brother as sitters, an entity w ho called him self ‘ H enry5
w rote (D ecem ber 19, 1937) that ‘ under the cellarfloor will befound
heap o f bonesfrom the garden and the pond? Asked whose bones they
w ere, ‘ H enry5 said ‘ Lairre.5 (See facsim ile o f w riting, p. 226.)
So now w e have the definite statements that M ary Lairre’ s
bones had been rem oved from the garden and— by im plication—
reburied under the cellar flooring.
T he ‘ cats5 cem etery1 is near the pond (or, as it is som etim es
called, the stream, according to the season o f the year: see plan
o f grou nds); it is ‘ under trees,5‘ near the path 5 (now overgrow n),
etc. So is it not possible that som e o f the bones that M r G lanville
dug up, but could not identify, were, in fact, hum an? Perhaps
part o f the skeleton o f M arie Lairre, fragm ents o f w hich w e
found under the cellar floor? It is conceivable that som e o f the
nun’s rem ains were rem oved from that part o f the garden w hich,
in very w et weather, form s a sort o f pond, and were reburied
under the cellar— as Planchette revealed. U nfortunately, none
o f the bones that M r G lanville found was preserved.
In m y The M ost Haunted House in England (p. 26) I rem ark
that ‘ A portion o f the garden o f Borley R ectory is the site o f the
burial place o f some o f the victim s o f the G reat Plague w hich
ravaged England in 1654-55.’ This inform ation was given to m e
in good frith , but I now believe the story to be little m ore than
a tradition. But, assuming there was such a pit in the R ectory
garden, it is conceivable that all the hum an rem ains found at
Borley by us and others originated there. U nfortunately the
C hurch registeis record no deaths before 1656, so w e do not
know how m any— if any— villagers died o f the plague.
CHAPTER XV
‘ THE M IRACULOUS M EDAL’
A F T E R dinner at Liston R ectory on the evening o f August 18,
1943, we once m ore turned our attention to the m orning’s
discoverieSj especially the patinated plaque. This w e again
scrubbed, rem oving m ost o f the green patina. T he lettering and
religious symbols were now quite visible, and we cou ld make out
the follow ing inscriptions, etc. O bverse : the V irgin M ary, full
length, crushing the head o f the serpent under her feet. Rays of
light issue from her fingers and fall on a terrestrial globe on which
she is standing, the w hole surrounded by stars. R ound the peri­
phery o f the plaque is the follow ing invocation : ‘ O M ary,
C onceived W ithout Sin, Pray for Us W ho H ave R ecourse to
T hee.’ O n the reverse o f the plaque is the m onogram ‘ M ’ (for
M ary) with tw o hearts, surrounded by tw elve stars. O ne o f the
hearts is pierced with a sw ord. In the field o f the plaque are
twelve stars.
T he R ev. A . C . H enning, after a careful exam ination o f the
plaque, suggested that the stars m ay represent the tw elve tribes
o f Israel, including that o f Judah, o f w hich M ary was a descen­
dant. T he rays from her hands are obviously healing rays.
T he pierced heart m ay be sym bolic o f the words o f Simeon
(Luke ii, 3 5 ): ‘ Y ea, a sw ord shall pierce through thy ow n soul
also, that the thoughts o f m any hearts m ay be revealed,’ and
refers to our L ord’s suffering on the Cross, and the suffering o f
His M other, M ary. M r H enning also suggested that the twelve
stars w ere those o f the W om an o f the A pocalypse, as recorded
in R evelation xii, 1: ‘ A nd there appeared a great w onder in
heaven; a w om an clothed w ith the sun, and the m oon under her
feet, and upon her head a crow n o f twelve stars.’
As for the small gold pendant, M r H enning cou ld say little
about that as it is so m uch w orn and corroded ow ing to the low
250
S T O R Y O F Z O E L A B O U R É 25I
quality of the metal. But on the obverse can be seen faintly the
figure of the Virgin, with the word 'P ax5 underneath. On the
reverse are religious symbols, including twelve stars.
When I returned to London I visited (August 25, 1943)
Westminster Cathedral and saw the Rev. Father M . J. Moriarty,
who gave me his opinion concerning the plaques. He at once
recognized the larger one as a specimen of the 'Miraculous
M edal,5the history of Which I will give later. He kindly loaned
me a pamphlet, The Miraculous Medal and Blessed Catherine
Labouré,1 in which is a full account of how these medals came
to be struck. It is an interesting story. Father Moriarty could
not, of course, give me any information concerning the particular
specimen of the 'Miraculous M edal5 that I showed him. He
had never seen one exactly like it, and thought that most of
these pendants were struck in France. As for the gold pendant,
he had never seen one like it, and it was quite unknown in this
country. He said it is undoubtedly of foreign make, and pro­
bably French. It is very old.
When I left Father Moriarty I called on Messrs Maurice
Vanpoulle, the church furnishers and Roman Catholic medal­
lists, of Vauxhall Bridge Road, London, S .W .i, who confirmed
what Father Moriarty had told me. They said the copper
plaque was about sixty years old, and the gold pendant was
much older. They had never seen another specimen, and it was
probably French. Both pendants were often attached to rosaries
as worn by nuns. I will now quote from the pamphlet I received
from Father Moriarty and relate how Zoë Labouré, afterwards
the Blessed Catherine Labouré, received instructions, direct from
the mouth of the Virgin M ary, for the striking of a medallion
recording the visions seen by Catherine on three occasions in the
year 1830. Here, then, is
TH E STO R Y OF TH E M IR A C U LO U S M EDAL
Zoë Labouré was bom in 1806 in the small village of Fain-les-
Moûtiers, in the Department of the Côte-d5
Or, France. She
was one of a family of seven sons and three daughters. Her
1Published by the Sisters of Charity, St Vincent’s, Dublin («. d.).
252 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
parents were simple and devout Catholics, who lived a frugal
and laborious life cultivating their little farm. Zoe was a good
girl, and when, at the age of eight, she lost her mother the child
felt ‘ that henceforth Our Lady might be her Mother.’ At the
age of twelve Zoe made her first Communion. As her eldest
sister had become a Sister of Charity, on Zoe fell the charge of
managing the household. She cooked for the family, carried the
food to the workers in the fields, and performed with fidelity the
many tasks that such a large family entailed.
Zoe was very fond of pets, especially pigeons, of which there
were between seven and eight hundred on the farm. Her
especial delight was the care of the pigeon-house, and the birds
loved her. ‘ They knew her and she knew them, and as if they
realized the purity of her heart and the great things God had in
store for her, they came when she appeared, as her sister des­
cribed it, circling round her in the form of a crown.’ From her
earliest childhood she fasted on Fridays and Saturdays, and heard
Mass daily at an early hour, ‘ kneeling without support on the
cold pavement, even in the frosts of winter.’
A t the age of eighteen, through neglect of her education, Zoe,
we are told, could hardly read or write. But she had a strange
dream: she dreamt that she was in the village church, where
she saw an aged priest saying Mass. When it was over the priest
called her to come to him, but, being frightened, she drew back.
She left the church and entered one of the houses in the village
to visit a sick person. Again she saw the aged priest, who said
to her: ‘ M y daughter, you do well to take care of the sick. You
shrink from me now, but one day you will be eager to come to
me. God has great designs in your regard.’ Then she woke up.
But her dream had so impressed her that she prevailed on her
father to allow her to go and stay at Chatillon-sur-Seine (readers
will recollect that it was the Congress of Chatillon, in 1814,
which pronounced the deposition of Napoleon I), where her
sister-in-law was a schoolmistress. One day, when visiting the
Sisters of Charity in the neighbourhood, ‘ she was struck by the
sight of a. picture that was an exact portrait of the priest of her
dream.’ When, on asking who it was, she heard it was St
V I S I O N O F S T V I N C E N T 253
Vincent, 'G od’s purpose became manifest3
— she was to become
a Sister of Charity.
Zoë was six years trying to persuade her father to permit her
to join the Sisters at Chatillon, but at last he consented, and she
entered as a postulant. A few months later, in April 1830, she
was received into the novitiate, at the Mother House in the Rue
du Bac, Paris. 'Then straightaway began the series of heavenly
apparitions which God granted to this chosen soul.5
V ision o f t h e H e a r t
It happened that on April 25 of this year— 1830— occurred
the solemn translation of the relics of St Vincent-de-Paul. His
remains had been hidden from the fury of the mob during the
French Revolution of 1790, and it was decided to restore them
to their place over the high altar of the Central House1 of the
Vincentians in the Rue de Sèvres. Three days before this cere­
mony took place Sister Catherine (as she was now called) saw
her first vision. She says: 'I asked St Vincent to obtain for me
all the graces I needed. . . . In the chapel of the Sisters I had the
consolation of seeing St Vincent’s heart above the little shrine
where the relics are exposed. It appeared to me three consecu­
tive days, each time in a different manner.3 Simply and candidly
she disclosed these visions to her Confessor, Father Aladel, a
holy and prudent Vincentian. He, fearing deception, advised
her to dismiss them from her mind, and told her not to speak of
them to any person.
T h e F ir s t A p p a r it io n
On the night ofJuly 18, 1830, she was awakened from sleep by a
voice calling her by her name, and she saw by the side of her bed
a beautiful child about five years old, dressedin white, and shedding
forth a light that fell on everything with a lovely radiance. Quietly
he spoke to her, ' Come to the Chapel, the Blessed Virgin is waiting

Entering the Chapel, she saw the candles on the altar lighted as if
for m id n ig h t Mass. At the same moment Sister Catherine heard a
slight noise like the rustling of a silk dress. Then a beautiful lady
entered and seated herself on the left side of the sanctuary, in the

place usually, occupied by the Director of the Community. She
wore a yellow dress and blue cloak.
T he V irgin spoke to her and, anticipating the rising o f the
Com m une, said, ‘ T h e A rchbishop w ill die and the streets of
Paris w ill run with b lood .’ This prognostication was eventually
fulfilled, the A rchbishop G eorge D arboy, w ith m any o f his
priests, being shot by the leaders o f the revolt.
T h e S e c o n d A p p a r it io n
O n N ovem ber 27, 1830, Sister Catherine again saw the Virgin
M ary, at 5.30 in the evening, in the C hapel:
She was dressed in a gold-coloured gown, very plain high-
necked, with flat sleeves. Her head was covered with a white veil,
which floated over her shoulders down to her feet. Her hair Was
parted and confined in a sort of fillet trimmed with narrow lace.
Her feet rested on a globe. Her hands, on a level with her waist,
held another globe. . . . Suddenly her fingers were covered with
rings of precious stones. Rays of dazzling light darted from ther^
and the whole of her figure was enveloped in such radiance that
her feet and dress were no longer visible.
The V irgin told Sister Catherine that the globe on w hich her
feet rested represented the w orld.
After a. while an oval frame surrounded the Blessed Virgin on
which was written in gold letters: ‘ O Mary, conceived without sin,
pray for us who have recourse to Thee.’ Then a voice said to me,
‘ Get a medal struck after this model; those who wear it when it is
blessed will receive great graces, especially if they wear it round
their necks. Graces will abound for those who have confidence.’
Then the oval fram e slow ly revolved, and on the back o f it was
the letter ‘ M ,’ surm ounted by a cross w ith a crossbar beneath it,
‘ and under the letter the H oly Hearts o f Jesus and His M other;
the first surrounded by a crow n o f thorns, the second pierced by
a sw ord.’ A gain her Confessor was sceptical and told Sister
Catherine not to believe in the things she said she saw.
T h e T h ir d A p p a r it io n
W ithin a few weeks, and again at the evening m editation, the
V irgin appeared to Sister Catherine for the third tim e. This
B E A T I F I C A T I O N O F Z O E 2 5 5
time Our Lady, looking about forty years old, stood above the
tabernacle. Once more she received the order to get the medal
struck according to the model she had seen. Her Confessor,
Father Aladel, was becoming less sceptical, but moved cautiously
in the matter: ‘He tested her to assure himself of the veracity of
her statements, and sought the advice of many competent per­
sons/ Being finally convinced that his penitent really did see
the apparitions, he obtained the approval of the Archbishop of
Paris, and the first "Miraculous M edal5 was struck in the same
city two years later— in 1832. Statues of the visions were also
made.
Catherine Labouré died on December 31, 1876, aged seventy.
In M ay 1933 she was beatified, and it is part of the process of
beatification that the body of the Saint be exhumed and
examined by the ecclesiastical authorities:
When her coffin was opened the body of the Blessed Catherine
was found incorrupt and most wonderfully preserved. Only where
the comette (Sisters of Charity are buried in their habits) touched
the face, and where the habit touched one hand, was there any
discoloration; and these marks on the face and hand were re­
moved easily by washing. The body was just as it was when she
died. Two old women, who were once children under her charge,
at once recognized the body as that of Sister Catherine.
Her remains now rest in the Chapel of the Mother House o f the
Sisters of Charity in the Rue du Bac, Paris.
The beatification of Sister Catherine took place at St Peter’s,
Rome, on M ay 28, 1933, by Pope Pius X I. The ceremony must
have been impressive:
There were present on the morning of that day in the vast
Basilica of St Peter’s, with kings and princes and presidents of
states, eight thousand children of Mary Immaculate whom the
Holy Father likened to "a shower of snow fallen from heaven5;
three thousand Sisters of Charity came from the ends of the earth.
Cardinals, bishops, and priests without number, and twenty-
three relatives of Catherine also attended.
Many miracles have been credited to the ‘ Miraculous M ed al/
and many miraculous cures have been claimed by its wearers.
256 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
The conversion of Alphonsus Ratisbonne, the Jew, was, it is
stated, due to his wearing a ‘ Miraculous M edal.’ A friend gave
him one and, while wearing it, he entered (February 13, 1842)
the Church of Saint Andrea della Valle, Rome. He, too, saw a
vision. He said: ‘ I lifted my eyes . . . and, standing on the altar,
tall, radiant, full of majesty and sweetness, appeared the Blessed
Virgin Mary, such as she is on this medal. She did not speak,
but I understood everything.’
Speaking of ‘ cures,’ I can record a curious coincidence. On
August 7, 1943, was published (in Everybody's Weekly) an article
on Borley Rectory that I had written. On the same day a corre­
spondent wrote to me about the article and his private affairs. A
Roman Catholic priest advised him to wear a medal of ‘ the
Blessed Catherine Laboure.’ He did so, and he says in his letter:
‘ I think my personal affairs are better.’ I must admit that I had
never heard of Sister Catherine, or her medal. Eleven days later,
at Borley, one is found. But everything connected with Borley is
strange.
W h o L o st t h e P e n d a n t s ?
I have dwelt on the ‘ Miraculous M edal’ at some length
because (a) the story is intrinsically interesting; (b) the alleged
miraculous origin of these plaques is also interesting; and (c) the
fact that one was found under the ‘ house of miracles’ at Borley is
truly remarkable. And now a number ofquestionspresent them­
selves. To whom did the plaques belong? How did they become
buried? When were they buried? What age are the plaques?
I think that some of these questions can be answered satisfac­
torily. First of all, it is remarkable that both the copper plaque
and silver cream-jug were made about the same time as the
Rectory was built— i.e., 1863. W e cannot be certain about this,
to a few years, but expert opinion gives the plaque as being
‘ about sixty years old,’ though the cream-jug may be some
twenty years older.
W hat is quite certain is that the plaque is at least as old as the
Rectory, which was built over eighty years ago, and probably a
little older; and I think that it, and the thin gold pendant, were
dropped— and lost— by the Italian workmen whom the Rev.
W H E N T H E R E C T O R Y W A S B U I L T 257
Henry Bull employed to fix the fine Italian marble mantelpieces
in the Rectory which is reproduced in Plate IV of The Most
Haunted House in England. We do not know how long these men
were working on the Rectory; whether they were brought over
from Italy for the purpose, or whether they were travelling
journeymen who happened to be in the neighbourhood. It is
certain that they did work in the dining- and drawing-rooms,
erecting the mantelpieces, and they may have worked on the
foundations too. I think that it cannot be questioned that the
plaques were lost when the foundations and the cellars of the
Rectory were being built. The small, thin gold pendant may
have hung on a w
’atch-chain. I have lost more than one ccharm5
in this way myself. The larger, copper pendant may have been
suspended on a cord round a man’s neck next to his flesh (as
recommended by the Catholic Church). Nothing is more likely
than that, in digging the foundations, the cord snapped and the
plaque slipped down the man’s clothes into the marl and was
irretrievably lost. He would probably not discover his loss until
he undressed at night, and the chance of his finding it the next
day would be remote.
Upon my first examination of the Rectory, on June 12, 1929,
my secretary and I crept along the joists under the eaves and
we came across the following inscription painted on one of the
rafters to which the bell levers were anchored: 4Bells hung by
S. Cracknell and Mercur, 1863.51 It was an interesting discovery
as it gave us the exact date when the house was built. Previously,
no one seemed to be quite sure as to when it was built. Now,
Mercur is a very uncommon name (I can find only one entry in
the London Telephone Directory), and it occurs to me that it
might be Italian. More probably it is of French origin, as there
is— or was— a famous French noble family, the Seigneurs and
Dukes of Mercoeur. In fact, one of them— Philippe-Emmanuel
de Lorraine, Due de Mercoeur (1558-1602)— had himself pro­
claimed Protector of the Roman Catholic Church in 1588. I
understand that the mining township of Mercur, in Utah,
U .S .A ., was named after this family.

T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y

"M ercur9may be a corruption of "Mercoeur,9and if the name
was transplanted to England the anglicization of the word would
be swift and inevitable. So I suggest that at least one of the
"Italian5workmen may have been a Frenchman named Mercur,
and that it was he who lost the pendants. Undoubtedly the loser
was a Roman Catholic, and the pendants are almost certainly of
French workmanship. Mercur may have bought the pendants
in this country, though they were manufactured in France, one
with English lettering, for use by British nuns. Or he may have
procured them abroad. There is nothing extraordinary in a man
wearing such pendants, especially if Mercur was a devout
Catholic and belonged to one of the Latin races. There is a
possibility, ofcourse, that the pendants never belonged to Mercur
at all, but were the property of one of the men— perhaps an
Italian or Irishman— who helped to dig out the cellars. Inciden­
tally, Sister Catherine Labouré was still living when the pen­
dants were lost. She died thirteen years after the Rectory was
built.
One thing is quite certain— the copper pendant has no direct
connexion with "Marie Lairre9 of the Planchette scripts (it will
be remembered that she alleged she died in 1667) or with the
human remains found near it, which undoubtedly are much
more ancient. The copper plaque and the gold pendant may
have been "pointers9 or "indicators9 only. As for the latter
object, it seems impossible to fix a date as to when it was made,
but it was probably lost at the same time as the plaque. And it
probably belonged to the same person. If so, then it is doubtful
if it was the property of "Marie Lairre,9 if she ever existed. But
that is a possibility that cannot be ruled out, and as it was found
near the fragment of skull, the owner of the skull might also
have been the owner of the pendant. If so, it would undoubtedly
have been worn round the neck. In this connexion it is interest­
ing to compare my speculations (in the absence of concretefacts3
we can do nothing but speculate; and if we do not speculate we
shall get nowhere) with Lieutenant Ian Aitchison9
s psychometric
impressions of the "exhibits9 recorded in Chapter X V II.
W ell, that is all I can say about the pendants, except to record
A N O T H E R ‘ V I R G I N 5 M E D A L F O U N D 2 5 9
that it was not the first time that a copper medallion, bearing
the figure of the Virgin Mary, had been dug up in strange
circumstances and in a strange place. In Notes and Queries1 is
recorded the finding of a similar object. It is an ancient seal,
the size of a penny, but twice as thick. The design shows
a monk kneeling before the Virgin and Child, with the legend,
‘ fS . JORDANIS M ON ACH I SPALDINGIE.5 It was found
buried under six feet o f chalk on the slopes of the Western Heights
on the Bredenstone, near Dover. The Bredenstone is where the
ceremony of installing the Lord Wardens of the Cinque Ports
used to take place. The seal is, perhaps, that of Spalding Priory,
Lincolnshire, established in 1051. As Spalding is more than a
hundred and fifty miles from Dover, the question arises, how
did it get there? More especially, how came it to be buried
under six feet of chalk? This point was raised in Notes and Queries
and never answered satisfactorily. The seal is— or was— in the
possession of M r H. S. Boyton, St Martin’s Place, Dover.

NEW LIG H T ON TH E BO RLEY H AU N T
By the R e v . C a n o n W . J. P h y t h ia n -A d a m s, d .d .
[Upon my return from Borley in August 1943 I informed Dr
Phythian-Adams o f the results o f our excavations at the Rectory,
and asked him to comment upon them. H e kindly consented, and his
remarks are printed herewith. In his essay he has taken the oppor­
tunity o f giving his views o f the theory that Arabella Waldegrave is
the nun-ghost.— H . P .]
T H E striking discoveries m ade b y M r H arry P rice and his
friends in August 1943 take us a long step forw ard towards
the elucidation o f the m ystery. A t his request I set dow n what
seem to m e the necessary inferences to be draw n from the new
data, in w hich I include w ith thankfulness the invaluable
researches o f M rs G eorgina D aw son into the past history of
Borley and the W aldegraves. I propose to exam ine the problem
afresh under tw o headings: The Scene o f the Murder, and The
Identity o f the Victim.
I. The Scene o f the Murder. T h e rem ains o f the victim were
found by M r Price and his helpers three feet down under the exist­
ing cellarfloor where the ‘ tank,’ cleared by M r K err-Pearse and
covered later w ith a hatch-cover by Captain G regson, had been
inserted into this floor. I am not at the m om ent concerned with
this rem arkable confirm ation o f the wall-m essage, ‘ W ell-tank-
bottom -m e,’ but it is necessary to poin t out that there never
actually was a filled-in w ell beneath this ‘ tank,’ as M r Price
supposed.1 T he w ell and the tank were in different places. But
the tank, being covered over, looked like a well, so the message
was adm irably designed to lead us to this spot. W hat the ‘ tank’
was for I cannot im agine, but as it was lined w ith sm ooth

A C L E R I C A L C R I M E ? 261
concrete1 it must have been of comparatively recent date, and
this difficulty need not therefore delay us.
The point I wish to stress is the position of the remains below a
cellar floor, because this makes it obvious that such a cellar
existed2 before the crime was committed, and this means that
a house of some kind must have been standing on the site in the
seventeenth or early eighteenth century. What, then, was this
house? Mrs Dawson tells us that old maps (but how old?) show
only two houses at Borley; the H allz which was the seat of the
Lords of the Manor and stood beside the river Stour, and the
Place in its present position opposite the Rectory. She suggests,
I think with reason, that since ‘ it is certain that there was a
rectory at Borley in the sixteenth century,9 it would ‘ most
probably be on the site of the present building.9 Later it appar­
ently fell into decay and was replaced by another rectory which
was occupied, inter alios, by the Herringhams; and finally the
present, now gutted, building was erected by the Rev. H . D. Bull.
It would appear, then, first, that there never was a Waldegrave
Manor on this site, as was very reasonably suggested by M r Price.
The ‘ M anor9house was Borley Place; and the seat of the Lords
of the Manor, the Waldegraves, was Borley Hall. Secondly, if
our assumption is correct, the only building which has ever
occupied this site has been a rectory. Are we, then, faced with a
clerical crime, or at least with one committed with the full
knowledge and connivance of the contemporary rector? W e
cannot exclude this possibility, for even the Church has her black
sheep; but in so small a community detection— or at the very
least grave suspicion, not to mention scandal— could scarcely
have been evaded, and th ecnun9seems to have walked about the
garden quite openly. No one, moreover, is likely to welcome
having the corpse of a murdered girl buried only three feet down
under his cellar floor, and if he was the actual murderer he would
1O r it may have been lined with stone. As I state in Chapter X IV , the ‘ well*
may have been used for catching the surface water.— H. P.
2The foundation walls o f these cellars have been found (see Ghapter X IV ). They
were built o f two-inch bricks, proving that they were constructed some time before
1625. See note concerning these bricks at foot o f p. 234.— H . P.

be still less anxious to take so desperate a step. (I am speaking,
of course, of the country, not of the town.) We must conclude,
I think, that the rector of the time knew nothing about the
murder, and this can only mean that he was not then occupying
the Rectory, and was, indeed, in all probability not living at
Borley at all.
It is here that I seem to find considerable significance in the
notes compiled by Mrs Dawson on the Rectors of Borley (twenty).
In 1660 a certain William Playne was appointed Rector by
Philip Waldegrave per curatores (the patron being not of age?),
but in 1662 he went to Langenhoo, another incumbency in the gift
of the Waldegraves. He died in 1680, still Rector of Borley, and
was succeeded by Thomas Muriell, who also went to Langenhoo (in
1681), though he was ‘ still officially at Borley* in 1700. For
some reason the patronage was at this time in the hands of a
certain John Fanshaw, who in 1700 appointed Robert Gooding
to officiate at Borley, though he had ‘ no seat’ there. Muriell
died in 1709 and was succeeded in the regular way by Robert
Goodwin, the patron being again Philip Waldegrave. Goodwin
on his death in 1719 was succeeded by F. Perry (patron, Charles,
Duke of Somerset, and Trinity College, Cambridge); and he
too, though he lived till 1758 as Rector of Borley, cannot have
resided there, for his work appears to have been done by
Humphrey Burroughs from 1721 to 1757. Then on Perry’s
death (1758) Robert Morton was appointed Rector by James,
Earl Waldegrave, but he also seems to have lived elsewhere (at
Langenhoo, which he held from 1744); and the King’s books
give the value of the Rectory as nil. After this there is a long
blank, till in 1808-09 the Ecclesiastical Index shows Borley
Rectory as valued at £ 9 . Finally, in 1841 comes the first of the
two Herringhams.
Apparently, then, from 1662 to some unknown date at the
end of the eighteenth or the beginning of the nineteenth cen­
tury the Rectory at Borley was either untenanted or occupied
•by some one other than the rector. The fact that it ultimately
became uninhabitable and valueless suggests that the former
hypothesis is the correct one; but this would not preclude the
T H E V I C T I M W A S F R E N C H 263
possibility of its being used for some time after 1662 for more
secular purposes— for the lodging, let us say, of some one brought
over from France! And i f it were known that the house would there­
after remain unoccupied there would be no serious risk in a grave beneath
the cellarfloor. Here, I admit, we are on delicate ground, but I
must point out that it is at least a singular thing that both
William Playne (1662) and Thomas Muriell (1681) were trans­
ferred to Langenhoo, so that for the space of some fifty years, if
not more, the Rectory could have remained untenanted. Who
the curatores were who acted for the young Waldegrave, and
whether Fanshaw was one of them, I do not know; but since
Langenhoo was in the Waldegrave gift, both they and he must
have represented the interests of the family. If, then, a
Waldegrave was responsible for the crime their action in trans­
planting these two rectors may assume a sinister significance
(though the suggestion may have come from only one of them).
By the time the locum terms Gooding was appointed the house
had apparently ceased to be habitable, so that whatever secrets
it concealed might be considered safe for ever. (Where Robert
Goodwin lived appears to be unknown. Is it possible that he
was the Robert Goodwyn who was Rector o f Liston in 1700, and
that he combined the two parishes, as the present Rector does,
from Liston Rectory?)
II. The Identity o f the Victim. M y original suggestion about this
was that we ought to accept provisionally the unsought and
unexpected information given by Planchette to Miss Helen
Glanville and later supplemented to her, her father and brother,
and M r Kerr-Pearse.1 The first message purported to give the
name of the victim as Mary Lairre (or Larire or Larre), a novice
who ‘passed over5 on May 17, 1667, and whose convent was
cHaiv.5 The second message confirmed the date 1667, and added
that Mary was French and that she was strangled by (or more
strictly through the ‘ fault5of) a Waldegrave. Her convent was
now given as ‘ Havre.5
Since then Mrs Dawson, in the course of her researches into
the history of the Waldegrave family, has made a most interesting
1The Most Haunted House in England, pp. 1
60- 162.
T H E E N D OF B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
264
and exciting suggestion which, if true, completely rules out this
‘ disclosure.5 She suggests that the Borley ‘ nun5 is Arabella
Waldegrave, the daughter of Henrietta, wife of Henry (?)}i
Baron Waldegrave of Ghewton, and the granddaughter (through
her mother) of Arabella Churchill and King James II. Arabella
was born in 1687, was taken by her parents to France in 1688,
and at the age of seven (in 1694) was entered as a pupil at the
Benedictine Convent of Pontoise. For a time it was thought that
nothing more was to be heard of her after this, but Mrs Dawson
has now found out that she entered the novitiate, not at Pontoise
(which is curious, because her aunt, Dame Ignatia, was a nun
there at this time) but at some convent in Paris (possibly the
Blue Nuns or the stricter Benedictine filiation from Cambrai,
both of them English Houses). Later on, Mrs Dawson suggests,
she became a spy, either for James II or for the English Court,
and her activities became so dangerous to one or other of these
parties that she had to be murdered— at Borley.
This is a most attractive hypothesis, and it has much at first
sight to commend it. Arabella was a Waldegrave, Borley was
the seat of Philip Waldegrave, her kinsman. Must not these
two facts be connected? Furthermore, Henrietta, Arabella’s
mother, was expelled from the French Court on the charge of
spying against James II. M ay not Arabella herself have taken
to espionage? But let us reflect a moment. I f Arabella dis­
appeared when she was in the novitiate she must have been still
a mere girl. Arabella (Ignatia) Fitzjames, her aunt, became a
novice at Pontoise at the age of fifteen, and it is probable that
Arabella herselfwould do much the same. But, even if she were
a few years older than this, could she at such an age have become
a spy; and not only that, but a spy of such importance that her
enemies thought it wise to murder her?
Once again, why was she murdered at Borley? Her kinsman,
Philip Waldegrave, was a staunch Roman Catholic. (So, in
spite of all that had happened, was her mother.) How came it
1Gollinson {History and Antiquities of the County of Somerset, 1791, ii, 117) gives
Charles, not Henry, and says that he was the eldest son of Sir Henry Waldegrave,
Bart. {d. Oct, 10, 1658), who was twice married and had thirteen sons and ten
daughters!
T H E D I S A P P E A R A N C E OF A R A B E L L A 2 6 5
about, then, that he allowed her to be quietly disposed of with­
out raising a hue and cry? Is it suggested that she was spying
upon him> and that he found it necessary to remove her? But
this could only be because she had abandoned her religion and
we know that she had not done so. The Borley WTitings asked for
'light Mass [requiem] and prayers9; the Borley victim wore a
Roman Catholic medallion.1 We can dismiss at onee any idea
that, if it was Arabella, she had taken service with a Protestant
Government.
It will not do. One can imagine Arabella visiting the
Waldegraves of Borley. One can even imagine her on a secret
but unimportant mission. But that she should be done to death
in what must have been the safest place for her in England, and
that she should have been buried, of all places, under the cellar
floor of Borley Rectory— this is too much to believe!
What became of her, then? How is it that this girl of noble
birth and royal blood seems to have vanished without trace?
Where one guess is as good as another, I make no apology for
offering my own. It is not an exciting explanation: in fact, it is
as old as the hills. It is that the 'mystery5 of Arabella can be
summed up as a young manl Consider the position: Here we
have a schoolgirl brought up rather like Miss Twinkleton’s
young ladies, but, unlike them, with the prospect, piously en­
couraged by her family, of spending the remainder of her life
within the walls of the Academy. I f she is Arabella Churchill’s
granddaughter she may well feel other stirrings within her, and
as she is not yet immured, a clandestine flirtation is still possible.
It is discovered. General horror! Not only a young man, but
from the Waldegrave point of view a most undesirable one!
Speedy action follows. Arabella must be removed from this
temptation, and the only way to do this is to remove her from
Pontoise. So she is carried off to one of the English Houses in
Paris, possibly the stricter Benedictine convent which was a
filiation from Cambrai. There she continues to 'test her voca­
tion,5 and in due course enters the novitiate. But the stratagem
fails. Where one can go another can follow; and where there is
1The thin gold pendant.— H. P.
266 T H E END OF B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
a will there is a way of escape. Arabella vanishes with her un­
desirable lover, and from that day, so far as both her family and
her convent are concerned, she is dead.
This explanation may be quite wrong, but I put it forward to
show that there need be no very great mystery about the dis­
appearance even of a Waldegrave! Such a family ‘ disgrace*
(which may have been simply a mésalliance) would have been
quite enough to consign the offender to oblivion; and I suspect
that the convents of those days could have told many such a
story, had they been willing to do so.
But whatever Arabella’s fate may have been, it is (I submit)
irrelevant to our present problem. So far I have been using
general arguments, and I have cited only one piece of evidence
from Borley itself. Now that evidence, as we have seen, shows
that the victim was a Roman Catholic, but it also shows much
more than this; it shows that she was French. For consider: we
have the French medallion ‘ apports’ (and now the French medal­
lion in the grave). W e have the broken-English messages:
‘ Please help get,’ ‘ Light Mass and Prayers,’ ‘ W ell, tank,
bottom, m e’ ; and side by side with these we have the word
‘ trompée’ written in the flowing hand of one who is using her
own language. Finally (though this certainly sounds fantastic),
we cannot ignore the story, reported to M r Price since he wrote
his book, of the disappearance and return of a French (French-
English) dictionary!1
But is this conclusive against Arabella? For a time I felt
constrained to admit that it might not be. If Arabella was
brought to France at the age of one and put to school at seven in
a French convent would she not grow up with more knowledge of
the French language than of her own? It seemed that the possi­
bility, however unlikely, could not be excluded, till I learned
from Mrs Dawson’s notes that the convent at Pontoise, though on
French soil, was actually a branch of an English House trans­
planted to the Continent from England at the time of the
Reformation. The nuns were English, the school was English:
that is precisely why Arabella was sent there ! In fact, so far as
1 See M r P. Shaw Jeffrey’s experiences, related in Chapter V I.— H. P.
A T R U L Y HUMAN S T O R Y 267
I can gather, these English convents (w e have already m entioned
two others) were sim ply fragm ents o f England tem porarily
detached from the m otherland (to w hich they have now all been
restored). There is therefore no doubt at all that A rabella
cannot be the Borley victim . She was an English girl, educated
by English wom en, and it is inconceivable that she cou ld not
w rite her ow n language.
W e com e back, then, in the absence o f other ‘ claim ants,5 to
‘ M ary L airre’ ; and here I must point out the coincidence o f the
dates w hich connect her with Borley. I f she was done to death
in 1667 this happened just five years after the R ev. W illiam
Playne had rem oved to Langenhoo. The Rectory was still habitable,
and it was empty. It could be used, at any ratefo r a time, to house the
foreigner— and it could be ‘ arranged’ that it should remain empty when
she was ‘ gone' I do not for a m om ent suggest that this is in any
w ay conclusive. W e do not yet know (and w e m ay never know,
though H avre is now accessible again) w hether there was any
such person as M ary Lairre. But I subm it that the evidence,
so far accum ulated, is o f sufficient w eight to justify further
researches along this line. In particular, apart from the French
side, I w ould refer to the w edding-ring ‘ apports5 (w hich can o f
course find n o place in the A rabella-spy hypothesis). N othing
has happened so far which has shaken m y first im pression that
this is as significant as any o f the other dues w hich have been
so strikingly confirm ed. I do not believe that this tragedy was
b om in the m urky fog o f conspiracy, espionage, and intrigue. I
believe that it was the clim ax o f a m ore ordinary, m ore ‘ hum an5
story in w hich love and greed or am bition cam e into fatal con­
flict. This story cannot have been connected, as I originally
supposed, w ith the senior W aldegrave branch at C hew ton; it
must have had to do with som e unknown m em ber o f the
B orley W aldegraves, the descendant o f that N icholas w ho died
in 1621.
CHAPTER XVII
STRANGE OCCURRENCES IN A LONDON STUDIO
A S the historian o f the Borley hauntings, it is m y duty to
record every incident connected w ith the R ectory that is
brought to m y notice. N o m atter how ‘ im possible,’ ‘ unlikely,’
or even ‘ outrageous’ these incidents m ay appear, they must be
included in the Borley dossier— provided, o f course, that they
are vouched for by responsible persons whose veracity and good
faith cannot be questioned. T h e events that I am about to set
forth are so rem arkable that they deserve a chapter to them­
selves— if only a short one.
A m onth after m y return from B orley I took the fragm ent of
the skull, and other objects o f interest connected w ith Borley
R ectory, to the w ell-know n fine-art photographers, Messrs A . C.
C ooper, L td., photographers to the R oyal Fam ily, whose studios
were in the heart o f the W est End o f L ondon. Messrs Cooper
are fam ous for their photographic reproductions o f Royal
Academ y pictures, objets d’art, old china, and so on. I knew the
firm very slightly, and they had previously done a little work
for m e; I was introduced to them by the publishers o f one o f
m y books.
I called on Messrs C ooper, L td., on Septem ber 13, 1943.
Those o f m y readers w ho are superstitious w ill note the day of
the m onth. I saw the governing director o f the firm , M r A . C.
C ooper, and told him w hat I w anted. H e rem arked that he had
photographed som e queer, things in his tim e, but the ‘ exhibits’
I showed him were, he said, the strangest that had been brought
to him . O f course, I had to tell him the history o f them , and it
em erged from our conversation that he knew nothing whatever
about psychical research, and— though he was not rude enough
to tell m e so— probably cared less.
T h e first m ishap occurred when w e were exam ining the
portion o f skull that I was show ing him . Both he and I were
268
A N O T H E R S T O R Y OF A C L O C K 2 6 9
holding it, and it slipped out of our four hands. It fell on to
the wooden floor of the studio and broke into four almost equal
pieces. The skull certainly was brittle, but I was surprised that
it should have broken so easily. M r Cooper was very concerned,
and remarked that during his twenty-five years’ occupation of
the studios no accident had occurred to anything o f value
entrusted to him. However, by means ofgummed strips attached
to the concave surface of the skull, we managed to join it together
again, and made a fairly satisfactoryjob ofit. Some of the cracks
can be faintly seen in the photograph that I reproduce (Plate
X V III).
I left all the articles with him, asked him to do his best with
them, and said I would call for them on the following day. As
we were even then getting sporadic air raids over London, I did
not want to leave the things there too long.
I called on M r Cooper on the following morning, as arranged,
and he had a curious story to tell me. He greeted me with the
remark: ‘ Thank goodness you’ve come— the sooner your pro­
perty is off my premises the better!5 And then he told me what
had happened. When I left him on the previous day he pre­
pared to photograph the various objects. Then things began to
happen. First of all, a thousand-guinea oil-painting fell off its
easel on to the floor, when M r Cooper was in the studio, but
not near the easel. There was nothing to explain the fall.
Fortunately, no damage was done. He told me that such a
thing had never previously occurred during his whole business
career. Later in the afternoon another painting fell off an easel
when he was not near it, though he was in the studio. The
picture was undamaged. He remarked that the odds against
two paintings normally falling off their respective easels, for no
particular reason, on one afternoon, and in the same studio,
were astronomical. I agreed. Then— this same afternoon— he
spoilt two batches of films because he omitted to put the neces­
sary 'stop5in the lens of the camera— a thing he had never done
before.
But perhaps the most remarkable incident concerned a clock.
On his wall he had an old dark-room clock by means of which
2 ) 0 T H E E N D OF B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
he formerly timed the exposures of enlargements, etc. This clock
would not go. It had not gone for ten years, and no ‘ tinkering’
by M r Cooper would make it go. Suddenly— on this same
eventful afternoon— he heard the familiar loud tick that had not
fallen on his ears for a decade. He looked up— the clock was
going! It functioned for twenty minutes— and then stopped.
And nothing would make it go again. There were a few other
minor incidents, particulars of which I have forgotten. When
M r Cooper had finished his story I told him all about Poltergeists
and their mischievous ways. I left him very interested, and very
puzzled. I must emphasize that I do not claim any relation between
M r Cooper’s temporary possession of the Borley ‘ exhibits’ and
events of that exciting afternoon. I am merely relating facts.
When I was writing the title of this chapter I purposely used
the word ‘ occurrences’ and not ‘ phenomena.’ Though I and
others have had the Borley relics in our possession for varying
periods, nothing untoward has happened to any of us; or if so
I am not aware ofit. And the great Rectory yard-bell (Plate X X )
has swung in its cradle over my workshop at Pulborough for
many months, but I have yet to hear one paranormal ring.
Unfortunately, M r Cooper’s troubles were not over. Although
what happened later has, apparently, nothing to do with Borley,
I feel I must give some account of his misfortunes, especially as
I was slightly mixed up with them.
Five months after M r Cooper’s adventures in his studio I took
him (February 23, 1944) some very rare pamphlets to be photo­
graphed. I wanted the title-pages reproduced for the purpose
of illustrating my Poltergeist over England. The pamphlets were
about Poltergeists. I visited his studio in the morning and asked
him whether he could possibly do the work for me by the after­
noon, in order that I could take the books home with me the
same evening. I never left valuable material in London over­
night if I could avoid it, on account of the possibility of air raids.
And on this particular morning I had— with the late lamented
Hitler— an ‘ intuition’ : I somehow felt that it was specially
important that my pamphlets should not remain in town that
night.

I informed M r Cooper of my anxiety about the books, and
asked him to photograph the tide-pages while I waited. Being
very busy, he could not possibly do this, but said he would do
the work during the afternoon, and if I called at four o’clock the
books would be finished with, though I should have to wait until
the following morning for the prints. This was quite satisfactory,
and later in the day I called for my property.
Early morning of February 24 found me on my way to M r
Cooper’s studios. As I approached the district where his busi­
ness premises were— or rather had been— all I found was an area
of rubble. Not only had his studios disappeared, but I could not
even find the street where they had stood the day before. All had
disappeared in a severe air raid during the night. I thought of
my fortunate ‘ intuition,’ and was glad that I had acted upon it.
I am happy to record that no one was on the premises when Mr
Cooper’s studios were destroyed; and, having a duplicate set of
apparatus at home, he was soon in business again in other
premises. But his loss was serious. A day or two after the raid
I was astonished to receive all the prints of my title-pages. M r
Cooper had taken the precaution of collecting them on the night
of the raid, and took them home with him. Perhaps he too had
an ‘ intuition’ !
Having related the adventures of M r Cooper while the Borley
relics were in his possession, I will now tell how these same
objects affected Lieutenant Ian Aitchison, awell-known Canadian
psychometrist. For the uninformed reader, I will mention that
psychometry, or tactile clairvoyance, is a faculty said to be
possessed by persons capable of divining, by means of physical
contact, the properties, character, or associations of a thing with
which that thing has been connected. Personally, I believe in
psychometry, and I have proved that a very few persons do possess
the faculty— notably MileJeanne Laplace, who, when handling a
letter sent to me by the late Dr R . J. Tillyard, F .R .S., gave
(when he was alive) fifty-threecimpressions,’ forty of which were
correct or reasonably correct. One prediction (twice repeated)
was that Tillyard ‘ would die through a railroad or automobile
accident.’ The prediction was made in 1928 (andpublished at the
2 7 2 T H E E N D OF B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
time), and onJanuary 13, 1937, Tillyard was killed in a motor-car
smash near Canberra, Australia, where he lived.1
In July 1944 Lieutenant Aitchison was visiting my friend Mr
Sidney H . Glanville, mentioned so often in this report. Mr
Glanville rang me up one afternoon from his home at Fittleworth
to say that Aitchison was with him, and that they would like
to test the Lieutenant by letting him psychometrize the Borley
relics. So I sent them, and in due course I received their report
I have never met Lieutenant Aitchison.
The objects I sent to be dealt with included those ‘ apports’
alleged to have spontaneously ‘ appeared’ in Borley Rectory at
different times during its history, and the skull, etc., that were
dug up under the cellar floor. Lieutenant Aitchison had been
informed of the general history of the Borley hauntings, and had
probably read something of them in Canada, but had not been
given details concerning any particular object.
Lieutenant Aitchison appears to have a curious technique
when psychometrizing. With the object in his hand, he begins
his ‘ impressions’ in the third person, and then, without warning,
assumes the personality of the person alleged to have been previ­
ously connected with the object— or sometimes this process is
reversed. The relics were handed to him in the order described.
The first object handed to the Lieutenant was the French
Revolution medal found at the Rectory in 1929.2 His reaction
was: ‘ Old man bent, something wrong with his right leg.’ Then,
placing the medal in his left hand: ‘ He is looking out towards a
large building with castellated wall— no tower, and he is looking
at it from a distance. He has a small beard. I have a feeling it
is the last thing he ever saw.’
On the night of June 29-30, 1937, Group-Captain R . Carter
Jonas and Flight-Lieutenant Caunter spent a night at Borley
Rectory, and during one of their periodical rounds of the house,
discovered on a cupboard shelf an old nail-file which was not
there during an earlier inspection a short time previously.3 It
had ‘ appeared’ in the interval. This nail-file was handed to

3Ibid, pp. 231- 232.
T H E L I E U T E N A N T ’ S ^ I MP R E S S I O N S * 2 7 3
Aitchison, who said: "Taken from a person who was drowned,
A pond with very thick weeds round the edge and very isolated,
but I am at the bottom of that pond. I didn’t feel anything. I
was pushed in. In other words, I was murdered. The nail-file
has been taken from my body. I don’t like that one.’
When handed the patinated "Miraculous M edal’ all that
Lieutenant Aitchison said was: 6There seems to be a young girl
and I am wearing this medal. The only thing I can say is that
although I am very young, there is something tight round my
waist— very tight.’ I am afraid that the Lieutenant’s reactions do
not help us very much with our "Italian workman Mercur’
theory.
When the Lieutenant handled the child’s Roman Catholic
Confirmation medal found at Borley in 19291 he said, "I have
only a troubled, frightened feeling from it.’
The thin gold pendant really agitated the Lieutenant. The
first time he picked it up he dropped it immediately with the
remark, " / want to throw it awayl ' However, he finally held it in
his hand and said, " / want to get rid o f it! I feel very arrogantly
defiant of some one. They want me to do something, and I won't
do it! Whoever was wearing this had it round their neck— a girl
— when they were feeling arrogantly defiant. They tore it off
and threw it away. I see a small room, about nine feet by seven
feet; standing with back to window looking at a door about nine
feet away. Boards at side forming bed, and form on other side.
That is the position and scene as I feel arrogantly defiant.
There is a bit missed, and I am lying on those boards and some
one is on top of me when I feel this medal, and I pull it off and
throw it away. Very trying tim e! ’
When Lieutenant Aitchison touched thejaw-bone his reaction
was immediate and very definite:"Florence. Happiness! I have
a suggestion that I should start another place on my own, and I
say yes. I begin to be doubtful, I don’t know why. It wasn’t
strangulation, but she was right when she said strangulation: it
was rape. Waldegrave did it: he didn’t want her to start a new
nunnery on her own— he wanted her for his mistress. She had
1 Ibid., p. 59.
s
2 7 4 T H E END OF B 0 R L E Y r e c t o r y
taken a vow that she would never have any intercourse with
any m an: it was forced upon her, and she fought. She does not
know any more after the fight. As far as she knows she was
buried in the cellar or small room she was in. She took off the
medal because she had broken her vow: it was the medallion
she got when she first went to the convent. Feeling of shame.’
Given both jaw-bone and skull, Lieutenant Aitchison said:
cShe wants the rest of her remains found and buried properly,
not necessarily in churchyard— but out in the open away from
the Rectory. She knows nothing about anything else, or of the
ring [the wedding-ring; see below]. She thinks she is French
and seems to remember Queen Anne, but can’t recall things
clearly.’
The reader will remember that M r Geoffrey H . Motion and I
found, at midnight on M ay 9, 1938, a lady’s gold wedding-ring
in the Blue Room of Borley Rectory.1 Though we had searched
the room many times during that same day and evening, no
ring was visible until just before our departure for London.
The ring just Appeared.’ W ell, this same ring was handed to
Lieutenant Atchison, ‘ who dropped it at once, shouted
“ M urder!” and refused to touch it again.’
So much for the psychometric history of the Borley relics.
The reader now knows, from Lieutenant Atchison’s ‘ impres­
sions’ and reactions, that ‘ Mary Lairre’ (though he did not
mention her name, the implication is that he was referring to
the nun of the Planchette scripts) met her death through being
raped. She said, *Waldegrave did it.’ During the struggle she
managed to tear off the small gold plaque that was suspended
about her neck. The expression, ‘ Very trying time,’ is a curious
one.
The reference to Florence is also interesting. Assuming that
the Italian city— and not a woman— was indicated, it supports
our theory, as a ‘ clue’ or ‘ indicator,’ that an Italian workman
was responsible for disturbing the jaw-bone, lying in situ under
three feet of marl below the cellar floor. It is certain that
Lieutenant Atchison knew nothing about this theory. Another

' ‘ m a r i e ' s * b u r i a l 275
curious reference by the alleged ‘Marie Lairre5 was to her
remains. She would like them recovered and reburied, ‘not
necessarily in the [Borley] churchyard, but out in the open away
from the Rectory5 of unhappy memories. This suggests that
‘ Marie,5still a staunch Catholic, had some qualms about being
buried in an Anglican churchyard. As for the wedding-ring,
the psychometrist’s violent reaction, and his cry of ‘Murder 1
5
this is strong support for Canon Phythian-Adams's theory that
‘ Marie5
—if such a person ever existed—was brutally done to
death. A last comment: ‘ Marie5 ‘seems to remember Queen
Anne.5 This would be quite possible because Anne (1665-1714)
was two years old when ‘ Marie,5as she alleges, was murdered
in 1667, at the age of nineteen. The reference could not possibly
be to Anne of France (1460-1522), eldest daughter of Louis XI,
who, with her husband Pierre de Beaujeu, exercised a virtual
regency during the minority of her brother, Charles VIII
(1470-98), King ofFrance. Gharles’swifewas namedAnne, too.
Well, the reader must assess at his own valuation the testi­
mony of Lieutenant Ian Aiiehisoris psychometric impressions.
They are very interesting and thought-provoking, and add one
more puzzle to the already long list associated with Borley
Rectory.
CHAPTER XVIII
PLANCHETTE VINDICATED?
T O what extent were the clues and ‘ pointers’ provided for
us by the wall-writings, the Planchette scripts, the table­
tipping information, etc., confirmed by the discoveries at Borley
Rectory in August 1943— assuming there was any confirmation
whatsoever? W e will examine these clues in the order in which
they are set out in Chapter X III, bearing in mind that many
of them were not in the possession of the investigators until many
months after the Rectory excavations. I will put the positive
results in italics.
First there is the wall message, ‘ Well-tank-bottom-me.’ The
human remains were found at the bottom o f the well-tank, or where it
used to be; and the cream-jug was discovered at the bottom o f a well.
As to the ‘ pointing arrow’ in the kitchen passage, it was first
suggested by M r Taylor that it might be a sign or indicator
directing us to the well-tank and the remains. That is what it
actually proved to be. The arrow did point to the well-tank and the
human remains.
On October 24, 1937, the Glanvilles, A . J. Cuthbert, and M.
Kerr-Pearse held a table-tipping séance at Borley Rectory, at
which the alleged ‘ entities’ said that ‘ Marie Lairre’ was buried
‘ near the house,’ ‘ near the path,’ and that the ‘ grave was not
more than three feet deep.’ The human remains were found ‘ near
the house’ ‘ near the path’ (i.e., under the path or passage in the
cellar), and the grave was exactly threefeet deep.
On October 28, 1937, at Streatham, Mrs Helen Carter (née
Miss Helen Glanville), alone, received the following Planchette
instructions: she was told to look in the well, ‘ the well in the
cellar,’ and, asked whether ‘ it’ would be found in the well, the
‘ entity’ replied, ‘ Yes, the well that has been filled in.’ It was in
the round well in the cellar that the cream-jug was found; and in the
*
jMed-in’ well-tank were discovered the human remains. Actually,
both well and well-tank had been filled in.
276
P R E D I C T I O N S F U L F I L L E D 277
On October 30, 1937, at Borley, the Rev. A . C. Henning and
M r S. H . Glanville used the Planchette, and the ‘ entity’ ‘ Marie
Lairre,’ after declaring that she was ‘ murdered by Henry,’ said
her ‘ remains are near the wall.’ The fragments o f skull, etc. were
found very near the wall (footings orfoundations') o f the cellarpassage.
On October 31, 1937, at Streatham, with Miss Helen
Glanville and three other sitters using the Planchette, the ‘ entity’
signed herself' M ary,’ and said she was strangled by a Waldegrave,
and that her remains could be found at the ‘ end of a wall.’ The
remains werefound a t‘ the end o f a wall’— the wall o f the cellar passage.
(See plan of cellar.)
From now onward the Planchette clues recorded by the
Glanvilles and their friends in 1937 and 1938 were not in the
possession o f any o f the Rectory excavators, including myself, who dug
up the cellars on August 17 and 18, 1943. They had no know­
ledge of them until seventeen months after we had returned from
our investigation of the Borley cellars. So whatever confirmation
we can find in these clues is doubly interesting because we were
quite unaware that they even existed.
On November 5, 1937, the ‘ entity’ calling itself ‘Joseph
Glanvill’ wrote that if the operators would go to Borley ‘ The
truth will be found.’ Nearly six years later, at Borley, something was
found that may indicate the truth.
On November 20-21,1937, at Borley, the Rev. A. G. Henning
and M r S. H . Glanville were told by the communicating ‘ entity’
that a ‘ cup ’ was buried at the Rectory. This was later amplified
to a ‘ chalice.’ A cream-jug wasfound at Borley. A cup, chalice, or
cream-jug have points of resemblance in general outline, and
all are capable of containing liquid.
Later, at the same séance, ‘ Mary Lairre’ said a ‘ piece of
plate’ was buried. It was ‘ still buried,’ and should be dug up
‘ by a priest.’ The sitters were told to dig ‘ by a brick wall.’
A piece o fplate (the cream-jug) wasfound by a brick wall (the round
well was near a wall, or the brick wall of the well might have
been meant), and a priest (M r Henning) was present when it was
found. It was ‘ still buried.’
Then ‘ Mary Lairre’ said that her bones were buried near a
278 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
wall and added the word ‘ grave.5 The human bones were found
near a wall, in what was thought to have been a grave. A t this same
séance the ‘ entity5 ‘ Henry Waldegrave5 confessed that he killed
Mary ‘ with his hands, in the crypt,5 by which he must have
meant the cellars of the Rectory.
At the Planchette séance of December 5, 1937 (at Streatham),
‘ Marie Lairre5 communicated and said she would help the
sitters to find the ‘ cup.5 The ‘ cup5 (or cream-jug) wasfound.
On December 12, 1937, at Streatham, with Miss Glanville
and her brother as operators, the ‘ entity5‘ Harry Bull5suddenly
wrote ‘ Borley Rectory in the cellar there.5 The message was
repeated to him and confirmed as correct, and then he wrote:
‘ Yes. Is a cup buried under the floor one foot, down near the
well.5 The Planchette board was then placed over a map of
the cellar, and the pencil made a cross over the spot where the
round well was marked. The ‘ cup5 (i.e., cream-jug) was found
under thefloor-level ‘ down [near] the well,' in the round well as Plan­
chette exactly indicated on the map.
At Lancaster Gate, London, W .2, on December 14, 1937, Dr
H . F. Bellamy and his wife and M r S. H . Glanville and his son
Roger Glanville, held a Planchette séance. The ‘ entity,5calling
itself ‘Joseph Glanvill5 (the eminent English philosopher,
1636-80), communicated and was asked whether he could give
the sitters some information ‘ which we don’t know, but can
prove afterwards.5 The word ‘ Yes5 was written, and the sitters
were told definitely to Took under the brick floor in the cellar.5
Asked where in the cellar, the ‘ entity5wrote ‘ the well at Borley5
and said that ‘ writing5 would be found, mentioned the word
‘ missal,5 and added in single letters the word ‘ P-e-n.5 Investi­
gators did ‘ look under the brickfloor in the cellar at Borley,5 andfound
‘ writing5 (in the form o f lettering on the pendants) ; and the letters
‘ P-e-n* can be taken to be an abbreviation o f the word "pendants'
Most important clues were received by Miss Glanville and her
brother Roger at a Planchette séance held at Streatham on
December 19, 1937. ‘ Henry5 [Bull?] at once communicated
and wrote ‘ Look under the flooring will well help.5 This was
taken to mean that if they looked under the cellar floor ‘ Henry5
"p r o o f 5 279
would help to find something in the well. Asked what was under
the flooring, the "entity5 wrote "W riting5 and, emulating the
"Joseph Glanvill5entity, wrote "P-e-n5 in single letters, confirm­
ing the information received five days earlier. Then the ‘ entity5
continued: "The heap of bones will be found from the garden
and the pond. . . .5 "Henry5 was asked whether he meant that
the bones were removed from the pond and garden and reburied
under the cellar flooring, and he said "Yes.5 Then he made the
definite statement that the bones belonged to "Marie Lairre,5
and instructed the sitters to "Go to Borley and look under the
cellar floor for the cup and the missal and you will have proof.5
In the above remarkable message— which, I reiterate, was not
in the investigators5 possession until January 20, 1945 (i.e.,
seventeen months after the objects had been found)— is the defi­
nite statement {a) that writing would be found, and the word
"P -e-n5added; (,b) that it would be found under the cellar floor;
(c) that "bones5 had been removed from the pond and garden,
and reburied under the cellar floor; (i) that the bones belonged
to "M ary Lairre5; (e) that the "cup would be found under the
cellar floor5; and (f) that we should have "proof.5
M y comments are: (a) that writing (lettering) was found in the
shape o f the inscribedpendants ÇP-e-n’ ); (b) that they werefound under
the cellarfloor; (c) that bones werefound under the cellar floor; (e) that
the "cup5 (cream-jug) was found under ike cellarfloor, i.e., below the
level o f thefloor, in the round well; and ( /) that we obtained "proof’ o f
something* Certainly, no "missal5 was found, but that is not to
say that it is not there. As regards (d), we have no proof that the
bones belonged to "Marie Lairre,5 or that such a person ever
existed. But we have proof that they belonged to a young woman.
On January 8, 1938, at Streatham, Miss Glanville, her brother,
Squadron-Leader Roger H . Glanville, and Squadron-Leader
A . J. Cuthbert had a séance, and again "Henry5 promised he
would help. Then another "entity,5"Jeanne Waldegrave,5wrote :
"I mean you to find much proof.5
Finally, we have the remarkable Planchette messages from the
entity Sunex Amures,5 received by Miss Glanville and her
brother Roger on March 27, 1938, at their home in Streatham.

I was acquainted with this script and reproduced a portion of it
at p. 164 of The Most Haunted House in England. I published it
because of ‘ Sunex AmuresV threat to burn down the Rectory.
As the reader knows, the Rectory was afterwards burned down.
An equally significant statement in the message did not particu­
larly impress me at the time, but it does now because, in the
light of subsequent events, what cSunex Amures5 wrote was
striking in the extreme. He said: ‘ Under the ruins you will
find bone of murdered [indistinct] wardens [?]. Under the ruins
mean you to have proof of haunting of the Rectory at Borley
[indistinct] game tells the story of murder which happened there.5
M y comment: ‘ Under the ruins5 was found bone(s) of— and cunder
the ruins" wasfound proof o f a probable murder. So the whole of this
message from ‘ Sunex Amures,5 his promises and his threats,
have been implemented. That fact alone would justify us
answering in the affirmative the query with which I head this
chapter.
Whatever value we place on Blanchette ‘ messages,5 promises,
statements, and especially proper names and places, the vast
amount of information obtained by the Glanville family and
their friends by this means is, in the aggregate, impressive. Of
course, I have put the best interpretation I could on the various
statements in order to support the Borley ‘ story.5 Other inter­
pretations are possible, in some cases, and the reader may prefer
his own. But there they are, and no one can deny that the
messages are both interesting and remarkable. So we will leave
it at that.
CHAPTER XIX
THE END OF THE RECTORY: THE END OF THE ‘N U N ’ ?
W R IT IN G on June i, 1945, on m y return from a visit to
Borley and Liston, I have to report that the R ectory is
no m ore. N ot one brick stands upon another, and the site is as
clean as a swept floor. A ll the bricks in the cellar were rem oved,
together w ith the round w ell (w here the cream -jug was fou n d).
N othing unusual was discovered, but then no one was looking for
anything unusual. The cellar floor was rem oved, but the m arl
under it was not dug. T he cellars have now' been filled in.
I interview ed M iss W oods, the daughter o f the new ow ner,
w ho gave m e the latest inform ation concerning the end o f the
R ectory. T here are few ‘ relics5 o f the R ectory that have sur­
vived. As the reader knows, the great yard-bell hangs in m y
garden, but that is about all. I was curious to know w hat had
happened to the tw o ornate Italian inlaid m arble m antelpieces
that stood in the draw ing-and dining-room s. I was especially
interested in the fate o f the rather sinister-looking m onkish
m antelpiece that adorned the dining-room . I inquired, and
M iss W oods told m e a curious story about them . T he m antel­
pieces were carefully rem oved and put on one side. N ext day
they w ere found smashed to pieces and one o f the m onks’ head
was m issing. T he incident was ascribed to ‘ m ischievous boys.’
I w ill not suggest Poltergeists, but I think it is probable that
souvenir-hunters were the culprits. I am sorry about the ‘ m onk’s
h ead5m antelpiece (Plate IV , The M ost Haunted House in England)
as I had a sort o f curious affection for it. I am sorry it has gone.
M iss W oods told m e that m uch o f the m aterial from the
R ectory had been bought by farmers for the foundations o f their
hayricks and other purposes, and the rubble had been used for
m aking the runways o f some o f the m any A m erican airfields in
the district. M r Eric G . Calcraft, the photographer, o f Bulm er,
inform ed m e that he was building a garage from R ectory
281
2 8 2 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
materials, which included some eleven-inch oak beams. (The
Rectory was exceptionally well built.) M r Calcraft tells me
that he is now waiting to see whether ‘ anything happens’ when
the garage is completed.1
Although the Rectory has gone, the four rooms over the
stables (where M r and Mrs Edward Cooper had their exciting
nightly adventures; and in which M r and Mrs Gilbert Hayes
heard the strange but invisible footsteps described in Chapter V),
euphemistically termed ‘ the cottage,’ are happily still with us.
They now form a real cottage, with six rooms and a bay window,
this detached unit having been altered and added to. Perhaps
the resident ‘ entities’ will resent the alterations and become
active again. We shall see.
Towards the end of 1943 it was apparent that the Rectory—
or the ruins— was about to change hands once more. I knew
that Captain W . H . Gregson was trying to sell it; in fact, the
last time I saw him (August 18, 1943) he mentioned that, as he
contemplated going abroad, he would like to get rid of it. He
suggested my buying it. But the same difficulties that prevented
my acquiring the house in 1938 (when it was in perfect condition
and undamaged) operated when Captain Gregson offered the
place to me in 1943: I lived too far away from the Rectory and
could not look after it. I had a real affection for the place—
hideous though it was— because I had spent so many exciting
hours there; and the stories of its hauntings sustained my interest
for more than fifteen years. It is a pity that the Rectory, even
in its decay, was not preserved for posterity as a tangible
memorial to the work that has been done there by so many of
my investigating colleagues and myself, over so long a period.
In an article, ‘ Strange Tale of Borley,’ which was published in
Truth (September 27, 1940), the writer summed up how I felt—
and still feel— about it: ‘ The remains of Borley should surely
be taken over as a national monument— a tribute to a spirit of
1A curious story comes to me as this book goes to press. A man near Sudbury
recently ordered a brick garage to be erected on his property. The workmen made
a perfectly good job of it, and it was roofed in the usual way. The morning after
the men had completed their work the garage was found flat on the ground. It had
disintegrated in the night! U pon inquiry, I found that the bricks used were ‘second­
hand reds.’ Borley Rectory was built o f red bricks.

scientific inquiry which can brave the most eerie terrors of the
supernatural in order to arrive at a particle of truth.5 How I
agree! But, alas! the time is not yet when either the nation or
official science is sufficiently interested in psychical research to
provide money for such a purpose. But the day will come— as
surely as the sun will rise to-morrow morning. Well, I have lost
an old friend, though my long connexion with the Rectory
brought me many new ones.
When the two Oxford undergraduates, Harry Marshall and
J. H . Russell, visited Borley in January 1944 the Rectory was in
process of being demolished, which perhaps accounted for the
fact that the phenomena they recorded were not more impressive.
Three months later, on April 5, 1944, 1 visited Borley in order
to inspect the demolition work for myself. One reason why I
went was because I had been asked by Life, the famous American
pictorial magazine, to do an article, ‘ Haunted England.5 For
illustrating this article, the London editor required photographs
ofvarious alleged haunted houses, including Borley Rectory. So
on the date I have mentioned M r David E. Scherman, the Life
photographer (and an accredited war correspondent to the
United States Arm y); Miss Cynthia Ledsham, the researcher
and archivist attached to Time and Life, Ltd., publishers of
Life', and I, all journeyed by car to Borley in order to take the
pictures. Fortunately, it was a sunny day, and how successful
our trip was can be judged by M r Scherman’s magnificent
photographs reproduced in this volume.
W ell, I must say I had a shock— or more accurately, we had
a shock— when I saw the rapidly dwindling ruins: only the back
portion of the house (leading to the kitchen quarters) was stand­
ing. The cellars (they can be seen in the left foreground of the
photograph I reproduce, Plate X X II) were open to the sky where
they had not been filled in, and the wreckage of this large— if
ugly— Rectory was pathetic to behold. However, M r Scherman
photographed what was left of the ruins, because that is what
we were there for. But we were disappointed that demolition
work was so far advanced.
284 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
‘ T h e L a st P h e n o m e n o n ’ ?
One strange incident enlivened our visit, and puzzled us for
the rest of the day. It concerned the photograph of the ruins
taken by M r Scherman. He was using a miniature camera
of American make, and in order to embrace the whole of the
ruins he had to stand at least one hundred feet away from
them, as the lens he was using was not a very wide-angled
one. Miss Ledsham and I stood by his side, watching the pro­
ceedings.
As M r Scherman pressed the trigger which operated the
shutter mechanism of his camera lens a brick, or part of a brick,
suddenly shot up about four feet into the air in front of what
remained of the kitchen passage, just below the bathroom pas­
sage. The three of us saw it, and, as I said, we were at least a
hundred feet away from it. W e all laughed and called it ‘ the
last phenomenon,5and said the Poltergeists werecdemonstrating5
in honour of our visit. W e walked over to the passage, where
there were many bricks lying about. I picked up several, and
all appeared normal. No string or wire was attached to any of
them, and we saw no workmen at all on that side o f the Rectory.
As I say, the incident puzzled us, and I personally soon forgot
about it.
A few days later M r Scherman sent me the proofs of the photo­
graphs he had taken. They were in the form of small contact
prints from the original negatives, two and a quarter inches
square. The pictures were perfect, and I complimented Mr
Scherman upon his skill. Then, on the telephone, he asked me
if I had noticed anything about the photograph of the ruins. I
said no, and he then pointed out that against the dark back­
ground of the passage could be seen a tiny white pin-point. It
was the brick! Without knowing it at the time, M r Scherman
opened his shutter at the fraction of a second when the brick
was poised in mid-air. In proof of what a rapid exposure he
gave the picture, there is no sign of movement of the brick in
the photograph.
For the purpose of illustrating this book, M r Scherman kindly
sent me ten-inch-by-eight-inch enlargements of his photographs,
A P O L T E R G E I S T P H E N O M E N O N ? 285
and, of course, in the picture of the ruins (Plate X X II) can be
seen the whitish brick against the black background of the
kitchen passage. At my suggestion, M r Scherman sent me a
very much enlarged picture of the "flying brick5 (which I repro­
duce as Plate X X III) and the passage against which it was
photographed. The rectangular shape of the brick is plainly
visible. More important, it can be clearly seen that nothing is
attached to the brick. By the way, none of the pictures taken
by M r Scherman has been retouched in any way, and this applies
to every photograph in the book.
It is worth noting that the place where the brick suddenly shot
up was formerly part of the kitchen passage— focus of many
phenomena, and on the walls of which appeared at least two
"messages.5 One of them was cMarianne-Light-Mass-Prayers.5
And in the kitchen passage (see Plan II) was the door leading to
the sewing-room, in which many manifestations occurred both
before and after the fire. It is interesting that the brick should
have been levitated at this precise spot. If, indeed, this was a
genuine paranormal phenomenon, then we have the first photo­
graph ever taken of a Poltergeist projectile in flight.
O t h e r St r a n g e I n c id e n ts
The levitation of the half-brick was not the only strange inci­
dent connected with the demolition of Borley Rectory. In the
Suffolk Free Press for M ay 24, 1944 (i.e., seven weeks after our
visit), is the following editorial paragraph. It is headed 6Queer.5
I understand that the fire-ruined Borley Rectory, which was
reputed to be the most haunted house in England, is being (or has
been) demolished and the bricks carted away for rubble. The
grounds, too, in which the ghost of the nun is said to have walked,
are being cleared. I heard an interesting story the other day which
supports the idea that there is always something queer about the
place. A local firm was engaged in felling some trees, and Every­
thing seemed to go wrong.5 Three axes broke in the course of the
work; one man received a shoulder injury; and two trees which
were roped and cut so as to fall into the grounds, fell into the road
instead, the ropes breaking, and a tractor had to be fetched to haul
the timber off the road.
286 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
It is interesting to note how the value of the Rectory and/or
its ruins fluctuated. In 1938 the house, in perfect condition,
with, I think, about three acres of ground, was offered to me for
£500, freehold, together with the ‘ cottage.5 It was then insured
for £3500. Then it was purchased by Captain Gregson, and I
imagine that he too bought it at the price I have mentioned.
Then came the fire— and the war, when prices of everything
soared and materials (especially timber) became almost un­
obtainable except under priority permit.
On September 14, 1943, Captain Gregson wrote to me to ask
if I knew of any psychic enthusiasts, with means, who would buy
the ruins for their sentimental interest and as a memorial to
scientific psychical research—-thus echoing the pious hope,
expressed by Truth, which I mentioned a page or so back. I
agreed with him that the Rectory should not be lost to posterity,
but I knew of no one who was ‘ enthusiastic5 enough to pay the
£ 1ipo that the Captain was then asking for the ruins. He
thought that perhaps some rich American would buy it. This
might have been possible before the war.
The next news I heard about the Rectory was that it had been
sold to a local man. The price mentioned by my informant was
£560. If, in fact, this sum is correct then the man got a bargain.
In addition to the four-roomed ‘ cottage5 over the stables, and
the large yard and grounds, the building material extracted
from the ruins must alone have been worth the money, owing
to scarcity.
W ill another building ever be erected on the site where the
Rectory once stood? O f course, I cannot say, but I think it is
very doubtful. With the parish of Borley combined with its near
neighbour, Liston, there is now no need for a priest’s house in
the former village. Liston Rectory (Plate X X V ) is only a mile
or so away, and Borley-cum-Liston can be— and is— satisfac­
torily cared for by one incumbent. And apart from all other
considerations, Queen Anne’s Bounty will never, I am certain,
build a new rectory on or near the site of the old one. If they
do it will not be one containing thirty-five rooms! The ecclesi­
astical authorities, having got rid of one ‘ troublesome5 house,

are not likely to tempt the Poltergeists by erecting another near
the old site. A private person might choose the chaunted 3 site
for his residence, but even that is unlikely. Land is cheap and
plentiful in the Borley district, and anyone desiring to build in
the neighbourhood would have little trouble in finding a suitable
plot without a.€history.3 Unless, of course, he happened to be a
psychical researcher! (But see postscript at p. 293).
P h e n o m e n a b e c o m in g W e a k e r
But even the grounds of Borley Rectory may remain cactive.3
On the twenty-fifth— and last— visit to Borley by the Cambridge
Commission on July 22, 1944, the Rectory was even then non­
existent, and the investigators were driven to take shelter in the
old summer-house in order to have a roof over their heads. As
we have seen in Chapter IX , phenomena were not wanting.
True, they were only raps; but a paranormal rap is, in its way,
as interesting as, and perhaps even more valuable than, a para­
normal cfigure.3 And did not M r and Mrs Gilbert Hayes have
some exciting hours (see Chapter V ) in the grounds? So who shall
say that the extinction of the Rectory means the end of the
phenomena? Personally, I should hesitate to make such an
assertion. Though the£nun3has been laid to rest, the Poltergeists
(in all probability) still remain.1
It is undeniably true, however, that during the past year or
so (I am writing this in June 1945) phenomena have become
weaker and less frequent. If the ‘ nun3 was responsible for the
manifestations, then the fact of the Masses said for her repose,
and that her alleged remains have been given Christian bunal,
may have brought consolation and relief to the spirit which we
1Perhaps as some proofo f this Dr W . G. Shakespeare, ofW est M alvern, W orcester­
shire, sends me the following account o f an interesting experience. In a letter dated
September 20, 1945, he says: £I thought you might be interested to hear the result of
my visit to Borley last week-end, when my son (aged 15) and I camped out by the
site of the ruins. W e saw nothing out o f the ordinary, but on the M onday morning
at about 3A
.M
. I was awakened by hearing a distinct tap, tap, tap, tap, tap--n o t very
quick in succession but evenly spaced. I could not tell from what direction it was
com ing, and was just getting out o f my sleeping-bag to investigate when it stopped.
I did not wake my boy as I thought he was asleep. Later on, when it was light,
he told me that he too had beard the tapping but had not wakened me as he thought
I was asleep. You will think that we did not show much enthusiasm^as regards
watch-keeping, but we had waited up till the early hours on two successive nights!1
288 T H E E N D O F B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
call eMarie Lairre.5 Several of these Masses have been said in
various parts of the country. I have details of only two: one at
Oxford and another (the first, I believe) at the beautiful Roman
Catholic Church of S. Philip Neri, Arundel, Sussex. On
October 29, 1943, the Rev. Father John Wright, of S. Philipp,
wrote to say that" Mass is being said here to-morrow morning for
the repose of the soul of the good lady5
— the "Borley Nun.5 It
was a Requiem Mass, as was so often desired by the "entity5com­
municating through Planchette scripts and the poignant cwall
messages.5
T h e L a st R ite s
In a further attempt to carry o u t 6Marie LairreV wishes and
prayers, and further to console and comfort her spirit, I decided
to re-inter the human remains found under the cellar floor,
together with most of the alleged apports and other objects con­
nected with the Borley case. I argued that even if the bones had
no connexion at all with the "nun5the proper place for them was
in consecrated ground— no matter to whom they once belonged.
As for the " Miraculous M edal,5the pendants, etc., if there is any
conceivable link between them and "M arie,5 then, I thought,
they should be buried with the skull and jaw-bone. I asked the
Rev. A . C. Henning to give the remains of the alleged eMarie
Lairre5 Christian burial, thus fulfilling her wishes, so often
expressed. He kindly consented to do this.
On Tuesday, May 29, 1945, I journeyed to Borley, where I
was again the guest of M r -Henning, at Liston Rectory (see
Plate X X V ) . I took with me the fragments of skull and jaw­
bone, with the pendants, etc. All were contained in a well-made
and dovetailed cedarwood casket, measuring five inches by four.
What I did not put in the casket were (a) the cream-jug found in
the round well; (¿) the gold wedding-ring picked up in the Blue
Room ; and (c) the nail-file that "appeared5 during an observa­
tional period of some of my colleagues. I could not visualize any
conceivable direct connexion between the cream-jug and/or the
ring with the "nun.5 Admittedly, they were "pointers5 (as I have
suggested elsewhere), but, I think, that is all. Also, as the ring
T H E {N U N 5 L A I D T O R E S T 289
and jug are of some intrinsic value, their burial might have
tempted some unscrupulous person to disinter the casket.
In the casket was placed a brass tablet on which was engraved
the date on which the human remains were found, and the
place; and the date on which they were reinterred. Before
nailing on the lid of the casket Mr Henning placed his visiting-
card with the objects. I chose cedar for the casket, as the wood
is immune from the attacks of insects and other corroders.
It was decided to re-inter the remains in Liston Churchyard.
This was more convenient for all concerned, and there were
other reasons which prompted us to bury them there, rather
than at Borley, one and a half miles away. The cnun’ did not
specify Borley, or even consecrated ground. In fact, she did not
even stipulate a Roman Catholic burial-place: merely Christian
burial.
So early in the evening of May 29, 1945, all that remained of
the supposed ‘ nun5 was laid to rest. At any rate, the remains
belonged to a young woman— of that we are quite certain.1 It
was a glorious evening, mild, windless, and with the sun pouring
down on us. The sexton had dug the hole earlier in the day.
There were present the Rector of Borley-cum-Liston and Mrs
Henning (with their young son, Stephen); Mr Eric G. Calcraft,
who, for the purpose of our records, took photographs of the
proceedings (Plate X X I V ) ; the sexton; and myself. A few
puzzled village children (there are only fifteen houses at Liston)
could be seen peering through the hedge on the far side of the
churchyard.
It was a simple and impressive little ceremony. In his
appropriate robes, the Rector recited the following prayer,
cCommemoration of the Faithful Departed/ from The Missal:2
Almighty God, with whom do live the spirits ofjust men made
perfect, after they are delivered from their earthly prisons: we
humbly commend the soul of Thy servant into Thy hands, as into
the hands of a faithful Creator and most merciful Saviour; that
whatsoever defilements she may have contracted in this miserable
and naughty world being purged and done away, she may be

T
2gO THE END OF BORLEY RECTORY
presented pure and without spot before Thee; through the precious
blood and merits of Thy Son, our Saviour, Jesus Christ. Amen.
Then came another prayer from The Missal, expanded from
Gelasian Sacramentary and Queen Elizabeth's Primer (1559):
Almighty, everlasting God, to whom no prayer is ever made
without hope of Thy mercy: be gracious to the soul of Thy servant
now departed this life, that, being loosed from the bonds of sin
and death, she may, with all Thy people, be satisfied from Thine
eternal joys; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
Then came the Committal, the service concluding with the
Grace. The sexton then filled in the hole and replaced the turf.
The casket was lowered into the grave at 5.42 p.m. B.D.S.T.
I noted the exact minute for the following reasons: {a) In case
some one connected with the Borley hauntings recorded a
phenomenon as having occurred at that precise moment; (b) in
case we should get a repetition of what happened when another
skull, connected with a Poltergeist infestation, was interred in
a churchyard. I have already referred to this case in Chapter I,
a case that has some correspondences with the Borley hauntings.
Briefly, there were some skulls at Timberbottom Farm,
Bradshaw, near Bolton, possessed for generations by the
Hardcastle family of Bradshaw Hall, Bolton, Lancashire.
Periodically there were Poltergeist disturbances at the farm­
house, and the grandfather of Colonel Henry M . Hardcastle
(who sent me the account) decided to give the skulls Christian
burial. There were two skulls: a normal-sized male specimen,
and a much smaller- one belonging to a woman. The skulls were
duly buried, and immediately the most violent disturbances were
witnessed at the farm. These persisted, so the skulls were dug
up again and set up on the family Bible— where they remain to
this day. The manifestations at once ceased, at least for a long
time. Then an accident occurred to the small skull, and again
there was pandemonium at the farm.1 For full details of this
■ w
as 1 have acquired a copy of the excessively rare p
rivately
printedhistopr (TheBell Witch [Nashville, Tenn.], 1934) ofthefamous ‘Bellw
itch.’

most interesting story, the reader should consult my Search fo r
Truth (pp. 224-225)* That, then, is why I took particular notice
of the exact minute we interred the fragments. Up to the time
of writing I have heard of no incident that could be linked up
with the Liston burial.
I have said that cMarie Lairre’ did not stipulate a Roman
Catholic burial or burial-place. Actually, however, there was
a slight connexion between the Liston service and the Catholic
faith, to the extent that the second prayer I have quoted is
attributed to Pope Gelasius I (492-496) and is from his Liber
Sacramentorum, parts of which, at least, he certainly composed.
Those readers who are interested in the question should consult
H . A . Wilson’s Gelasian Sacramentary (Oxford, 1894).
The Missal: Another ' Pointer5?
When I opened the book from which the Rev. A . CL Henning
extracted the prayers he recited at the Liston burial, and found
that its title was The Missal, I immediately thought of the
references to a 'missal’ in the Planchette scripts. (See Chapter
X III.) Certainly we found no missal. But the term 'm issal5
can be interpreted in at least two ways. What we were hoping
to find under the cellar floor was an illuminated black-letter or
manuscript book of early date. Another meaning of the word
relates to the service of the Mass or Mass-book. And here we
were using a missal in the latter sense at the nun’s burial. Is it
possible that the word 'missal5in the Planchette scripts referred
to the Mass-book, which' Marie Lairre’ desired to be used when
firstappeared in 1817, but has returnedintermittently from time to time. In 1934
Charles Bailey Bell, M.D., the present head of the family, compiled a complete
account of the infestation from the family records and first-hand evidence from
surviving w
itnesses. The report w
as issued to his relatives, etc. I m
ention it here
because part of the story (pp. 99-101) concerns a jaw-bone which w

The ‘Bell witch* case, which has many correspondences with Borley, is a truly
amazing one, and fully documented.
292 THE END OF BORLEY RECTORY
her remains were found and given Christian burial? If so, then
it is extraordinary that such a book should have been used,
because M r Henning did not know of the Planchette references,
and I did not know that he was going to use such a book. I
regard it as another ‘ pointer’ or ‘ indicator,’ of which we have
had so many in this case.
Death of the Rev. L. A. Foyster
When I was at Liston during my last visit in June 1945, I
learned with regret that the Rev. Lionel Algernon Foyster, who
was Rector of Borley from 1930 to 1935, had passed away. He
died at Rendlesham, four miles from Woodbridge, Suffolk, on
April 18, 1945. Mrs Henning, who told me of his death, re­
marked that it was a melancholy coincidence that he should
have died on the very day on which she gave a talk on the Borley
hauntings to the Cambridge Women’s Luncheon Club (see
Chapter IV ). Present at the luncheon was M r Foyster’s cousin,
who confirmed that all the things of which Mrs Henning spoke
had actually taken place.
Psychical researchers— myself especially— are much indebted
to M r and Mrs Foyster for so faithfully recording the Borley
phenomena. It will be remembered that M r Foyster kept a
day-to-day diary (some extracts from which are reproduced in
this volume) of the manifestations. And it was during Mr
Foyster’s incumbency that so many strange things happened at
the.Rectory, especially during the first fifteen months of his
residence there. This .was the period of the pathetic wall-
writings; the most violent Poltergeist phenomena; and the
appearance, disappearance, and reappearance of many curious
objects— some of which had never been seen before. It was
during this period, too, that Dom Richard Whitehouse, O.S.B.,
witnessed the amazing display of the bottle-smashing ‘ entities,’
etc.
Now that ‘ Marie Lairre’ has received Christian burial, will
the ‘ mm ’ phenomena completely cease? Is her unquiet spirit
now at rest? I believe that both queries can be answered in the

complied with all her requests: the finding of her supposed

There is one thing more we can do for her (and I am sure my

P.S. Too late to be included in the body of this chapter is the
following information concerning the future of the Rectory
garden site. It is extracted from the Evening News> March 14,
1946, and is part of a report of an interview with Mr and Mrs
Tom Gooch:
Mr Gooch is a farmer; his wife is a school-mistress in a girls5
church school in the next village [to Borley]. Between them they
have just paid £300 for part of the land on which the haunted
Rectory stood before it was burnt down (mysteriously, of course—
nothing happens normally at Borley) in 1939. On the five acres of
orchard and garden, across which the ghostly figure of a nun is said
to walk, the Gooch’s, a matter-of-fact couple, intend to build their
home. . . . Questioned closely, Mrs Gooch admitted to having
heard ‘ noises3 and witnessed some rather odd goings-on in the
days of the old Rectory. She has never seen the headless coach­
man, but once, when she was attending a church council meeting
in the Rectory, a picture fell off the wall and bits of brick and twig
came hurtling down the chimney.
Assuming that the above information is correct, the Nun’s
Walk will be built over, and the famous summer-house (Plate IV )
is likely to disappear. People are speculating as to what— if any
— manifestations will occur in M r Gooch’s new home.

CHAPTER XX
BORLEY AND BALLECHIN
I CANNOT close this volume without drawing attention to
another famous Poltergeist haunting— that of Ballechin
House, Strathtay, Perthshire. The reason I do so is because
of the amazing correspondences or parallelisms that exist be­
tween the two cases. In any history of Borley Rectory these
resemblances should be pointed out. Some day, when we know
more about these things, the similarity between manifestations
occurring at the same time, but hundreds of miles apart, may
perhaps help us. But in order to make these similarities intelli­
gible to the reader I must give a short history of the Ballechin
hauntings, an account of which first appeared in The Times. It
started a long and acrimonious correspondence about what
really happened at a ‘ haunted house-party.’
Ballechin was owned by a Captain J. M . S. Steuart. It is a
fairly modern house, but is built on the site of a much older
residence. It was after the place had been systematically investi­
gated by a group of psychical researchers in the spring of 1897
that The Times controversy began. Under the title of ‘ On the
Trail of a Ghost,’ The Times published (June 8 to 24, 1897) a
series of letters from certain sceptics who had not been present
during the investigation; and printed the personal narratives of
others who had experienced the phenomena, and who had been
thoroughly convinced of their paranormality.
The story of how Ballechin House came to be investigated is
interesting. In 1892 John, third Marquess of Bute (who was
deeply interested in such things and was a well-known psychical
researcher), happened to meet a Jesuit priest, Father Hayden,
S J , who had been staying at Ballechin. The house was com­
pletely furnished, though the Steuarts were not in residence.
Father Hayden had an extraordinary experience, which he
related to Lord Bute. His story is as follows:
294
f a t h e r h a y b e n ' s s t o r y 295
I went to Ballechin on Thursday, July 14, 1892, and I left it on
Saturday, July 23. So I slept at Ballechin for nine nights, or rather
one night, because I was disturbed by very queer and extraordinary
noises every night except the last, which I spent in Mr Steuart’s
dressing-room. At first I occupied the room to the extreme right
of the landing; then my things were removed to another room. In
both these rooms I heard loud and inexplicable noises every night,
but on two or three nights, in addition to these, another noise
affrighted me— a sound of somebody or something falling against
the door outside. It seemed, at the time, as ifa calfor big dog would
make such a noise. Why those particular animals came into my
head I cannot tell. But in attempting to describe these indescribable
phenomena I notice now I always do say it was like a calf or a big
dog falling against the door. Why did I not hear the noises on the
ninth night? Were there none where I was? These are questions
the answers to which are not apparent. It may be there were
noises, but I slept too soundly to hear them. One of the oddest
things in my case, in connexion with the house, is that it appeared
to me (¿2) that somebody was relieved by my departure; (6) that
nothing could induce me to pass another night there, at all events
alone, though in other respects I do not think I am a coward.
Father Hayden, in his narrative, mentions that he also heard
screams and raps; and, more alarming, there occurred between
his bed and the ceiling Toud noises like continuous explosions
of petards.5 He tried room after room in the house, but the
disturbances^ followed him. He sprinkled the rooms with holy
water and recited the Visita qu&sumus— a prayer for the divine
protection of a house and its occupants— but all to no purpose.
A Roman Catholic archbishop also attempted to exorcize the
house— or, rather, the ghosts— but failed to stop the disturbances.
In August 1893 Father Hayden met by accident a young
woman who, in 1881, had been governess in the Steuart family.
Without his mentioning a word that he had ever even been to
Ballechin, she volunteered the statement that she had left her
employment because so many people complained of queer noises
in the house. She became frightened and left. When questioned,
it transpired that the noises had occurred in the identical bed­
rooms occupied by Father Hayden.
In August 1896 Ballechin House was let to a wealthy Spanish
family, who had many servants, including an English butler,
2 9 6 t h e e n d o f b o r l e y r e c t o r y
Mr Harold Sanders. They agreed to rent it for twelve months.
They gave a house-party, and their guests went through some
curious experiences. A ‘ Miss B.’ wrote to The Times:
I wakened suddenly in the middle of the night and noticed how
quiet the house was. Then I heard the clock strike two, and a few
minutes later there came a crashing, vibrating battering against
the door of the outer room. My sister was sleeping very soundly,
but she started up in a moment at the noise, wide awake.
Two nights later Miss B. and her sister again heard the ‘ batter­
ing5 noise, when they and their host’s daughter remained in the
latter’s bedroom, hoping to hear the Poltergeist. There were
also two military men among the guests, and they too had some
startling experiences. Major B. records (August 24, 1896) that
at about 3.30 a .m. I heard very loud knocking, apparently on
Colonel A .’s door, about nine raps in all— three raps quickly one
after the other, then three more the same, and three more the same.
It was as if some one was hitting the door with his fist as hard as he
could hit. I left my room at once, but could find nothing to account
for the noise. It was broad daylight at the time. I heard the same
noises on August 28 and 30 at about the same hour.
Colonel A. confirmed the Major’s account and remarked that ‘I
heard a terrific banging at my bedroom door, generally about
from 2 to 3 a .m., two nights out o f three.’
Another member of the house-party, a Mrs G ., said:
I, my daughter, and my husband were put in rooms adjoining,
at the end of the new wing. At 2 a .m. a succession of thundering
knocks came from the end of our passage, re-echoing through the
house, where it was heard by many others. About half an hour
afterwards my husband heard a piercing shriek; then all was still.
The next night, and succeeding ones, we heard loud single knocks
at different doors along our passage. The last night but one before
we left I was roused from sleep by hearing the clock strike one, and
immediately it had ceased six violent blows shook our own door
on its hinges, and came with frightful rapidity, followed by deep
groans.
The best account of this ‘ haunted house-party’ comes from
the butler, already mentioned. In a letter to The Times (June 21,
1897), he speaks of many kinds of noises, such as rattling, knock-
ADVENTURES OF A BUTLER *97
m g , ctremendous thumping on the doors/ heavy footsteps along
the passages, and similar disturbances heard by every inmate of
the house, including the servants. M r Sanders continues:
The same thing happened with variations almost nightly for the
succeeding two months that I was there, and every visitor that
came to the house was disturbed in the same manner. One gende-
man (a colonel) told me he was awakened on several occasions
'with the feeling that some one was pulling the bedclothes off him;
sometimes heavy footsteps were heard, at others like the rustling of
a lady’s dress; and sometimes groans were heard, but nearly
always accompanied with heavy knocking; sometimes the whole
house would be aroused. One night I remember five gendemen
meeting at the top of the stairs in their night-suits, some with sticks
or pokers— one had a revolver— vowing vengeance on the dis­
turbers of their sleep. During the two months after I first heard
the noises I kept watch altogether about twelve times in various
parts of the house, mosdy unknown to others (at the time), and
have heard the noises in the wing as well as other parts.
When watching I always experienced a peculiar sensation a few
minutes before hearing any noise. I can only describe it as like
suddenly entering an ice-house, and a feeling that some one was
present and about to speak to me. On three different nights I was
awakened by my bedclothes being pulled off my feet. But the
w
r
orst night I had at Ballechin was one night about the second week
in September, and I shall never forget it as long as I live. I had
been keeping watch with two gendemen: one a visitor, the other
one of the house. We heard the noises I have described about half­
past two. Both gendemen were very much alarmed, but we
searched everywhere, but could not find any trace of the ghost or
cause of the noises, although they came this time from an un­
occupied room. (I may mention that the noises were never heard
in the daytime, but always between twelve, midnight, and four in
the m o rn in g— generally between two and four o’clock.) After a
thorough search the two gendemen went to bed sadder, but not
wiser, men, for we had discovered nothing. I then went to my
room, but not to bed, for I was not satisfied, and decided to con­
tinue the watch alone. So I seated myself on the service stairs. . . .
I had not long to wait (about twenty minutes) when the knocking
recommenced from the same direction as before, but much louder
than before, followed, after a very short interval, by two distinct
groans, which certainly made me feel very uncomfortable, for it
sounded like some one being stabbed and then falling to the floor.
298 THE END OF BORLEY RECTORY
That was enough for me. I went and asked the two gentlemen who
had just gone to bed if they had heard anything. One said he had
heard five knocks and two groans, the same as I had; while the
other (whose room was much nearer to where the sounds came
from) said he had heard nothing. I then retired to my bed, but
not to sleep, for I had not been in bed three minutes before I
experienced the sensation as before, but instead of being followed
by knocking, my bedclothes were lifted up and let fall again—first
at the foot of my bed, but gradually coming towards my head. I
held the clothes around my neck with my hands, but they were
gently lifted in spite of my efforts to hold them. I then reached
around me with my hand, but could feel nothing. This was im­
mediately followed by my being fanned as though some bird w
as
flying around my head, and I could distinctly hear and feel some­
thing breathing on me. I then tried to reach some matches that
were on a chair by my bedside, but my hand was held back as if
by some invisible power. Then the thing seemed to retire to the
foot of my bed. Then I suddenly found the foot of my bed lifted
up and carried around towards the window for about three or four
feet, then replaced to its former position. All this did not take, I
should think, more than two or three minutes, although at the
time it seemed hours to me. Just then the clock struck four and,
being tired out with my long night’s watching, I fell asleep.
I remarked that the Spanish family rented Ballechin for twelve
months. They stayed exactly eleven weeks. They forfeited nine
months’ rent rather than spend a winter in the house.
Lord Bute was so impressed with the evidence (which I have
now placed before the reader) that he decided to rent Ballechin
House, and asked Colonel Lemesurier Taylor and Miss A.
Goodrich-Freer (both experienced researchers) to make a
thorough investigation. With a staff of servants, they began
their inquiry on February 3, 1897. Lord Bute and Miss
. Goodrich-Freer published their report in 1899 under the title
of The Alleged Hunting o f B------ House, and it is from this
book that we learn what happened during their search for
the truth.
On the morning after their arrival Miss Freer was cstartled
by a loud clanging sound, which seemed to resound through the
house.’ It was as if a long metal bar was being struck with a
wooden mallet. The clanging was repeated at frequent intervals
A WEEPING NUN 299
during trwo hours. Then ‘ voices,’ footsteps, and the sounds of
things being dragged about were heard. Another phenomenon,
which persisted throughout the investigation, was an aural
impression as of some one reading aloud. No words could be
distinguished, but the tone and the cadence always reminded
them of a priest ‘ saying his office.’
Miss Freer and her friends saw the phantasm of a nun gliding
up a glen, when the snow lay thick on the ground. The figure
stopped, looked at Miss Freer, and then slowly mounted a slope
apparently too steep for a human to climb. Then she dis­
appeared. This nun was seen on many occasions, and once
Miss Freer saw her in tears. She says: ‘ Her weeping seemed to
me passionate and unrestrained,’ and added that ‘ she speaks
upon a rather high note with a quality of youth in her voice.’
By means of a Ouija board, they ascertained that the nun’s
name was ‘ Ishbel,’ but not much reliance can be placed on this
method of obtaining ‘ information.’
From the diary that Miss Freer kept, and in which she re­
corded every incident, it is clear that the major phenomena at
Ballechin House were of typical Poltergeist origin. W e read of
many footsteps, voices, dragging of heavy objects, pattering
sounds, explosive bangs, reading in monotone, knodrings,
crashes, ‘ movements of animals,’ groans, falls of heavy objects,
rappings, metallic sounds, thumps on doors, footsteps in locked
and empty rooms, shuffling sounds, and so on.
A number of distinguished persons visited Ballechin during
the investigation, and among them were F. ,W . H . Myers and
Sir (then M r) Oliver Lodge. Sir Oliver said that he had heard
knocks on the wall, a sawing noise, and a droning and a wailing
sound. He also heard raps, some ofwhich, he remarked, ‘ seemed
intelligent.’
Miss Freer and her party remained at Ballechin House for
about three months, and the result of their investigation was that
they were convinced that the phenomena were paranormal. I
agree.
The inquiry was carefully planned and carried out, and
though scientific psychical research was then only in its infancy,
300 THE END OF BORLEY RECTORY
the investigators did the best they could in the circumstances.
A few weeks after Lord Bute relinquished his tenancy The Times
controversy started. I need not add anything to what I have
already said about this correspondence, except that nothing
emerged which caused Lord Bute and his friends to modify their
opinion that Ballechin House was, in fact, haunted. I say ‘ was’
because, as in so many Poltergeist cases, the phenomena abruptly
ceased. I have heard of no further disturbances there.
I will now place in parallel columns the truly remarkable
correspondences between the haunted Rectory and the haunted
manor house:

Though there are so many correspondences (and I have not
named them all) between Borley and Ballechin hauntings, the
cases are not comparable from the evidential standpoint. Some
two hundred people have testified to paranormal' happenings at
the Rectory, but only a relatively small number of observers
witnessed the Scottish phenomena. Borley was investigated for
sixteen years—Ballechin for three months. And whereas the
Ballechin manifestations persisted— or actively persisted—for
only a few years, ánd then stopped suddenly, our evidence proves
that Borley has been infested for nearly a century, and the
phenomena may not even now have entirely ceased. But they
are becoming weaker and much less frequent. The Ballechin
mystery was never solved.
CHAPTER XXI
‘ MIRACLES’ AND THEIR MECHANICS
SSUMING that the phenomena—or even a tenth o f them
— recorded in this volume and in my previous monograph
on Borley are genuine, how are we to account for them? How
and why do they happen? Can their causation be explained?
I will say at once that we know absolutely nothing about the
mechanism that causes a ghost to appear or disappear; or why
a Poltergeist heaves half a brick at an observer; or what a
Poltergeist is, or where it gets its energy from to throw the
brick.1 We do not know what happens to us when we die, or
where we go to, or how we get there. And if we can ‘ come
back5
—in the spiritualistic sense—we do not know how that
occurs, either! I reiterate that we know nothing about these
things, which must have puzzled mankind since the beginning
of Time.
O f course, there are theories, and the most brilliant intellects
have, for hundreds of years, been trying to solve the problems.
They have not succeeded. Some of these theories are as brilliant
as the brains that evolved them—but they remain theories. This
is not the place to discuss them, and I must refer the reader to
the philosophers and spiritualists, or their works, for the many
conjectures and speculations concerning immortality, the after­
life, and the eternal question, ‘ Where do we go from here?’
There are hundreds of books on the subject—and most o f them
contradict one another! In other words, the authors are merely
guessing. I wish I had a good theory to present to the reader—a
theory that would cover all the known facts o f the Borley case,
but I have not. Anyway, it’s not myjob. But I am quite certain
that, some day, Science willdiscover the Great Secret, and during
recent years considerable progress has been made in interesting
orthodoxy, if nbt in the elucidation of the problems that confront
it. I shall refer to this progress in the next chapter.
1 These questions are more fully discussed in my Poltergeist over England.
303
3 O4 T H E E N D OF B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
If we have learned little from the living as regards the next
world, we have learned less from those alleged discarnatecentities’
who say they have returned from the ‘ Summer Land.9 They
tell us all about their life there, how they arrived, how they
came back, and how happy they are— though some appear to
be supremely unhappy. If these séance-room entities were con­
sistent in what they tell us we might believe them. But they are
not. Each tells a different story.
Yet ‘ survival9is, to me, an attractive concept— I mean in the
spiritualist sense. I am sure we survive. I am not at all sure that
we can ‘ return9 at séances, twang the banjo, and shove the
furniture about. And yet, at séances, the banjo is twanged
paranormally, and the furniture becomes volatile. May there
not be an unknown force, either physical or spiritual, that
can do these things? I think there is. Another problem for
Science !
I think it was Goethe who wanted ‘ Light, more light.9 I too
want more light, and more evidence, before I can accept the
‘ survival9 theory of the spiritualists. Does Borley supply this
evidence? Perhaps, and the spiritualists may be right after all!
In The Most Haunted House in England1 I state that ‘ The spirit
hypothesis— that is, the continuity of personality and the power
to communicate after death— covers most of the facts. The
“ forms,9
9 the “ nun," the “ shadows," and other figures seen at
Borley by so many people at different times perhaps once be­
longed to living incarnate beings.9 If, six years ago, I came to
the conclusion that I could find no better explanation of some
of the Rectory phenomena than the popular ‘ survival9theory, I
unhesitatingly declare that I am still of that same opinion. A
further six years9 study of the phenomena, and of all the new
evidence that has accrued during this period, still more streng­
thens my belief that a more reasonable solution is not yet avail­
able. I would even go so far as to state that the Borley case
presents a better argument for ‘ survival9 than that of any
similar case with which I am familiar. But I, personally, still
feel that I want something more. I want scientific proof that the

and women. Whether such scientific proof is possible is another—^
matter; but Science must try to solve the riddle.
I began this chapter by stating that I did not intend to discuss
the many theories of cghosts5 postulated by philosophers and
others. But, what is much more to the point, I will present to
the reader some views and suggestions put forward by students
and those who have studied the Borley hauntings from a dis­
passionate angle. Their speculations are novel, interesting,
ingenious, and— in some cases— even exciting. Into the last-
named category can be placed a very modern ‘ view of ghosts’
that was sent to me by Mr Percy Pigott, of Eagle House, Kirk
Ella, Hull, on February 12, 1941. Here it is:
A N e w V iew of G hosts
D ear M r Price,
I have just been reading your most interesting book. The Most
HauntedHouse inEngland. I have no doubt it brings you a great deal
of correspondence. The reason I write is because in your chapter,
‘ Can the Phenomena be Explained?’ you say that if you were
asked to explain6the coach, the noise ofgalloping hoofs, the appear­
ance of the bay horses, the glittering harness, the light in the
window, etc.9you can only say 61 do not know,9and you add, ‘ no
one knows.5
Yet this appears to me as the least mysterious and the most easily
explained of all the extraordinary phenomena you not only
describe, but produce an abundance of evidence to support. Let
me explain.
Is it not possible that the substance which pervades all space,
interpenetrating and enveloping our earth and our bodies, which
scientists simply name ether, but do not pretend to explain, is
capable of receiving and retaining pictures of our actions and the
sounds which emanate from such actions, and even of reproducing
them when conditions are favourable, as, for instance, the evening
light, the temperature, and the weather generally?
In other words, this little understood substance is perhaps
capable of acting as a photographic negative. This is simply what
a cinema film does. It reproduces form, motion, and sound* Why
should not Nature also do it? May we not have a mirage of a past
event aswell as ofa distant scene? The fact that we always associate
u
306 t h e e n d o f b o r l e y r e c t o r y
motion with consciousness has subjected us to an error of interpreta­
tion.
If this is so it seems feasible that those events which have been
accompanied by intense feeling and concentrated thought, such as
accompany the great tragedies o f life, should be more deeply im­
pressed and therefore more clearly reproduced than those which
are performed unheedingly and habitually.
Thus I have heard of a street in London where the sound of
running footsteps is sometimes heard. I am told also that the
hearer gets the impression that these footsteps are being panic-
driven. Over this pavement a murderer once fled from the crime
he had committed. Which is the more reasonable: to suppose that
the murderer is constantly running again and again over this pave­
ment, and that though his body is invisible his footsteps are audible,
or to suppose that the Original sound is simply being reproduced?
Again, I have heard that Ann Bullen still haunts Hampton Court
and that the sound of her footsteps and the wail of her anguish as
she fled from her husband, having failed to obtain the mercy she
had been pleading for, are heard at certain times. Her form may
have been seen, I do not know. Is it not incredible to suppose that
Ann Bullen has been thus employed, at intervals at least, for four
hundred years? It is not in the least incredible, in these days of
gramophones and radio, to believe that the sound o f her distressed
wail can be, and is at times, reproduced.
Thus the coach, the galloping hoofs, the bay horses, the glittering
harness, are all real in that they are an objective actuality;- but the
observer is mistaken if he thinks he is viewing real horses or a driver
consciously directing them. The name, a ‘ spectre,’ a ‘ phantom,’
literally applies. This theory would also account for the nun. (I
think there is generally reason to be sceptical of ghosts being con­
scious egos after the lapse of a number of years after passing over.)
It would also account for the light in the window. It could account
for all the noise of footsteps, shufflings, scrabblings, tappings, thuds,
etc. Is it not significant that no one ever spoke to the nun? Had
they approached her for this purpose she would probably have
vanished, the necessary distance, or angle, for seeing this mirage
having been altered.1It would then have been regarded as uncanny.
Is it not significant also that no ghost o f any sort was seen to account
for the footsteps, thuds, etc., which were heard? Is it reasonable to
suppose that spirits, or ghosts, who pass silently through solid walk,
should make such a noise with their feet? I submit, it is more
^1 This is exactly what happened when the four Misses Bull saw the nun, insun­
light, on July 28, 1900. Miss Elsie approached the phantasm—which instantly
vanished (see pp. 28 and 30).—H.P.
W H A T IS A P O L T E R G E I S T ? 3 0 7
reasonable to regard these noises as being echoes o f an ancient
tragedy.
This, however, will not account for the messages on the wall,
stone-throwing, fiumiture-moving, bottle-dropping, -hair-ruffling,
bell-ringing, belt-raising, etc. For these phenomena I accept your
theory o f Poltergeists, and o f course it is possible that the Polter­
geists accounted for all the noises in the house. But to give a mystery
a name does not always explain it. What is a Poltergeist? You
refer to cthese playful little fellows.’ For my part, I cannot regard
a Poltergeist as in any sense a being. In my judgment, we should
be more correct to regard it as a vaguely conscious, instinctual,
elemental force. Such elemental force may emanate from, and in
the Borley case certainly has emanated from, the distress and rest­
lessness o f some departed human being. It is fully charged with
power, but power only for one sole purpose— namely, o f expressing
this restlessness and distress on the physical plane in the hope of
receiving help from the place where its trouble originated. The
vagueness o f its consciousness is shown by the feeble effort either to
write or compose a simple sentence or understand one. If you ask
me how could a blind force throw stones or ring bells I can only
reply that neither you nor I can claim to know all the laws o f nature,
and that these phenomena are evidence o f such a law. Because
there are no visible hands it is not, therefore, necessary to postulate
invisible ones. The Egyptians were supposed to be able consciously
to charge objects with such a force, and there is some evidence to
support this.
The headless driver is more difficult to account for. I notice
there are only two witnesses of this. I will not question the honesty
o f their testimony, but suggestion might account for it. They see
what they believe to be a ghosdy coach, ghosts are associated with
tragedies and beheadings, immediately they see the driver headless.
This is quite easy when viewing a mirage, which I am suggesting
this was.
Another method for accounting for this very gruesome apparition
is along the following lines:
There is little doubt that at some time there was a cruel tragedy
at Borley in which a group of people were involved. Both the
apparitions and the Poltergeist manifestations would have their
origin in this tragedy, in which the coachman would be concerned
and may have lost his head. Then he might very likely think of
himsplf as headless after passing over. It is well known that all
apparitions o f the living are caused by the subject thinking o f him­
self as with a distant friend or in a distant place, and thus he projects
his form to that place and it is occasionally seen and even heard.
30tf THE END OF BORLEY RECTORY
Now I have heard, and I can well believe, that it is much easier
for the so-called dead thus to project their appearances than the
living. I am confident that many apparitions of those recently
departed occupying their accustomed chair or walking down a
certain path with their own particular gait are due to their thinking
of themselves thus occupied after passing over. Perhaps the coach­
man thus pictured himself as headless.
Finally there is, in my judgment, the most remarkable of all
phenomena— matter passing through matter. This is not unknown
at spiritualist séances. It puzzles chemists. cIf it is true,9 I once
heard a chemist say, ‘ it overthrows all our ideas about matter.9
But do chemists, or anyone else, know what constitutes the solidity
of matter? Another chemist, who was also an occult student,
when I asked him what made a wall solid and impassable,
replied, ‘ Thought.5 I believe he was right. We think of things
as solid, and solid they are to us. But our Poltergeist friends may
not have been subject to those illusions of sense to which we
humans are.
This is a long letter. I hope I have not wearied you. I will close
by using your own words and applying them to myself. ‘ I do not
know.9 These are just my speculations.
Mr Pigott mentions Poltergeists, ‘ entities5*accepted5by many
persons who scoff at most of the phenomena associated with
psychical research. From whence do Poltergeists obtain the
energy with which to displace objects, smash windows, and
perform similar violent actions? The physicist, Mr A. J. B.
Robertson, M .A., who formed the Cambridge Commission of
inquiry into the Borley phenomena (see pp. 146-178), sent me
a lengthy essay, The Poltergeist Problem: A Physical View,1 from
which I take the following extracts :
Both the thermal and mechanical phenomena show considerable
evidence of being produced by some kind o f intelligence. In this
and in other respects an appreciable degree of correlation is notice­
able with the phenomena produced by physical mediums. Accord­
ing to one school of thought, physical mediums merely act as the
agents for definite entities or spirits entirely separate, in their normal
existence, from the mind of the medium, and the view is often
expressed that Poltergeists are mischievous spirits, possibly rather
undeveloped, which remain confined to a particular house or

POLTERGEISTS AND ENERGY 309
locality and are able to utilize certain people, especially adolescent
children, as physical mediums. O n the other hand, the activities of
physical mediums can be interpreted without the help of the spirit
hypothesis, since in many cases the apparent entities are equally
explicable as being secondary personalities o f the medium. In a
rather similar way one might regard a haunted house (in the
Poltergeist sense) either as the abode of a separate entity or spirit
of some kind, or as a place where for some unknown reason certain
people are able to exert some o f the powers possessed by physical
mediums. The connexion between the occurrence of Poltergeist
phenomena and the presence o f certain people at the same time,
and the possibility of Poltergeist phenomena taking place in the
absence of any persons, are matters requiring further investigation.
At the present time the evidence seems to rather favour the view
that a Poltergeist is at least a partially independent entity.
In order to produce objective phenomena, such as the throwing
o f kitchen crockery, a Poltergeist has to exert force of some kind,
and it would in fact appear that Poltergeists have access to some
form o f energy. The basic assumptions made here are that Polter­
geist phenomena are real and not fundamentally dissimilar to
ordinary physical processes involving energy changes, so that the
thermodynamics of Poltergeists is a definite problem to be con­
sidered— at least, for a start—in the normal scientific way. One
might tentatively suggest three sources o f energy as being available
to a Poltergeist. First there is the adolescent child. In numerous
cases it has been noticed that phenomena are produced most
vigorously when the child is lying or sleeping in bed. The condi­
tions may then be rather favourable for the removal of energy
from the child by the Poltergeist; the child under these conditions
approaches more closely the state of a medium when in trance. A
second possible source of energy is from the cooling of air and per­
haps other bodies. One cubic foot of air (at N .T.P.1) when cooled
through one degree o f Fahrenheit loses about fifteen foot-pounds
o f energy (this is the amount of work expended in lifting a fifteen-
pound object through a vertical distance of one foot). The cooling
of a small quantity of air therefore releases a considerable quantity
of energy. Such a process, although in agreement with the first
law of thermodynamics, would be a violation o f the second law
under some conditions. It follows from the second law that a
volume of air surrounded by a quantity o f air at the same uniform
temperature can only be cooled with respect to its immediate
surroundings by means o f some agency which does work and
1 Normal temperature andpressure—i.e., o° Centigrade and 760 mm. of mercury.
—H.P.
310 THE END OF BORLfiY RECTORY
thereby transfers the heat to some other place. In actual fact the
experimental evidence on temperature variations in haunted houses
is scanty, but both rises and falls in temperature have been noted.
It is not at all clear whether the Poltergeist can escape the restric­
tions of the second law, or alternatively can act in a manner similar
to that of a refrigerating machine.
A third possible energy source is suggested by an examination of
Poltergeist displacements themselves. In many cases it happens
that the object displaced finishes on a lower horizontal level than
it started from, its resultant movement being in a downward direc­
tion. An examination of some of the literature on Poltergeists
suggests that movements of objects downward are considerably
more frequent than movements upward. In general, therefore, a
Poltergeist displacement is accompanied by a decrease in potential
energy. At the same time it is noticed that the objects fall much
more slowly than they would do under the influence of gravity
alone, Now an object when falling in the normal way loses potential
energy which is converted into kinetic energy, and at any point on
the path of the falling object the potential energy lost is equal to the
kinetic energy gained (neglecting small order corrections). But
with Poltergeist manifestations this is clearly not the case: the
potential energy lost is only partially transformed into kinetic
energy, and hence part o f the potential energy is lost in some
unknown way—perhaps to the Poltergeist. This consideration
raises the general question of whether the Poltergeist can store
energy. If so, and if the store of energy is situated in a localized
region of space, it might perhaps be detectable with suitable
instruments. One might inquire whether the ccold spot5at Borley
w
Rectory has some special significance in this connexion, being a
localized region apparently having rather curious properties at
times.
When Mr Robertson expressed his opinion concerning how the
Poltergeist might obtain energy the public knew little of the
working of Radar and nothing at all about the atomic bomb. Is
it not possible that the entities under discussion may know more
than we do about splitting the uranium nucleus, and the disin­
tegration of atoms? They may know how to use electrons,
protons, neutrons, and positrons to their advantage in the dis­
placement of objects, and, especially, in the production of the
terrific bangs (mild atomic explosions?) so often heard in Pol­
tergeist infestations. They may employ the atomic energy in
SUBHUMAN E N E R G I E S 311
the sun, or cosmic energy, in order to serve their purpose.
Poltergeists may be able to 'tap5Nature’s safe-deposit and obtain
all the energy they require for their violent manifestations. N ot
m any atoms would have to be split to enable the entities to hurl
a few wine bottles or to jerk the baby on to the fire. So perhaps
the secret o f Poltergeist energy will be discovered not by the
psychical researcher, but by the nuclear physicist!
Canon Phythian-Adams also tells us what he thinks Poltergeists
are. H e says:1
The truth is, I suppose, that we shall have to make up our
minds, one way or the other, as to what the ' entity5is with which
or with whom we are dealing. The frequent failure of exorcism
seems to be another argument in favour of the human explanation.
It failed, for example, at Borley because what was wanted was
not the exorcism of an evil spirit but the quieting of a miserable
mind. It may have failed elsewhere for the same reason. There
are cases too where the infesting 'entity5is indifferent to any out­
ward and formal deterrents (blessed medallions, etc.), but yields
at once to the mere presence of a man o f real religion. •'This kind
cometh not out but by prayer and fasting.5 M y own impression,
after studying the evidence, is that all Poltergeist phenomena are
of human origin, and that they are connected with the life (and
death) history of the particular personality. The arcana o f ab­
normal psychology have still to be fathomed, but we already
know something of the powers which dislocation can unleash. I
should be quite prepared to learn that at the deepest level immense
subhuman (and morally neutral) energies can be tapped or Breed.
We are none o f us perhaps very far from these primeval pulsings
of life which some call the devil, and others the great god Pan.
Dominus sit adjutorium nostril
A Roman Catholic view of the hauntings was sent to me
(April 25, 1941) by Mr Sidney A. Paris, a civil engineer, of
62 Cornwall Road, Bishopston, Bristol. He says:
Much o f the story has no doubt interested me because of its
Catholic atmosphere, and, if I may, I would like to speculate on
the possible causes of the manifestations.
The following are the main ghostly actors:
1. The nun.
2. The monk.
1 ‘ Plague of Darkness,1in the Church Quarterly Review (London, Jamiary-March
I94^)» pp. 204-218.
312 THE END OF BORLEY RECTORY
3. The coach and headless man.
4. The Rev. Harry Bull.
5. Poltergeists, etc.
The first thing that strikes me is a kind o f £chain development.5
There seems to be some cause selecting persons out of different
historic periods and making them ‘ earth-bound5at this spot. For
example, the nun, the coachman, and the Rev. Harry Bull are of
different periods.
Now, in these phenomena one is obviously dealing with some­
thing on the borderland of the physical universe, if not with a spirit
world, and for this reason the method of physical science is im­
mensely useful in collating the physical factors involved. However,
I suggest that when attempting to reduce to order the ‘ spirit5or
non-material aspects, a different tool is wanted since physical
science is by its nature incapable o f penetrating there. I suggest,
therefore, the method of philosophy and the science of theology.
Basing ourselves, therefore, on the Philosophia Perrinis, which was
good enough for Aristotle, St Thomas Aquinas, etc., it can be shown
from purely natural reasoning that the human being has a spiritual
soul which (apart from a direct act of annihilation by God Himself)
is indestructible. . . .
Natural reason, then, proves the possibility of the existence of
discamate souls.
For the existence of spirits, both good and evil, and for the exis­
tence of Hell, Heaven, and Purgatory, we must turn to the Revela­
tion of God. This is taught by the Church.
I incline to the view that, in the case of the nun at least, you are
dealing with a personality (i.e., a being having intelligence and will).
The cnun5 may be either a human soul or a good or evil spirit
(non-human). The shape that we see cannot be the soul on the
above reasoning, but must needs be tenuous matter borrowed per­
haps from the observers, and especially ‘ families,5who inhabit the
house. In your Fifty Tears o f Psychical Research1you have tried, for
example, to photograph with infra-red light the ectoplasmic arms
issuing from mediums.
What started this trail o f psychic activity I cannot pretend to
say. But I would hazard the general story as follows:
The nun may have beeen murdered or died suddenly and her sins
may have required, under the mysterious workings of justice, that
she remain ‘ earthbound5under certain conditions. I do not know
enough about Purgatory to say whether it is a place or a state or
both. As ‘ Tim e5is involved I see no serious objection to place, but
1London (1939)5.pp. 104-106.—H. P.
P H E N O M E N A A R E C E A S I N G 3*3
a Catholic priest should be consulted if more accurate information
is required. It seems possible that only a Mass said on the spot
might be the condition of her release, and for this reason it might
be an act o f charity to arrange for a Mass to be said as she indeed
seems to have pleaded.
As regards the nuisance value o f Poltergeists, it may be that
these are not human entities, but it is also possible that certain
persons connected with the old priory (not necessarily monks) may
have remained earthbound in a similar way to the nun. Henry V III
probably despoiled the priory and a number of peasants probably
lost their livelihood as a consequence, as well as the monies. Some
of these may have retained feelings of revenge which they expressed
on the successors of the usurpers who built a rectory on their old
foundations. As an indication o f this I would suggest that since
Holy Week and the relic o f the Curé d’Ars were respected, this
seems to argue the presence of intelligences who are imbued with
Catholicism. Mrs Foyster may have received the worst blows per­
haps because she wras more psychic. The nun, who presumably is
not of the same period (1667) as the monastery (Bures1), could
appeal to Mrs Foyster, perceiving perhaps her powT
ers and sym­
pathy. I would rather doubt, however, the existence of convents in
1667 or even twenty or so years previously. Planchette here comes
under suspicion; however, it is not intrinsically impossible.
As the reader knows, Masses have been said for the mm, and
the phenomena appear to have ceased— or are ceasing. I agree
that Poltergeists are not human entities.2 They may be spirits
of a different order, a view taken by Father Aidan Elrington,
O.P., in the Catholic Herald (November 22, 1940). He says:
‘ But what might the explanation be? Some theories are dis­
cussed, but no one theory can be advanced that covers all the
facts. There is the nun, the coach and horses on the one hand,
and on the other the so-called Poltergeist phenomena; the latter
may indeed be the work o f spirits, but the other phenomena
remain unexplained.9
M r M. Heuds, of Purley Downs Road, Sanderstead, Surrey,
raises (February 7, 1941) the old question o f how and why we
see ghosts clothed as in life. He has a theory:
1 As I have pointed out, it is doubtful whether a monastery (or convent) was ever
established at Borley or Bures.—H.P.
2 Wkat they are is discussed in Poltergeist overEngland*
314 THE e n d of b o r l e y r e c t o r y
I f certain people see the dead ‘ fully clothed’ it might be due tothe
fact that the dead themselves project on our brain the thought—or
the way—in which they want us to see them, as they knew them­
selves to be whilst on earth— that is, fully clothed. And these
thoughts projected on our brain have such a 'force that they
exteriorize themselves, and we get a ‘ thought-form’ only, as it were,
so much so, that if we try to move towards the ghost it suddenly
vanishes (which a solid thing could not do). And why? Because
the fact of our moving towards it disturbs the very elements malring
the apparition in that way possible.
More than one correspondent has commented upon the fact
that so many clergy were involved in the Borley hauntings. This
is true. It is also true that clergymen, as percipients, have been
concerned in countless cases of haunting and Poltergeist infesta­
tions. And the number o f rectories where Poltergeists have
manifested themselves is legion.1 Apropos of Borley, Mr H. E.
Adshead, whom I have previously mentioned in this volume,
remarked in his letter: ‘ You do not seem to notice that it is
clergymen who cause the big events! Even after the fire it was
two clergymen again.’ I assure M r Adshead that I did notice
the clergy connexion, even if I did not mention it. The Borley
story is almost completely centred on the clergy, their families,
priests, monks, nuns, and the Church generally— especially the
Roman Catholic Church. M r Adshead’s reference to ‘two
clergymen again’ after the fire is interesting. When the Rectory
was unoccupied and unfurnished Miss Ethel Bull’s clerical
friend was passing the building and ‘ heard an awful noise coming
from the house as though a lot o f furniture was being thrown
about. He was a bit scared and took himself off.’ 2 And on one
of the rare occasions when the Rev. A. C. Henning (who has
never resided at the Rectory) was using one of the large rooms
there for a parish meeting ‘ a picture suddenly dropped from its
nail on the wall and was smashed.’ 3
What is this nexus between priests and Poltergeists? Mr
Howard Spring has a theory. He says (CountryLife, December 18,
*942):
11have devoted an entire chapter to cPoltergeist-infested Rectories* in Poltergeist
everEngland.

P E R C I P I E N T S P R O D U C E P H E N O M E N A ? 3 1 5
It is strange to me how often Poltergeists appear in an ecclesiasti­
cal context. The Wesley family knew all about it at Epworth
Rectory: there was Borley; Mr Price writes1o f a Shropshire manor
house in which there were manifestations when a retired canon
took up residence; and of a Lancashire farm where consecrated
ground appears to have some bearing on the matter.2. . . M r Price
writes that the presence of a young girl in the house appears often
to be the exciting cause of these phenomena; and I have wondered
whether in these ecclesiastical precincts the poor ‘ flesh5 has been
tortured overmuch, leaving frustration to inhabit dark places.
I mentioned Captain V. M. Deane in Chapter III. He has
studied the Borley case for many years, and has been in close
contact with the principal witnesses. He too has a theory3
which is to the effect that the "percipients5 those who
witnessed the phenomena) may, in fact, be the "agents5
those through whom the phenomena were produced). These
agents may have been—in the case of the Foysters—the profes­
sional mediums that were called in (the Marks Tey "circle5), or
the other many witnesses, including the Foysters themselves,
may have been the unconscious source from which some un­
known physical power drew its energy in order to produce the
manifestations. In other words, those who saw the phenomena
actually produced them—though quite ignorant of the fact.
Captain Deane sums up:
A few definite conclusions may be drawn from the data at our
disposal. They are:
(I) Showers o f bottles and stones were produced by some incal­
culable spirit potential.
(II) This spirit was not altruistic, as it made itselfa real nuisance.
Nor was it malignant, as the amount of power exerted was sufficient
to kill all the witnesses, if so desired. Nor was it very intelligent, as
a modicum o f human intelligence would have enabled it to com­
municate a coherent recital o f its desires, history, or advice.
(III) Its knowledge o f the process o f "apporting5matter exceeds
human knowledge.
(IV) The fact that apparitions o f a nun have so frequently been

Jl6 THE END OF BORLEY RECTORY
seen establishes the fact that an original existed, even as a photo-
graph implies an original.
(V) The phenomena at Borley are more or less consistentwith the
actions one would expect from a demented female.
(VI) The successful laying of the ghost [by the Marks Tey
Circle], for a period o f two years, was based on the supposition that
the cause of the trouble was a demented female, and it is easier to
believe that successful results were obtained from a right assump­
tion than from a wrong assumption.
(VII) If the demented nun theory is correct, then the theory of
a future life is correct, but a future life which is not necessarily all
‘ Peace, perfect peace.5 And so my last words to those who reject a
future life and future punishment are 4Beware! Beware! Beware!5
D r C. E. M . Joad too studied the phenom ena and the condi­
tions under which they were produced. In the London Star
(O ctober 21, 1940) he sets forth his views, some o f which I
reproduce herewith. D r Joad visited Borley on July 28, 1937,
with interesting results. His article is entitled cWhat I think
about Ghosts5:
But who or what are these things? M r Price thinks on the whole
that the spirit hypothesis is the most plausible, but the spirit hypo­
thesis does not necessarily mean that we survive as immortal souls
which on occasion assume visible form and produce movements of
material things. It may mean merely that something survives.
The human being, most of us are agreed, is not all body. In
addition, most of us would claim that as well as a body we have
minds or souls, but the mind or soul may not be a simple thing like
an element: it may be complex like a chemical compound resulting
from a mixture o f two elements, one the body, the other what, for
want of a better name, is sometimes called the psychic factor. At
death the compound is broken up and the mind, therefore, goes
out of existence.
But what of the elements of the compound? W e know what
happens to the body; it disintegrates and ultimately disappears.
But we do not know what happens to the psychic factor. It may
persist, at any rate for a time, and retain its power of combining
with a piece of matter to produce a temporary, though very elemen­
tary, intelligence.
It combines, for example, with the body of a medium in a trance
to form the temporary mind which sends ‘ spirit5messages; it may
even combine with pieces o f matter other than human bodies to
C
WE CAN MAKE OUR OWN GHOSTS5 317
produce the moving of small objects, the rapping on tables, the
ringing of bells, and the other phenomena usually ascribed to
Poltergeists.
Fantastic and far-fetched? No doubt, but is it any more so than
the facts which it is designed to explain?
In my previous monograph I did venture upon a theory that
might explain hauntings in general— or at least some of them. I
said that perhaps some of the phenomena at Borley cwere caused
by the persisting remnants of the egos or personalities, with
some portion of intelligence still retained, of persons who once
were associated with the Rectory, or with some building formerly
on the same site. The Rectory, I think, is— or was up to the
time of its destruction by fire— saturated with such emanations.5
It was a guess, but as one guess is as good as another, I made no
apology for putting it forward.
The Rev. R. W. Maitland, Vicar of Darsham, Suffolk, read
my book and, in a thought-provoking article which he calls ‘ an
explanatory theory,5 elaborates my views. He says (Lights
January 23, 1941):
How, then, can we account for the many appearances o f the nun
and the coach—and, indeed, of all the other phenomena which fill
the book?
M y theory is this; the house was built and immediately lived in—
this is an important point—by a man who undoubtedly was a
psychic. Very likely, his family, a large one, inherited his powers—
some certainly did; and so, to use M r Price’s words, the house
became saturated with their emanations; though this psychic
power, as I understand it, contained no ‘ persisting remnants of
egos’ or any intelligence of itself. It remained for those living in
the house to use that power as their minds or subconscious minds
desired.
In other words, given the proper conditions, we can make our
own ghosts. I have proved that for myself much nearer home than
Borley. And so it was then with regard to the nun and phantom
coach and galloping horses and ghosdy sounds and all the rest o f it.
If such things are associated with haunted houses, as they are,
then the imaginative mind (conscious or subconscious) o f the
percipient can create them anywhere, provided, as I have said,
there is sufficient psychic power to work upon.
All these strange phenomena are veridical in the sense of which
l8 THE END OF BORLEY RECTORY
F. W . H. Myers uses the word—i.e.9 there is an external origin of
an internal vision. Something outside themselves causes the perci­
pients to see such things.
At this point some people, no doubt, will say: ‘ But what about
the flying bottles and the apported coat and the gold ring?9 I see
no reason why that same psychic power which had been accumu­
lating in the house for so many years may not have produced all
this when acted upon by a Sensitive such as Mrs Foyster certainly
was— an unconscious one, no doubt, but a very potent one for all
that. After all, those o f us who have seen a demonstration of
telekinesis have seen the same thing.
Up to now we have done without ‘ spirits9
— that is to say, dis­
embodied spirits. I use the word ‘ disembodied9 advisedly, for I
maintain that we are spirits here and now and that our psychic
power is evidence of it. There is no reason to deny, however, that
those on the Other Side have played a part in the strange happen­
ings of Borley Rectory.
It is very significant that M r Price took part in a séance on his
first visit there, and that M r Harry Bull purported to come through;
and significant also that he had declared in his lifetime that he
would be justified in making himself known after death by physical
means, if he so wished.
One word more. On laying down the book one is conscious of a
feeling that it adds unnecessarily to the terrors of death. One can
. imagine the comments which some people would make upon read­
ing it— ‘ weird, uncanny, gruesome;9and it is for this purpose that
I have put forward the theory that many of the terrors which
surround it are o f man’s own making, the mysterious working of
his own mind under the stimulus of some external power.
The house was an ideal one for that purpose. It was brand new
when M r Henry Bull moved into it, filling it with his psychic power
and that of a rapidly growing family, who remained in possession
for between sixty and seventy years, and so produced ‘ The most
haunted house in England.9
M r W . Harrison disagrees with the Rev. R . W . Maitland. In
an ‘ answer9 (Light, April 24, 1941), from which I take some
extracts, M r Harrison sets forth his reasons:
The suggestion that the phantoms seen probably originate in the
minds of living persons inhabiting haunted houses at, or near, the
time of the occurrences is certainly not borne out by the facts
ordinarily found to exist. The phantoms seen are almost in­
variably those of persons who formerly inhabited the places, and
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY 319
are frequently o f a period of time long prior to the date o f their
manifestation. They are often quite outside the knowledge o f the
living witnesses, and their identity is often reasonably established
by reference to local historical facts not previously known to such
witnesses. The stories or legends associated with the hauntings
may sometimes originate in the earliest occasions of their appear­
ance, or may be entirely independent o f them.
In the case of the Borley hauntings there is no evidence to show
whether any such stories were current locally, or known to the
members o f the Bull family prior to their first seeing the appari­
tions:1 nor is there any shred of reason for supposing the Rev.
Harry Bull was in the habit of inventing ideas of this kind, or
that he had ever, by an act of will and imagination, succeeded in
creating a phantom visible to himself or other persons. On the
contrary, in narrating his experiences of the phantoms to others,
he expressed his bewilderment at what he had seen.
Accounts of the hauntings indicate that at times the apparition
of the nun displayed cognizance of the presence of the witnesses—
see the statement o f Miss Ethel Bull (The Most Haunted House in
England, p. 45) that when she pursued the gliding figure o f the
nun it stopped and turned towards her with an expression o f intense
grief on its face, and then vanished.
There have been published many other theories, views, and
speculations concerning the Borley hauntings, and for these I
must refer the reader to the Bibliography/
I have barely mentioned the psychological 'explanations.5 I
have had many letters from psychiatrists, neurologists, psycho­
logists, and chemists. They suggest that the phenomena can
be explained in terms of 'unconscious mind5 phenomena,
'sub-conscious mind5 phenomena, and in atomic physics. In
other words, that the clue to the paranormal can be found in
the normal— or slightly abnormal. These materialists suggest
that the Borley manifestations perhaps can be explained by the
behaviour of the mind, especially the subconscious mind. But
not one has sent me a real explanation. And not one of their
theories covers the objective phenomena, of which there are many.
Their conjectures are of academic interest only, and do not get

us very far, and I cannot fit them into the Borley puzzle without
jettisoning many known hard fa cts.
Then there is the theory that every one who experienced the
R ectory phenomena crossed a sort o f enchanted boundary,
suddenly became ‘ clairvoyant,’ and saw the actual— though
subjective— scenes as they were enacted hundreds o f years ago.
In other words, that large blocks o f personal experience were
displaced from their proper position in Tim e for their benefit.
This is reminiscent o f the famous ‘ visions’ seen by Miss C.
Anne E. M oberly and Miss Eleanor F. Jourdain during their
exciting trip to Versailles in 1901.1 W e cannot say. What we
can say, with certainty, is that we know nothing o f the mechanics
— spiritual or physical— o f these ‘ miracles.’
Speaking o f the spiritual aspect o f these phenomena, it is signi­
ficant that in the Report o f the Archbishop o f Canterburys Committee on
Spiritualism seven out o f the ten members o f the Committee agreed
that the spiritualists have made out a very strong case for the
survival o f personality after death, and ‘ communications’ from
the dead. The Committee began its investigations in 1937, and
a printed Report was circulated privately a year or two later. It
has never been issued to the public, though the names of the
members o f the Committee, and their principal conclusions, were
recorded in the psychic Press at the time.

CHAPTER XXII
ONLY ONE CONCLUSION
O ’er all there hung the shadow of a fear,
A sense of mystery the spirit daunted,
And said, as plain as whisper in the ear,
The place is Haunted!
T homas H ood
I
BEGAN the last chapter by stating that, ‘Assuming that the
phenomena are genuine. . Are they, in fact, genuine? Were
the manifestations, attested by some two hundred witnesses
during the past sixteen years, of true paranormal origin?
As it is all a question of evidence, we will take ‘ counsel’s
opinion.’ In the Law Times for August 9, 1941, is a leading
article by Sir Ernest Jelf, who was then Senior Master o f the
Supreme Court, and King’s Remembrancer from 1937 to 1943.
He studied my previous monograph and has kindly permitted
me to reprint his conclusions, which he too calls ‘ A Question of
Evidence’ :
One of the most remarkable books of marvels, put forward as
being literally true, which was everpublished, hasrecentlyappeared
nnrW the Pams of The Most Haunted House in England, by Harry
Price.
Those of us who all our lives have spent a large part of our
working hours in courts of law, seeking to ascertain what is and
what is not worthy of belief, will be staggered by the appeal, which
this book makes, that we shall believe things more contrary to the
ordinary experience of mankind than we could ever have dreamed
of before.
And at the end ofthe book the author fairly enough throws out a
challenge: ‘ Readers of this monograph are now in possession o f the
evidence I have accumulated for the alleged haunting of Borley
Rectory: and it is for them to decide— injury— whether in fact
the place is haunted or not. It is all a question o f Evidence.
Shall we take up the challenge?
The legal profession will not accept the paragraph which I have
x 32i
322 THE END OF BORLEY RECT ORY
cited as quite accurately stating the position. W e are in the position
of counsel, who has his brief, with proofs o f all the witnesses, and
who is asked to advise whether the case is one which would pro­
bably convince a jury. W e are not in the position o f a jury which,
has heard the evidence. There is from the point o f view of a legal
trial no cevidence5 as yet. Each o f the witnesses who has given
a proof would— in a legal trial— have to be examined, and that
without leading questions. Witnesses— especially those who speak
o f marvellous things—seldom quite ‘ come up to their proofs.5 And
the story which they do tell is in turn subject to cross-examination.
By the end o f the process the story told in the box will differ in many
respects from the story told in the proofs. Therefore we are not as
yet in the position of a jury which has heard the evidence.
But let us suppose that we are asked, as counsel might be asked,
whether, upon the perusal o f the proofs, there is a good chance of
substantiating the case which these proofs are designed to support.
On this understanding we can only say that they do present a
very strong case indeed— stronger than most of us could ever have
believed possible before we had read the book. There are more
than a hundred witnesses, most of whom are still alive and avail­
able, including many persons o f position and of intellectual attain­
ment. And many of them were called in as unprejudiced outsiders,
on purpose to see whether they would by their own experience
corroborate the witnesses who had gone before.
And what is it that they are to prove? This one ‘ most haunted
house in England5can boast not only o f ‘ ghosts’ as usually under­
stood, but of marvellous Poltergeists who moved objects about and
produced eexhibits5which were there for all to see— to say nothing
of the wonders of table-turning and Planchette.
Let us begin with cghosts,5 as usually understood. Long before
this book even reasonable men were obliged to admit that ghosts
have been positively asserted to have appeared in precisely similar
shape to many witnesses. In the classic phrases attributed by
Boswell to Johnson, ‘ All reason is against it. All experience is for
it.5 What, however, were these phenomena? Deceased persons
apparently seen and heard. But deceased persons are seen and
heard in dreams. It is, we submit, unnecessary to suppose that a
body of flesh and blood has been resurrected and that their clothes
have been preserved fresh through the ages. The phenomena would
appear to be more analogous to those of dreams. Things are seen
and heard in dreams. But no waves of aether corresponding to the
vision strike the retina o f the eye; no vibrations o f air corresponding
to the auricular impression reach the drum of the ear. Dreams,
‘ A STRONG CASE5 333
besides ghosts, are sometimes ‘ veridical’ and correspond with some
actual facts. Dreams, besides ghosts, are often common to many
people. If that were the only marvel o f 4the most haunted house
in England^ it would be amazing enough; but it would be nothing
new nothing that does not resemble some story that has been told
to us by an aunt or an aunt’s friend, if not personally experienced.
M r F* W . H. Myers writes o f such a case,4Although the experience
came to him in visual terms, I do not suppose that it was really
optical— that it came through the eyes.’
But what proofs of the witnesses in this book show are Poltergeist
manifestations, the spontaneous displacement o fobjects (telekinesis),
the appearance and disappearance of objects within the house, the
spontaneous combustion of various parts o f the house, the changing
o f wine into ink, sudden thermal variations, and inexplicable scents
and odours. W e have said enough to indicate the nature o f the
stories told by more than a hundred witnesses. Full details are
given in the book. These stories stand on a perfectly different level
from the ordinary ghost story, inasmuch as the 4Poltergeist’ is a
hypothesis to account for a force which can produce actual physical
and chemical changes in matter, as for instance when things are
thrown about, when wine is changed into ink, and when writings
inexplicably appear and remain upon a wall.
After making every allowance for what we have said about
witnesses not coming up to their proofs and so forth, a very strong
case has undoubtedly been put forward, and we are at a loss to
understand what cross-examination could possibly shake it. Any
cross-examination would probably be based on the lines suggested
by Coué’s Suggestion and Autosuggestion—but this is really to submit
that the witnesses have imagined the whole thing. But a hundred
imaginers! But imaginers o f position and intellectual repute!
Imaginers brought from outside to come fresh to the examination
as independent persons!
And then there are the dogs. The reaction o f the dogs certainly
seemed to show that they too saw some o f the strange sights and
heard some o f the strange sounds o f Borley Rectory. Did they
imagine them?
There is one peculiar feature which has run through the ghost
stories o f all time— the deep interest which the spectres always take
in the burial or other disposal of their corpses. From the Ghost o f
Elpenor in Hades described by Homer and the sailor in Horace’s
famous ode, the same idea comes down to Borley Rectory through
hundreds o f intermediate similar stories. Any theory to account
for the facts must reckon with it.
324 THE END OF BORLEY RECTORY
It will be very interesting if one of these days the truth of some
such story as that of Borley Rectory becomes relevant to some issue
in a legal trial—it is not impossible to imagine such an eventuality.
What would the jury say? They would probably disagree.
A good deal has happened since Sir Ernest Jelf’s article
appeared in the Law T im s , and I must emphasize that his
verdict as to the paranormality of the phenomena was based
on a perusal of my first book on Borley: he knew nothing whatso­
ever of the vast and important additional evidence, supplied by
an additional hundred witnesses, which is published in the
present volume. If, in his considered judgment, he gave as his
opinion that the proofs ‘ do present a very strong case indeed,’
what will be his reaction to the great weight of fresh evidence
that I am now submitting to the reader?
We will take another counsel’s opinion, that of one of the most
distinguished jurists of our generation, Sir Albion Richardson,
K.G., C.B.E.
Sir Albion, who is Recorder of Nottingham (and was M.P.
for Peckham from 1910 to 1922), has been Chairman of many
Government judicial committees, and his whole career has.been
devoted to determining what is and is not evidence. He studied
the Borley records as published in my earlier monograph, and
kindly sent me for publication the following appreciation of the
case:
Borley Rectory stands by itself in the literature of psychical
manifestation. Wisely discarding theories of causation (which in
these matters are little better than conjecture), the author, Mr
Harry Price, sets out to prove by the cumulative evidence of eye­
witnesses—recorded in a form which would be admissible in
evidence in ‘any court of law—the happening of events at Borley
Rectory which it is impossible to explain by the operation of
natural law.
The large number of the public who are interested in these
things are under a debt of gratitude to him, for without his untiring
energy and skilled experience as an investigator, the story of Borley
Rectory would have remained unrevealed, and a fascinating
chapter in the history of psychical research would have been lost
to the world.
C
. . . TO THE POINT OF MORAL C E R T A I N T Y 5 325
The evidence which he has collected o f the phenomena which
appeared there is as conclusive as human testimony can ever be,
and is admirably marshalled. I have not met anyone who has
read The Most Haunted House in England (and it is mainly with legal
friends of long experience in the weighing and sifting of evidence
that I have discussed it) who has not been satisfied that the mani­
festations therein disclosed are proved by the evidence, to the point
of moral certainty. Many of these friends were, like myself, pre­
viously sceptical.
In view of the legal opinions printed above, plus the evidence
of two hundred witnesses, and what I have seen with my own
eyes, there is only one conclusion at which I can arrive: the
Borley phenomena (or most of them) occurred in the way
they were said to occur; they were of paranormal origin; they
have been scientifically proved; and, as Sir Albion Richardson
emphasizes, the evidence for their paranormality 6is as con­
clusive as human testimony can ever be.5 Fraud, malobserva-
tion, exaggeration, natural causes, and trickery— conscious, un­
conscious, or subconscious— could not have accounted for the
phenomena.
But if we have, from the legal angle, proved that the Borley
phenomena are, in fact, genuine there are other major questions
that cannot be decided with the same certainty. For example,
although we have unimpeachable first-hand evidence that an
apparition of a nun has been seen at Borley by many people, for
almost a century, we have no real evidence at all that it was she
— or it— who was responsible for the many varieties of pheno­
mena that have been seen, heard, or experienced at the Rectory.
And there must have been many entities at work there. Again,
if we have little evidence that the nun was responsible for any
of the manifestations, we have no scientific evidence that the name
of the nun was cMarie Lairre3 or that her remains were found
under the cellar floor. We hose scientific evidence that part of
these remains belonged to a young woman, and circumstantial
evidence (the Planchette messages, wall-writings, pendants,
cpointers,5etc.) that the bones belonged to a young French nun
named 'M arie Lairre5 or 'Larre.5
326 THE END OF BORL EY RECTORY
T he F o u r N uns
But what complicates matters is the fact that we havtjour
‘ entities5claiming to be the nun-ghost ! W e have discussed4Marie
Lairre3 very fully in these pages. W e have discussed less fully
the second principal claimant, Arabella W aldegrave, because I,
personally, am not in possession o f sufficient evidence to warrant
treating that claim very seriously; and Canon Phythian-Adams
has demolished such arguments as have been put forward on her
behalf. T he suggestion is that Arabella, granddaughter of
James II (see Chapter X I I ), was a spy w ho was enticed from
France and murdered at Borley— perhaps by a relative. Dr
Phythian-Adams3s theory (Chapter X ), a m uch m ore acceptable
one, is that a young French nun, M arie Lairre, was inveigled
from France and murdered at Borley by a false lover or husband.
There is some evidence for this, circumstantial though it be. It
is not m y rôle to make an ex cathedra pronouncem ent on the
question— m y jo b has been to prove or disprove the phenomena,
and in this I think I have succeeded. M y interest in the identity
o f the nun is little more than academ ic. But I prefer the cfalse
lover3 theory to the ‘ royal spy3 hypothesis. ^ A nd the evidence
undoubtedly supports the former postulate.
As I have said, there are two other claimants to the honour of
haunting Borley, and I will now introduce them to the reader.
Both claims are nearly as unsubstantial as the ‘ entities3 making
them, but they must be recorded.
Captain V . M . Deane, previously mentioned in this mono­
graph, was a member o f the Marks T ey 1 Circle o f spiritualists,
and in his article, ‘ Borley R ectory Problems,32 he records part
o f the verbatim notes taken at a séance on A pril 26, 1932.
Apparently more than one m edium was present, but the princi­
pal psychic was a M r C. W . W arren, a local tradesman, now
deceased. Captain Deane says:3
Mr Warren was now controlled by the nun from the Rectory,
who, after making the sign of the Cross very reverently [and,
apparently, assuming the personality of the nun] indicated her veil

and rosary, holding out her hands as if showing the latter to the
sitters. She seemed very nervous and continually turned her head
as if asking advice from ‘ Zenith9 (spirit control), standing behind
M r Warren, and several times put up her left hand, as if holding
‘ Zenith’s9 hand for help. The sitters spoke very gently and kindly
to her, and persuaded her to write with Planchette, which she did
as follows: ‘ Virgin! Do forgive me! Oh, Mother of Jesus, help
me.9 (To the sitters) : ‘ How long since that living tomb? I did no
wrong: m y Father Confessor thought me guilty. Ah, the walls ! I
was thirsty and they gave me empty bottles ! Oh, those bottles ! I
do not know what has happened. Am I now to go to the Judgment
throne, the great white throne?9 (Mrs Warren: ‘ No, dear child.
Go with the lady [“ Zenith” ] who stands behind you and is helping
you now. She will take you to a place of rest and beauty. Your
terrible sufferings are over, put them out of your mind. You are
now going to progress in your new life and be very, very happy.9
[The nun]: ‘ What will the Father Confessor say? He will not
forgive me. Bring me spring flowers.9 (Mrs Warren brought a
bowl of primroses, and she [i.e., the medium, M r Warren] buried
her face in them, as if enjoying their fresh scent, and smiled, after
which she took a small bunch from the bowl, laid it on the table,
and relinquished control.
Captain Deane writes that in the Marks Tey records the name
of the nun is given as ‘ Evangeline Westcott,3 and a c
John
Westcott,5 presumably her father, is also mentioned. Captain
Deane says: ‘ As these names differ from those quoted in M r
Price’s book, and the existence of the nun, or any monastery or
convent, has not been established from local records, these items
can be pigeon-holed for the time being.5
It is not for me— and I am not competent— to question whether
the spirit of a Roman Catholic mm, in such a situation, would be
likely to use the mode of expression or words ascribed to her in
the séance records. A Catholic priest would know. The mediums
said that ‘ the trouble was due to a demented nun whose spirit
they would remove, and from that hour the trouble ceased for
nearly two years at Borley Rectory.9 I believe this to be true.
But the Rev. L. A. Foyster mentions in his diary that on the
morning ofJanuary 24, 1932, ‘ the house was entirely different
and, with two exceptions, ‘ demonstrations definitely stopped
until 1935.’
328 T H E EN D OF B O R L E Y R E C T O R Y
T h e ‘ Summer-h ou se’ N un
T he reader has already heard something o f the fourth claimant
to be the nun-ghost, in M r A . J. B. Robertson’s report on the
Cam bridge Commission (Chapter I X ). But little was said about
the inform ation obtained at this seance on July 22, 1944. It will
be rem embered that as the R ectory was non-existent, the five
members (P. Brennan, P. Brown, C. J. Lethbridge, R. G.
Watkinson, and D. W illiam s) o f the Commission who visited
Borley on the evening m entioned, were com pelled to take up
their quarters in the summer-house on the lawn, opposite the
Nun’s W alk. A t about 3.15 a .u . (July 23, 1944) ca considerable
number o f faint raps were heard.’ They were heard distinctly
by all five members o f the Commission, who arranged with the
‘ entity5 that they should use the follow ing code: one knock for
cYes,5 two for cN o,5 and three for ‘ Uncertain.5 By this means
com m unication was established with whatever was rapping,
.and intelligent answers were given to the interrogators5 verbal
questions. Both questions and answers were recorded at the
time.
Although M r Robertson in his report does not give these
questions and answers verbatim , I am fortunate in having the
com plete protocol o f this séance in the Borley dossier. Mr
Robertson sent it to m e on September 10, 1944. I will now select
some extracts from it:
Are you the ghost of the Rev. Harry Bull? No.
Can we help you? No.
Could a minister help? Tes.
Could a Roman Catholic priest help? [Four knocks, repeated.]
Could a Protestant minister help? No. [Promptly.]
Are you a Roman Catholic? [No answer.]
Have you ever done this before? Tes.
Have you ever given any help? No.
Did you ever ask for help? [No answer.]
Did you ever ask for help from the inmates of Borley Rectory? Tes.
Did you ask Mrs Foyster? [No answer.]
Did you talk to Miss Helen Glanville? Tes.
By Planchette? Tes.
Are you the nun buried at Borley Rectory? [No answer.]
329
THE RAPPI NG NUN
Are you a nun? [No answer.]
Are you a man? No.
Are you the ghost of a woman? Tes.
Are you the nun associated with Borley Rectory? [No answer.]
Are you a nun? Tes.
Did you come from the nunnery near Borley Rectory? [No answer.]
Was it at Borley Rectory? Tes.
Are you glad the buildings are destroyed? Tes. [Promptly,]
Did you receive Christian burial? [No answer.]
Were you buried as a nun should have been? [No answer.]
Were you murdered? [Uncertain.]
Have you a message for us? No.
Did you die about a .d . 1200, or in the thirteenth century? Tes.
Have you ever been helped by a minister? No.
Have you a message for anyone? No.
D o you object to the light? Tes. [Promptly.]
[With light extinguished.] Was it about 1250 when you died?
Tes.
Were you associated with the Benedictine monies? [No answer.]
Do you know o f Poltergeists here? Tes.
W ould it be possible for you to tell others? Tes.
D o you understand my questions? Tes.
Can you inform others? Tes.
Do you intend informing them? [Uncertain.]
Will you appear on July 28 [the traditional date on which the nun
is said always to appear] ? No. [One of the sitters was not certain
that this was the answer.]
Is it impossible? No.
Are you capable of Poltergeist activity? Tes.
Did you throw the earth on the summer-house? Tes.
Was it done to attract our attention? No.
Are there others? Tes.
Have you communication with them? Tes.
[There now followed either fifteen or eighteen knocks in quick
succession.]
Are you leaving us? [No answer.]
M r Robertson concludes his report by saying that there were
no further raps, and that the sitters all felt that the last series o f
knocks signified that the centitys would not again communicate.
He says the raps were quite faint, but were heard by all five
sitters without any difficulty.
I have only one comment to make, and that refers to the
330 THE END OF BORLEY RECTORY
question as to when the nun died. It was a ‘ leading question,1
and the answer was ‘ Yes.’ This question was obviously prompted
by knowledge of the traditions connected with the Rectory, and
the alleged monastery supposed to have once stood on its site. I
cannot help wondering whether, if for ‘ 1250’ the date ‘ 1667’
(the year in which ‘ Mary Lairre1 said she died) had been sub­
stituted, the answer would have been the same !
I have reckoned the summer-house nun as the ‘fourth’
claimant, but it may have been ‘ M ary Lairre’ communicating.
Curiously, the name of the ‘ entity’ was neither asked for nor
ascertained. But as this particular nun (she admitted she was
a nun) also claimed to have communicated with Miss Glanville
via Planchette, she may have been ‘ Marie Lairre’ after all.
That would reduce the number of our nun-ghosts to three.
There is yet another ‘ entity’ named ‘ M ary’ that I must men­
tion. In my M ost Haunted House in England (p. 81) Mr Foyster
records in his diary, under August 1931, that ‘ a medium and an
investigator’ visited the Rectory and held a séance: ‘ Different
spirits are tackled, among them one “Joe Miles.” ’ In a footnote
to this entry I state that I have no information concerning these
people.
During my visit to Borley in M ay 1945 Mr Henning introduced
me to Miss Mary E. Braithwaite, J.P., of Brook House, Long
Melford. This lady informed me that her brother, the late Mr
W. John Braithwaite, had an extraordinary sitting at the
Rectory in August 1931, and that if I approached her brother’s
widow, living at ‘ Greenwood,’ Bidborough Ridge, Tunbridge
Wells, she would perhaps allow me to peruse the voluminous
report of the séance that M r Braithwaite compiled at the time
from notes taken during the séance.
Mrs W. John Braithwaite very kindly sent me this report of
some 5000 words (the ‘ missing link’ that I required when I
wrote my previous monograph), and permits me to quote it. It
is a remarkable report in many ways. The séance was held at
Borley Rectory on August ix, 1931, and was attended by Mr
W. John Braithwaite, Mr Ernest Meads, and a M r Johnson, a
medium. There were also present the Rev. L. A. Foyster and,
‘m a r y ’ is rebellious 331
during part of the time, Mrs Foyster. The séance was a typical
spiritualist demonstration, and a number of ‘ entities’ ‘ came
through.’ As each ‘spirit’ presented itself, so the medium suc­
cessively assumed or absorbed his or her personality (as Mr
Warren did at Marks Tey), and conversed with the sitters in the
character of the entity. The séance, which lasted from six o’clock
to 10 p.m., was very impressive. The medium’s ‘ controls,’ or
‘ guides,’ were a Red Indian and a ‘ Dr Haslam, of Harley
Street,’ who died some years ago. The ‘ doctor’ diagnosed Mr
Foyster’s illness as rheumatism ‘ and told him to avoid potatoes,
and starchy foods, such as tapioca and sago,’ etc. The ‘ doctor’
also told the Rector that he suffered from depression, which Mr
Foyster admitted.
The next ‘ entity’ was a drunken ex-publican named ‘Joe
Miles,’ who kept calling for ‘ drinks all round’ and could not
be persuaded that he was dead. Asked whether it was he who
was causing all the trouble at the Rectory, ‘Joe Miles’ gave an
alcoholic grunt which was taken for assent.
Then the mf-dinm sighed and said ‘ Oh dear!’ and appeared to
cry [I am quoting from the report], T don’t know where I am.’
‘ Why, you’re dead,’ Meads cut in, and the spirit seemed to know
that. The medium kept sighing and crying in a high voice, T went
to London and I had a baby, and I murdered it.’ She gave her
name as ‘ Mary,’ and said she ‘ felt very rebellious’ because of the
cruelty with which she was met when she came back to the village.
She was turned out at night in the rain and slept under a hedge.
Meads went through the same effort to get her to pray and turn to
better things. She partly promised to do so.
A number of other ‘ spirits’ manifested themselves, and were
impersonated by the medium. It would tire the reader to give
an account of all these, but one of them, ‘John Wesley,’ really
was impressive. I again quote the report: ‘ And Wesley, if
Wesley it was, gave us a short inspirational sermon lasting some
five minutes . . . it was very well done, and much better than the
ordinary sermon, and much simpler, and in good language and
taste.’ The séance ended with the ‘ appearance’ of ‘ Cardinal
Newman’ !
THE END OF BORLEY RECT ORY

I have said somewhere in this volume that although I saw,
photographed, and reproduced several of the ‘ Marianne’ wall-
writings, I had never seen one of the many ‘ messages’ that were
written on scraps of paper and left about the house, or which
came ‘ fluttering down from nowhere.’ These messages were
similar to those scribbled on the walls.
Among M r Braithwaite’s effects was found a specimen of a
‘ paper-message,’ and his widow has kindly presented it to me. I
reproduce it as Plate X X V I. It is written on the back of an old
envelope. First there appeared the one word ‘ Marianne,’ which,
as the reader knows, is Mrs Foyster’s Christian name. The writ­
ing is identical in every way with the word ‘ Marianne’ of the
four wall-messages reproduced in this volume. Under the word,
on the envelope, Mrs Foyster wrote, ‘ What do you want?’ and
replaced the envelope where she found it. Shortly after, the word
‘ Rest’ was found written under the question.
I can say little more about Mr Braithwaite’s report, except that
he records many of the Rectory phenomena, accounts of which
I have already published. At the Rectory he saw at least twenty-
four ‘ curious old-fashioned coloured crockery egg-cups’ that
suddenly ‘ appeared.’ Neither M r Foyster nor his wife knew
where they came from. ‘ Twelve of these cups were thrown across
the room, denting the door, and falling without breaking.’ In
her covering letter Mrs Braithwaite informed me that from
childhood her husband had known Borley Rectory and the Bull
family, and heard of the haunting even in those early days.
I have discussed the evidence for the phenomena witnessed at
Borley Rectory, and the theories concerning the several nuns.
But I feel I must say a word or two about the various methods of
communication that have provided us with so much ‘ informa­
tion’ : the raps, the table-tipping, the wall-messages, Planchette,
etc. What is the real value of the information obtained by these
means? I, personally, would hesitate to place too much reliance
on them, and more than once in this monograph I have warned
the reader that he must assess their importance himself—accord­
ing to how he feels about it. But I can say this: that the raps I

heard at the séance in the early hours o f June 13, 1929, in the
R ectory ‘ Blue R o o m ,’ were genuine paranormal raps. It was m y
first visit to the R ectory, and there were several people present
in the bedroom , including two o f the Misses Bull and the R ev.
G. Eric Smith, the R ector, and his wife. The representative o f
the Daily M irror1 was also there. For three hours, in a well-lighted
room, raps were rained upon the large mahogany mirror on the
dressing-table, around which we sat, though we were not very
close to it. For three hours we received intelligent answers to our
questions (m ostly concerning the private affairs o f the Bull
family). Those raps were paranormal, and were not, and could
not, have been produced by any mortal present. And an intelli­
gence was behind those raps. M y point is, if the raps were
genuine, is it n ot possible— even probable— that the rapping
‘ entity5 was also genuine, and that the messages were genuine
too ? I f an ‘ entity5can com m unicate by rapping on the back o f a
mirror, then it is logical to suppose that the same ‘ entity5
— or
any ‘ entity5
— can com m unicate by scribbling on a wall or direct­
ing the lead pencil o f a Planchette board. Still further proof o f
the paranorm al nature o f the force at work in the ‘ Blue R oom 5
that night was the violent levitation o f a new cake o f soap from
its dish at the far end o f the closed room , twelve feet from any
sitter. T h e force propelling the soap was so powerful that the
cake was deeply dented as it struck the edge o f the water-ewer
in its fall. It was, perhaps, the most perfect Poltergeist pheno­
menon I have ever seen.
It has been suggested that the wall-messages were due more
to psychological causes than to paranormal ones. In other
words, that a hum an being unconsciously— or subconsciously—
wrote them . I f this be so, how can we account for the many
marks that appeared on these same walls, seven years later,
when sceptical observers were actually controlling the walls?
The marks appeared spontaneously, under scientific conditions
of control. I f an entity— discamate or other invisible— can
produce pencil marks in the form o f squiggles or Prince o f
Wales5Feathers (the W aldegrave crest?), under such conditions,
1 Sec Daily Mirror, June 14, 1929.

is it not logical that the same centity’ can write 'messages’ if it
has a m ind to? The answer must be eYes.’ W e need doubt the
'messages’ no longer.
As for the Poltergeist manifestations, the paranormally pro­
duced smells and odours, the tactile and auditory phenomena,
the apparitions o f the nun and other figures, sometimes seen by
several persons at one and the same time, in sunlight— as Sir
Albion Richardson says, these things have happened and the
evidence for them is cas conclusive as human testimony can
ever be . . . to the point o f moral certainty.’
A R e g r e t
M y only regret concerning the Borley case is that some univer­
sity department, or the R oyal Society, did not officially take the
R ectory under its wing, investigate the phenom ena indepen­
dently, and issue an official report on its findings. Unfortunately
the Borley hauntings occurred about fifty years too soon for official
Science, and it was left to disinterested investigators, at their
own expense, to put on record a com plete history o f the Rectory
phenomena. I f the Borley affair had been made public at the
end o f the twentieth century, instead o f at the beginning, some
university or other (probably Cam bridge, as it is so near) would
have sent their best physicists, psychologists, and physiologists to
the R ectory, and would have issued a voluminous report, ex­
plaining everything. I say this because I do believe that in fifty
years’ time we shall know a great deal more about these matters.
I often wonder if the public are aware what progress in
psychical research has been m ade in this country during the
past few years. I am quite certain they are not. T h e 'm a n in the
street’ muddles psychical research with spiritualism, with which
it has little in com m on— except that 'survival’ m ay perhaps one
day be proved by the scientists. A nd many people believe that
psychical research is anathema to orthodox Science. They are
wrong, and this is a fitting opportunity to put on record what
academ ic recognition has been accorded to scientific psychical
research in this country during the past twenty yeaxs, and what
progress has been made. It can be stated briefly, and I will
A C A D E M I C R E C O G N I T I O N 335
begin with the founding o f the six-roomed National Laboratory
o f Psychical Research, which I opened at South Kensington in
1925. This was the w orld’s first fully equipped laboratory1 for
the scientific exam ination o f alleged paranormal phenomena,
and the beginning o f sustained scientific and active experimenta­
tion in Great Britain.
1925. Price founds the National Laboratory of Psychical Research in
London, and becomes its Director. Many famous mediums tested.
1934. Price makes formal offer2 to University of London to equip
and establish a Department of Psychical Research. After due
consideration offer is accepted in principle, and Price is informed
officially that the Senate accepts psychical research as ca fit
subject of University study and research.9 But room cannot be
found for the proposed new Department, so the project is shelved.
1934. In order to keep contact with the University authorities, the
National Laboratory is transferred to a group of professors and
' others, under the tide of the University of London Council for
Psychical Investigation, with Price as Honorary Secretary.
1936. London University accepts Price’s library of psychic litera­
ture on permanent loan, and houses the laboratory and equip­
ment of the old National Laboratory of Psychical Research.
1937. The German Government, through Bonn University, inform
Price that they are willing to accept psychical research as an
eofficial science,9 and invite him to Germany. This is the first
time that the Government of any country has officially recognized
psychical research.
1937. The German Government and the University of Bonn offer
Price academic and other honours if he will found a Department
of Parapsychology (psychical research) at Bonn.
1939. J. Hettinger granted the Ph.D. degree (London) for a thesis
on mental phenomena.
1940. Trinity College, Cambridge, accepts the Perrott Bequest and
establishes a Studentship in Psychical Research.
1941. New College, Oxford, accepts the Blennerhasset Trust for the
promotion o f Psychical Research.
1943. L. J. Bendit received the M .D. degree (Cambridge) for a
thesis on mental phenomena.
1944. V . G. Kirk Duncan received the D.Phil. degree (Oxford) for
a thesis on mental phenomena.
1 A full description of the Laboratory, with photographs, can be found in the
British Journal of Psychical Research,, May-June 1926, pp. i:MO.
2Full details of the proposal can be found ip my Searchfor Truth, pp. 97-no.

1945. S. G. Soal received the D.Sc. degree (London) for work in
It will com e as a surprise to most readers"that official Science
has recognized psychical research to such an extent. It will be
noted that in this country the recognition has been for work in
mental phenomena only (telepathy, psychopathology, etc.). No
one in this country has received honours (such as were offered
to m e by B onn) for work done in physical phenom ena. It hap­
pens that I am m ore interested in that facet o f the subject. So,
whatever the scoffers say, the science o f psychical research is
establishing itself. A nd a. good deal has been done in this
direction since I founded the first psychic laboratory in 1925.1
The num ber o f workers in this field is few, but they are being
rewarded. Speaking o f ‘ rewards,’ I often wonder what would
have happened to m e had I gone to Bonn in 1937 at the invita­
tion o f the Germ an Governm ent.
W ill Science ever discover another ‘ B orley’ ? I sincerely hope
so, and I trust it will not neglect to take full advantage o f its
possibilities to further our knowledge o f those unknown and
uncontrolled forces so well illustrated in the R ectory phenomena.
I f the scientists cannot explain them I hope they will continue
their investigations until they do. There must be an explanation
— probably some new spiritual or physical pow er beyond our
present knowledge, just as radio and the splitting o f the atom and
a hundred other things were beyond the knowledge o f our im­
mediate ancestors.
W hy are there so few good cases o f hauntings? There have
been so m any murders, massacres, wars, revolutions, conflagra­
tions, plagues, Germ an extermination camps, and calamities
without end. Millions o f people die; millions have died violent
deaths; and one would im agine that thousands o f buildings—or
the sites on which they stood— w ould have retained some psychic
echo, emanation, or persisting remnant o f their tragic past. The
very vastness o f our planet, with its m yriad events in which so
1 Mr Price was described by The Times Literary Supplement (Dec. 26, 1942) as
having |
done more than anyone of his generation to establish psychical research oa
a scientific basis.’— P u b l i s h e r .
T H E E N D OF T H E S T O R Y 3 3 7
many hum an lives have been lost by human violence, should,
one w ould think, guarantee us many 'gh osts/ But such is not
the case. W h y? W hy do we get so few genuine hauntings?
Another problem for Science!
W ell, I have com e to the end o f m y story and the end o f
sixteen years5 continuous work on the Borley problems. I
believe we now know all that can be learned about the case.
Some day I should like to visit Le Havre and study its conventual
records in an effort to find out more about 'M a ry Lairre5
— if
she ever existed. I f successful in m y quest, I might be tem pted
to write up her history— which probably was quite unexciting
until she crossed the Channel. In the meantime I present to the
reader all the new evidence we possess for the haunting o f the
Rectory. I f he has derived half the pleasure out o f reading this
evidence as I did out o f collecting it, then I shall be more than
satisfied.
