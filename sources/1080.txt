COUNCIL MEETING.
At a Council Meeting held on the 6th of March, the follo\\'ing
Members were present :-Messrs. Alexander Calder, Walter H. Coffin,
Edmund Gurney, Chas. C. Massey, Edward R. Pease, and Frank
Podmore. Mr. Calder was eleeted to take the chair.
The minutes of the previous Meeting were read, and with a slight
alteration signed as correct.
On the proposition of the Chairman, seconded by Mr. Gurney,
Professor H. Sidgwick was elected a Vice-President, and a Member' of
the Council, in accordance with Rule 18.
Five new Members and eight new Associates were elected, whose
names and addresses appear on another page.
A letter was read from Major G. Rowan Hamilton, a Member of
the Society, expressing his wish to resign, mainly on account of being
so much abroad.
It was agreed that Mrs. Wingfield·should, at her request, be elected
as a Member instead of as an Associate.
Information was received of the death of Mrs. Jennings, wh()
joined the Society last year as a "Library Associate."
Presents to the library were on the table from-Mr. E. Heron-Allen,
Mr. H. A. Kersey, Mr. John Moule, Members of the Society; from the
Phasmatological Society of Oxford; ar.d from Dr. Monckton, of
Maidstone. The books are specially acknowledged in the Supplementary
Catalogue on another page. The thanks of the Council were directed to
be given to the donors. ,
Mr. Gurney reported th'lt he and Professor Ba.rrett had been per-
mitted by Mr. Husk to examine the iron ring on his wrist. They
found that five fingers could be inserted between the ring and the
wrist. Their opinion ,vasi that, though the ring in its present shape

could certainly not be drawn off without considerable violence, if at all,
yet, if it were hammered or forced into a more convenient form, the
insertion or withdrawal of the hand might be possible. The question
on which Professor Barrett and Mr.' Gurney had to report was
restricted to this one point-how far the mere fact that the ring, when
they saw it, was round the wrist, could be regarded as a conclusive
test of its having got there by some unknown agency. They considered
.that in itself the test was not conclusive.
Subject to a suggested alteration of one phrase, a new edition of
the" Objects" was agreed to, embodying a statement of the new
arrangements with regard to the research work of the Society.
The Finance Committee presented a report, accompanied by an
estimate of receipts and expenditure to the end of the year. The
following is a summary of its principal points:-
The Committee reported that they had met and had examined the
financial affairs of the Society. After making what they considered a
reasonable estimate of the number of llew Members and Associates who
might be expected to join the Society during the remaining months of
1885, the unappropriated income of the Society, including the balance
now in hand, might be set down at £868, without calculating on the
receipt of any important donations.
Keeping efficiency in view, they submitted a proposed distribution
of this sum, which included the items of rent, general meetings, salary,
and necessary current expenses on the scale of last year, the issue of
two more Parts of Proceedings, and the monthly journal, leaving only a
comparatively small amount available for experimental work. This
result, however, is attained only by the inclusion of an offer on the
part of Professor Sidgwick to defray in the first instance, certain
items of expenditure connected with the work of the Literary Com-
mittee, to be repaid by the Society in the event of there being a
sufficient surplus at the end of the year.
The report of the Committee also states: "It will be observed
that no allowance is made in the estimate for lectures, nor for library
purchases. . . Should donations be received provision can be made
for these items."
The usual monthly cash account was presented, and various accounts
passed for payment.
On the application of Mr. Edmund Gurney, a grant not exceeding
.£10 was authorised to a Committee for Mesmeric Investigation.
It was agreed that a General Meeting should be held in the month
of April, at the Rooms of the Society of British Artists, Suffolk-street,
Pall Mall, the chair to be taken at 8.30 p.m., and that the Council
should meet on the afternoon of the same day.

CASES RECEIVED BY THE LITERARY COMMITTEE.
In our January number notice was given of the intention of the
Literary Committee to publish in the Journal a selection of the reports
of phenomena. which they from time to time receive. The following
narratives, collected by Mr. Podmore, are obviously of very unequal
evidential value; but even those which, from this point of view, are most
defective, have one or more features of interest for the investigator.
The numbers attached to the different narratives are for the
convenience of members of the Literary Committee. The letter L that
stands before each number indicates that these narratives belong to
that part of the collection which is distinguished by the Committee as
relating to " Phantasms of the Li",-ing. " It will be remembered that
the Committee include under this term apparitions or dreams occurring
at or about the time of the death of the persons whom they represent.
The letters that follow the numberrefer to the classification of these
" Phantasms" adopted by the Committee as the most convenient. They
indicate that the state of the Agent (A) and of the Percipient (P) is
either 'lW'rlnal (n), dying (d), Bleep (8), or some peculiar excitement (e).
We shall welcome any communication tending to throw further light
on any of these narratives.

From Miss Deering, Louisville, Kentucky.
I very distinctly remember that one day, a few years ago, my
father lay down for a few minutes, as at that time usual before going to
his office in the afternoon. Seated on a stool beside him, and with my
left hand enfolded in one of his, I read the book in which I was at the
time interested, for Dve or possibly seven minutes. At the end of that
time he turned his face toward me, and seeing that the room was
shaded, remarked: "Anna. you will injure your eyes reading in this
dim light." " And I do not particularly like this book," I responded.
I held in my hand a historical novel, the name of which I am sorry I
cannot recollect, but I remember vividly that the passage I had just
read purported to be one of the last scenes in the life of Marie Antoi-
nette, and I remember as distinctly that in that scene a tall man carried
a coffin from a room in which Marie Antoinette and some attendant
ladies were at the time standing. I remember that in the story that
tall man stood prominently in the foreground, and that my mind was
strained under the part he took in that scene almost to the verge of
repugnance.
In reply to my father's question why I did not like the book, I
replied in tlubstance as in the foregoing, and he immediately told me

March,l885.] JOle,.fJall!f Societ!l.fol' PS!icflical Research. 293
that he had just seen what I had described, and had opened his eyes
and turned his face toward me to dissipate the scene, which for the
moment he had looked upon as an isolated phantasm.
ANNA M. DEERING.
Louisville, Kentucky, U.S., October 18tl~, 1884.
From Mr. Deering.
While I lay with my daughter's hand in mine, as she relates in the
accompanying memoir, I fell into the semi-slumber usual with me on
lying down to rest for a few minutes after my luncheon, early in the
afternoon. At these times I very seldom fall asleep, but simply into a
species of slumber, in which I frequently find myself in a kind of
rayless or moonless moonlight, looking, and this usually with serene
pleasure, at near-by gardens, slopes, rivulets, and various little vistas,
which more times than otherwise vanish at my bidding, and, except I
fall asleep, are immediately replaced by others. Sometimes these are
peopled with apparently living figures, and frequently these also dissolve
at my bidding, and are replaced by others. There is, however, this
difference, any control I exercise for the purpose of a change seems to
be more immediate and more absolute over a change of figures than over
a change of scenes.
I am quite sure that at these times I do not fall into any condition
that fairly can be called pathological.
·Under the slumber now under consideration, my attention became
fixed on a tall thin man, with head uncovered, beardless, and dressed in
black. He came toward the foot of the bed on which I lay from the
left; and perhaps I should note that my daughter sat upon my left.
Immediately I saw several other figures; and though these stood out·
side the lines or field of my direct vision, I remember distinctly that
they made on me an impression of sympathy with powerlessness. I
might think that the sympathy touched ma through the countenance
()f the man, were it not that he impressed me with also the opposite of
powerlessness. His age seemed to be about 50, his face oblong, a little
sallow, seriously thoughtiul, and withal indicative of great but quiet
firmness in action, whether from a sense of duty based on his own
judgment, or duty under a sense of obedience, I cannot determine,
though in the absence of allY appearance of the vindictive, I think, or
at least am inclined to think, that alike his presence and his action were
based on simply an obedience to some rightful authority. This action
was a reverent stepping forward, and a silent laying of his hands on a
coffin that seemed to rest across the foot of the bed. The moment I
8&W the coffin I thought: I do not like this scene; please go away anll
let something more agreeable come in. But the scene would not
change, and again I thought: Please go away and let something more

.294 Journal of Sodel!1 for Psychical Re8earch. [March, 1885.
agreeable come in ; and again the scene would nOG change. He raised
the coffin, it seemed as easily as though it had been that of an infant,
and was in the act of stepping backward, as though withdrawing from
a presence, when I thought: Then I will not prolong this slumber; I will
open my eyes and arouse myself. And, on immediately doing so, I spoke
to my daughter as she narrates, and then without anything like amaze-
ment, listened to her description from the book.
I have been minute, as in the foregoiI!g, because I wish to put
every feature of and every impression given me by the scene carefully
on record, against a search which I purpose to keep up for the book out
of which my daughter at the time sat reading. She did not then or
ever read to me what she had read, but simply and in her own language
drew the scene; and this in, perhaps, as few words as she has now
written it, nor have we since that time in any particular way conversed
about it. My impression is that the book she ~d was an octavo in
paper covers, but its name or author, or whose it was or what became
ofit, neither of us can recollect; nor do either of us at this time remem-
ber any of the scenes immediately preceding or attending the tragic
death of Marie Antoinette as these are, or may be, recorded in history.

The article appearing on the other side is true in every particular.
The gentleman, a resident of this city, a man of high nervous organisa.-
tion, was born in Belfast, U.S.A. Between himself and his daughter
exists a degree of attachment rarely seen in such kinship. I related
the incident as he gave it to me.

[We have not as yet come across any historical novel containing the
incident referred to, and we can find no trace of it in any history or
memoir of Marie Antoinette.-F. P.]
Note.-Itis obvious that thevalue of this narrative, as affording evidence of
Thought-transference, must be proportional to the degree of exactness with
which the correspondence between the dream and the description in the
book can be made out. It might, therefore, be considerably increased if the
book could be discovered. Even as it stands the coin(lidence is certainly
remarkable; but as Miss Deering's description preceded her father's account
of his vision, it is possible that its similarity to the description became
unconsciously somewhat stronger in recollection than it was in reality.

From Mr. F. Teesdale Reed, Longfieet, Poole.
I had an uncle who, after spending thirty-three years on board ship,
left the sea, got marrioo, and settled down near London. His only
son and myself were constant playmates, and for a short time school-
fellows also. My cousin's one great wish was to go to sea, but this, so
far from being encouraged, always provoked a stem rebuke, if even the
topic only was mentioned. At last Cousin Jack seemed to have got
over his yearning for the naval service; he quietly bore with a good
grace what to him was a bitter disappointment. As he was now a. big
lad it was necessary to find him something to do. A post was found for
him under my father in a house of business iR the City. Here he
did well, and soon won golden opinions from all about him. One day-
it was Lord Mayor's Day, and the City was too excited to settle down
to sober business-Jack asked my father for half a day's holiday and
an advance of five shillings. The holidaywas granted a.nd he-was told
he could take the money and enter it in the proper hook. After that
he went, as was thought, for a feW hours' pleasure. He never returned.
Inquiries were made at every likely place, but to no purpose. His
parents were utterly disconsolate at his disappearance. We all guessed
that he had gone off to sea, but none dared give utterance in the
father's presence to the thought, knowing how unwelcome such an
explanation would be. Months passed by and no news came. At
length-perhaps it was twelve or eighteen months afterwards-my
thoughts were again directed to my missing cousin. It was in this
way. One Sunday morning my father invited me to go with him to
see my uncle and aunt. On the road he told me that during the night
he had had a most remarkable dream, and he wished to test it as far as
he could, for he was strongly pl·rsuaded that it would be fulfilled. At .
the same time he urged me to notice the date and preserve in my
memory the details as far as possible. I may just say, in parenthesis,
that we continued our journey, paid the visit, but found that nothing
had been heard of my cousin. The dream, so far as I can recollect it
at this distance of time, was somewhat as follows: The scene is in
a foreign port (guessed at the time to be Spanish). On board a British
man-of-war that is anchored there a young man (my cousin Jack) is
giving instructions to some men at work in the rigging. He is ap-
parently dissatisfied with what they are doing, for he hurries up, makes
some slight alteration, and then descends. A rung of the rope ladder
gives way as his foot touches it, he falls backward, head first, and dies
instantly. The surgeon hurries to the spot, examines the body, but
leaves it as he can do nothing there. Then arrangements are made for
the burial. The coffin is taken on shore, some of the officers and men·
accompany it, and it is solemnly lowered into thepve. There·

the dream ended. Some time after my father (he had already ascer·
tained the time it would take' for a letter to come from the Spanish
coast to England) asked me one morning if I still remembered his
strange drea:n. He then made me repeat it to him. After that he
said: " Well, if there is anything in it, your uncle will have heard
60mething about it by this time, let us go and see him." When we
reached the house we could see at a glance that something had hap-
pened. My father at once asked if there was any news yet of Jack.
Yes, that morning's post had brought a large envelope bearing the
Lisbon post-mark. It was written by one of the officers of a man-
of-war that was then anchored at Lisbon, and its purpose "!Vas to
make known the death of my cousin. After a very kind and favour-
able notice of Jack's general conduct and abilities, it gave full details
of his death and burial. Those details tallied exactly with the details
given in my father's dream, and it occurred the very date of the
dream. I was perfect.ly amazed. I inspected the letter and could not
see any point in which there was the slightest contradiction or even
divergence. Of course my uncle was then informed of the dream,
and I feel sure the talk we then had about the matter helped my uncle
to bear his bitter trial with more serenity than he would have done if
we had not been there with our visions from dreamland.

LongHeet, Poole, 28t'~ October, 1884.
T can quite understand your desire to verify, as far as possible,
every statement made, but unfortunately I shall not be able to furnish
much corroboration. I have just a little; what there is I will place
before you. I found the inclosed "inspector's certificate." I see it
corrects my story in one point, and confirms it in another. I said that
the event happened about thirty-two years ago; this document is dated
1847, i.e., thirty-seven years ago. At the time of writing the paper I
did not sufficiently think over the question of time. I would add that
the family consisted of my uncle, aunt-who are both dead-my cousin
John (of whom I have written), and his sister, who is still alive in
Australia. She may be able to furnish more particulars. Her address
I will procUf8 and forward to you in a few days' time. However weak
:it may be in collateral evidence, I am positive as to the fact of the
dream, and that I ha,·e fairly represented it in its essential points.-
Yours truly, F. T. REED.
The inspector's certificate shows that John Tabner, seaman, died at
sea on board H.M.S.Canopin on the 24th of April, 1847.
Note.-We have here, in the absence of an independent account of the
death given in any detail, and of written notesofthe dream, to rely almost en·
tirely on Mr. Reed'. recollection as regards the degree of correspondence

between the two. Considering the lengthofthe time since the eventoccurred,
this is, of course, natural. It will, however, greatly add to the evidential
value of the narrative should we succeed in obtaining from Mr. Tabner's
sister an accOunt of her recollection of tlle circumstances, corroborating aud
supplementing Mr. Reed's.

From Mr. Wm. Garli~k, F.R.C.S., of 33, Great JAmes Street, Blooms-
bury, W.C. (Known to F. P)
In the early morning of August 29th, 1832, when lying in bed half
asleep and half awake, I was suddenly startled by perceiving the form
of my brother George, then absent from home, standing beside ma-
The room was quite light, and my recognition of the figure was complete
and clear. He looked at me, and then seemed to fade slowly away.
My brother (who had a speciaJ. warm affection for me) was at that time
a. sailor on board the merchant ship" Eliza," bound for the East Inilles.
I had no reason to suppose anything was wrong with him, nor was he
specially in my thoughts. The vision, for I felt certain that I was
awake and not dreaming, made a very strong and painful impression
upon me, so milch so that the family where I was staying asked the
cause of my troubled looks. I told them what I had seen, and at my
hostess's *request made a note of the occllrrence. Months afterwards
we received the intelligence that my brother had died at Baroda, near
Sumatra, of dysentery. The d!l.te and hour of his death (as nearly as
could be calculated) coincided exactly with that of his appearance to me
at Stroud (Gloucester). I am of a calm and unimaginative tempera.-
ment, and have never had any similar experience before or since. The
ooincidence was well·known to various members of my family, but I do
not now remember that I mentioned the matter to anyone else at the
time. WM. GARLICK.
From Mrs. Garlick.
I was present at the breakfast table on the 29th August, 1832.
when my mother, Mrs. Humpage, questioned Mr. Garlick on the cause
of his unusual gloom and quietness. He then told us that he had seen
his brother-who was at that time at sea-in his bedroom an hour or
two before. My mother remarked, " You will be sure tohear something.
so note the date."
Some months afterwards I remember that 0. letter came for Mr.
Garlick, forwarded from his mother, announcing the death of this brother
on that day, the 29th August. I heard of this, of course, as soon as the
letter was received. L. GARLICK.

At a personal interview, Mr. Garlick explained that the figure
..amainedin his sight, apparently, about ten minutes. He has a very
'vivid recollection of the fea.tures, but cannot recall the dress. He infers
from this that the dress was that which his brother usually wore, as he
would certainly have noticed and remembered any unusual detail in
the costume.
He was about 18years old at the time.
The" note" referred to was a mental note only,but he is confident of
the a.ccuracy of his memory.
The precise hour of his brother's death was only a matter of
inference. Mr. Garlick showed me the entry of the death, with the
date, in his family Bible.
Mrs. Garlick's confirmation is given above; no other is obtainable.
Mr. Garlick has never experienced any other hallucination, veridical
or otherwise.-F. P.
Novemher 18tA, 1884.
Note.-The long interval-52 years-between the date of this experience
and the date of its record, and the irremovable uncertainty as to the coinci-
dence in time between the vision and the corresponding death, are obvious
defects from an evidential point of Vlew; still, this and similar narratives
are of value as confirming a generalisation based mainly on more recent
and more precise evidence. The same remark applies to No. 1055.

[Mr. Falkinburg's mother is dead. I have written to his brother to
ask for his account of the circumstances.-F. P.]
Your favour of August 29th at hand and contents noted, and,
in reply, will give you, to the best of my recollection, a full history of
the circumstance.
The circumstance of which the ])ream Investigator speaks was this,
and let me assure you it is impressed upon my mind in a manner which
will preclude its ever being forgotten by me or the members of my family
interested. My little son, Arthur, who was then five years old, and
the pet of his grandpa, was playing on the floor when I enter-ed the
house a quarter of 7 o'clock, Friday evening, July 11th, 1879. I was
very tired, having been receiving and paying for s'taves all day, and it
being an exceedingly sultry evening I laid down by Artie on the carpet.
and entered into conversation with my wife (not, however, in regard
to my parents). Artie, as usually was the case, came and laid down
with his little head upon my left arm, when all at once he exclaimed,

" Papa! papa! Grandpa!" I cast my eyes toward the ceiling, or
opened my eyes, I am not sure which, when, between me and the joists
(it was an old-fashioned log cabin), I saw the face of my father as
plainly as ever I saw him in my life. He appeared to me to be very
pale, and looked sad, as I had seen him upon my last visit to him three
months previous. I immediately spoke to my wife, who was sitting
within a few feet of me, and said, "Clara, there is something wrong
at home; father is either dead or very sick." She tried to
persuade me that it was my imagination, but I could not help
feeling that something was wrong. Being very tired we
soon after retired, and about .10 o'clock Artie woke me up
repeating, "Papa, grandpa is here." I looked, and believe, if I
remember right, got up, at any rate to get the child warm, as he com-
plained of coldness, and it was very sultry weather. Next morning I
expressed my determination to go at once to Indianapolis. My
wife made light of it and over-persuaded me, and I did not go until
Monday morning, and upon arriving at home (my father's) I found him
buried the day before (Sunday, July 13th). Now comes the mysterious
part to me. After I had told my mother and brother of my vision,
or whatever it may have been, they told me the following :-
On the morning of the 11th July (the day of his death) he arose
early, and expressed himself as feeling unusually well, and ate a
hearty breakfast. Soon after leaving the table he said he believed
he would "clean up and put on a: clean. shirt, as he felt some one was
coming to see him that day." He washed, went upstairs alld put on Ilia
best clothes, and came down and told mother he would go in to the
parlour and read, and if anyone called to see him notify him.
He took the Bible (he was a Methodist minister) and went and
remained until near noon. He ate a hearty diuner and went to the front.
gate, and, looking up and down the street, remarked that he could not, or
at least would not be disappointed, some one was surely coming. During
the afternoon and evening he seemed restless, and went to the gate, look-
ing down street,frequently. At last, about time for supper, he mentioned
my name, and expressed his conviction that God, in his own good time,
would answer his prayers in my behalf (I being at that time very wild).
Mother going into the kitchen to prepare supper, he followed her and
continued talking to her about myself and family, and especially Arthur
(my son). Supper being over, he moved his chair near the door, and was
conversing about me at the time he died. The last words were about
me, and were spoken, by mother's clock, 14 minutes of 7. He did not
fall, but just quit talking and was dead.
Then mother's dream of the extraordinary large coffin came to her
memory. She toldme that she.wasgoing somewhere andsawthe coffin, and
asked myself and brother, Who was dead 1wpo that large coffin was for ~

My brother replied it was for father. This so impressed her mind that
it was a source of much discomfort to her. " To think," she said," that
I was warned so plainly, and yet did not have the least idea. of his
nearness to death."
Now what was so mysterious to me was the anticipated visit or
arrival of someone on that particular day, as though he was impressed
with the idea that someone would come.
In answer to my inquiries, my son Arthur says he remembers the
circumstances, and the impression he received upon that occasion is
ineffaceable. SAMUEL S FALKINBURG.
Box 142, Uniontown, Union Co., Ky., U.S.A.
The account in the Dream Investigator states that "when he (Arthur)
awoke he told me grandpa had been there, and that he (my father) told
him tha.t he was very cold, and that he was frozen stiff."
I drew Mr. Falkinburg's attention to this discrepancy, and received
the following reply :-
1st. (In answer to "hallucination" questions.) I do not remember
eyer having any experience of that kind before this happened, but I
have frequently since. My little boy does not know, and it is difficult

dreams. .
2nd. My mother's dream occurred the night preceding my father's
death.
3rd. My understanding at the time of the occurrence was that it
was my father that was cold and complained of being frozen, and no!;
the boy, as it was in July, and extremely sultry.
Many times since then I have imagined I llBve heard my father
0\11 me, and have looked for him almost expecting to see him. So my
son says he has also.
My dreams are very generally of, and with him, and there is hardly
a night passes but he and I are together in some way. I will write
you one of my dreams in full in a few days. .

From Mrs. Falkinburg, Uniontown.
September 12tlt, 188(.
Mr. Frank Podmore.
SIR,-In answer to your request, 1 will say that I cheerfully give
my recollection of the circumstance to which you refer.
We were living in Brown County, Indiana, 50 miles south of
Indianapolis, ill the summer of 1879. My husband (Mr. S. S.
Falkinburg) was in the employ of one John Ayers, buying staves.
On thp, evening of July llth, about 6.30 o'clock, he came into the
March,l885.] Journal qf 8ociet!1 .for P8!lcllical Research. 301
room where I was sitting and laid down on the carpet with my little
boy Arthur, complaining of being very tired and warm.
Entering into conversation on some unimportant matter, _~rthur
went to him and laid down by his side.
In a few moments my :qotice was attracted by hearing Arthur
exclaim:- "Oh. papa, grandpa, grandpa, papa," at the same time
pointing with his little hand toward the ceiling.
I looked in the direction he was pointing, but saw nothing.
My husband, however, said: "Clara, there is something wrong at
home; father is either dead or very sick." I tried to laugh him out of
what I thought an idle fancy, but he insisted that he saw the face of
his father looking at him from near the ceiling, and Arthur said,
"Grandpa was come, for he saw him." That night we were awakened
by Artie again calling his pa to see grandpa. Well, my husband
has given you a detailed account, except that a short time after lie
started, Monday, to go to Indianapolis, I received a letter calling him
to the burial of his father; and some time after, in conversation with
his mother, it transpired that the time he and Artie ~w the vision
was within two or three minutes of the time his father died.
This, with my husband's, is about a., near as I can call to
recollection.
Hoping this may be what you requested, I remain, respectfully,
MRS. CLARA T. FALKINBURG.
Note.-The subsequent hallucinations of both percipients-if more than
mere illusions-are a.n important fea.ture in the above narrative, however
they are to be expla.ined. We may infer from them that both Mr. Falkin-
burg and his son have a certain predisposition to hallucination; hence perhaps
somewhat less weight is to be attached to the fact that Mr. Falkinburg docs
not recollect having had any similar experience before the one described. In
any case the transfer or suggestion of the phantasm from the son to the
father is a phenomenon psychologically interesting.

From Capta.in P. (Known to F. P.)
Some time at the enel of 1868 I was discussing with a lady of J?lY
acquaintance the question of making compacts to appear after death. I
doubted whether such compacts could be fulfilled; she stoutly main-
tained that they could be. Finally we agreed to make such a compact
ourselves-that whichever of us first died should appear after death to
the other. At the beginning of the next year I went on a voyage in
tbe merchant ship, Edmund Graham, of Greenock, to Australia, and, on
the 22nd of June, when we were between the Cape of Good Hope and
Australia (lat. 40deg. S., long. 22 E.), and the ship running before a
heavy gale of wind, the sea swept over the deck and washed seven of

us, myself among the number, overboard. I gave myself up for lost,
and I remember well that I thought of the panorama of their past lives
which drowning men are said to see, and hoped that the show would
(lommence. Then I regretted I was without my oilskin, as the water
would have time to wet me through before death, and I expected to
find it very cold; as far as I can recollect, this was all that passed
through my mind. The next moment I caught hold of a loose rope that
was hanging from the ship, and hauled myself on deck. The others
were drowned. This took place between 3 and 4 a.m. on June 22nd. A
few months afterwards I had a letter at Bombay, from my friend, in
which she mentioned that on the night of the 22nd June she had seen
me in her room.
When I saw her again, I received from her 0. full account of the
circumstance. She told me that she woke up suddenly in tho night,
and saw me at the other end of the room, and that I advanced towards
her. Whether she noticed the dress which I was wearing I cannot
say. I have often since heard her describe the incident. As far as I can
recollect, she told me the precise time of the appearance; and my belief
is that it coincided in time with my being washed overboard. Though
I cannot recollect ca.lculating the difference of time, by reference to the
longitude, I think it ml)st likely that I did so and found the times to
(lo1.Tespond. I was certainly, at that time, quite alive to the fact that
22deg. of longitude would make 0. sensible difference in the apparent
time. . M. P.
The following is 0. portion of 0. letter from the percipient to
Captain P. :-
I enclose the papers you gave me to look a.t the other night, and in
looking over the printed notes of the Society I see (as a Catholic) I can
have nothing to do with it.
You can tell your friend the reason I decline saying anything about
it is because I am a Papist, and that I consider those sort of things
much too sacred to make the topic of conversation at any modern
scientific meeting.
Note.-We have here a fair specimen of the large and varied class of
obstacles which the present state of thought and feeling on the subject of
apparitions places in the way of our im·estigation.

Fl'Om General H. (Through Miss Leith.)
In 1856 I was engaged 011 duty at a place called Roha, so~e 40
miles south of Bombay, and moving about in the districts (as it is

termed in India). My only shelter was a tent, in which I lived for
several months in the year. My parents, and only sister, about 22
years of age, were living at K., from which place letters used to take a
week reaching me. My sister and I were regular correspondents, and
the post generally arrived about 6 a.m., as I was starting to my work.
It was on the 18th April of that year (a day never to be forgotten) that
I received a letter from my mother, stating that my sister was not feel-
ing well, but hoped to write to me the next day. There was nothing in
the letter to make me feel particularly anxious. After my usual out-
door work, I returned to my tent, and in due course set to my ordinary
daily work. At 2 o'clock my clerk was with me, reading some
native documents that required my attention, and I was in no way
thinking of my sister, when all of a sudden I was startled by seeing my
sister (as it appeared) walk in front of me from one door of the tent to
the other, dressed in her night-dress. The apparition had such an effect
upon me that I felt persuaded that my sister had died at that time. I
wrote at once to my father, stating what I had seen, and in due time I
also heard from him that my sister had died at that time. .
NovernlJer 11th, 1884. J. C. H.
In answer to further inquiries, General H. writes :-
By the context of the narrative you will see it was 2 p.m., broad
daylight. My vision corresponded with the exact time of death.
I have never seen any other apparition.
You must excuse my sanctioning my name being appended to the
account, though I am as certain of it as I am of my own existence.
General H. further informs us that his parents are dead, and that
there is no friend living who may have seen his letter.

From the Rev. J. C. Learned, 1748, ·Waverley Place, St. Louis, Mo.
August 24th, 1884.
To Prof. 'Y. F. Barrett.
It was in 1863 that I took charge of the Unitarian Church in
Exeter, N.H. Five miles away, Rev. A. M. Bridge was preaching at
Hampton FaUs,-with whom I sometimes exchanged pulpits. After a
year or so he gave up the work in this little parish, and. somewhat later
entered upon an engagement in the town of East Marshfield, Mass., as
the railroad runs, nearly 80 miles from Exeter.
On Wednesday, December 13th, 1865, on waking in the morning, I
remarked to my wife upon the very vivid and singular dream which I
had had, and related it fully. I had seen Mr. 1}ridge taken suddenly

and violently ill. He seemed to be in 0. school-room. He sank down
helpless, but was borne away by friendly hands and laid upon a. couch
or lounge. I was by him, and assisted others in whatever way I could.
But he grew worse; even the open-air did not revive him; a. leaden
pallor soon spread over his features ; peculiar spots, which I had never
noticed before, like moles or discolourations of the skin, appeared upon.
his face, and after much suWering he died.
Immediately after breakfast, an4 while we were again speaking of
the dream, a ring at the door admitted to my house Mr. Wells Healey,
an cld parishioner of Mr. Bridge's, at Hampton Falls. I guessed the
nature o~ his message. He had come to ask me to attend the funeral
services of his former minister, who had suddenly died two days before
(Monday), at East Marshfield. Mr. Bridge's family had not removed
there, but he would be buried among the people he had so recently left.
I attendcd the funeral as requested. I learned from the family and
friends the particulars of his death, which coincided remarkably in
seyeral points with the dream a.lrea.dy repeated to my wife; and when
I looked at the face of the dead mall as he lay in his coffin, my atten-
tion was arrested and fixed by t"'8 peculiar spots uprm t"'8 fac8 to which
I have alluded, and which were stereotyped upon memory by ths dream.
SeptBmh8r 4t"', 1884.
l. I do not at present know the residence of any member of the
family of Rev. A. M. Bridge, nor do I know any persons in East
Marshfield who could give me particulars of his death; but the exact
date, with the circumstance of the dream, I obtained from my wife's
cliary.
2. I have often had vivid dreams, always quickly enough forgotten,
because nothing came of them. I have no doubt this would have
been forgotten but that something did come of it, and so was often
alluded to and retold afterward. Indeed, I don't know that any
other dream of mine ever had any other significance than to be
laughed at.
3. In the case cited, it would seem to mc th:;.t allY occult influence
affecting my train of thought must rather have reached me from the
living-the mother and children at Hampton Falls-than from the
dead father. 1\ly impression is that the body was sent to the family
on the day after his death, so that it was present with them on the
night when the dream occurred. Very likely the circumstances of his
illness and last moments had been detailed to them and others by
friends in attendance. I was very likcly to be thought of inconnection
with the burial, as I was 0. near neighbour, and often visited and
prcached in the little church.

From Mrs. Learned.
I distinctly recall the fact of the dream related by my husband,
80 BOon after verified in many particulars. I made it 0. point to record
it in my diary at the time, and we have often referred to that singular
experience since.

Note.-Tbe value of this narrative would of course be mAterially increased
if we could obtain independent evidence as to the circumstances of the death.
We should then ask Mrs. Learned to let us if poaaible have the exact
quotation from her diary, which would make the case a pretty complete one.
As it is, however, we think it has considerable interest.

From Mr. E. Stephenson, School House, Market Weighton Yorks.
NovemlJer 20th, 1884.
I a.m head-muter of the boys' school and organist of the parish at;
Weighton. My parents reside in Hull, my father being a cooper and
cask merchant there.
My mother's maiden name was Jane Cooling. Several years ago
(about 10 or 12) she told me a remarkable story which sank deeply
into my mind.
I got her to tell me the whole of her story again, a.nd it was
exactly the same as that she had told years before. I cross-questioned
her, but always got the sa.me answers.
My mother is 65 years of age. Her mind is quite clear a.nd her
memory very good. The affair happened when she was about 16 or
17 years old, and she maintains that even yet she ca.n see (in imagina-
tion) her brother as fairly as she saw him then.
The following is the story, which I have recently taken down.
carefully from her own lips. Having subjected my mother to some
very close questioning, I feel sure that you may depend upon the
statements being trustworthy.
Henry Cooling, the brother of Jane CooliDg, was a sailor, and had
gone on a long voyage.
Jane was living in Hull in the house of Mr. Kitching, Mytongate.
There was 8. large cupboard in the house, which was on a kind of
landing,_approached by two or three steps.
Just as she was about to go up to it, she saw distinctly, about I)
p.m., her brother Henry standing in front of the door. His eyes
were fixed on her for 8. short time, and then he disappeared towards
the left. He was dressed in his seaman's drawers and shirt. The
strings of his drawers were loose j his feet were bare j his hair was

untidy; and his whole appearance was like that of one roused suddenly
from sleep.
After the vision had vanished, u.s soon as she recovered herself, she
went home to her father and" told him what she had seen. He said it
was all nonsense, and told her to take no notice of it.
However, some days later, a letter came from the captain of the ship,
stating that Henry Cooling had been washed overboard during a gale in
the Bay of Biscay, just as he was ·called on deck to assist in working
the ship, Ilnd the time he gave us about the time of the accident
corresponded approximately to that at which Jane saw the vision.
" The above is the story purely as she told it to me, and she con-
fidently affirms that it is perfectly true in every detail.
Since the above was written, I have found the exact date of my
uncle's death-March 27th, 1836. My mother would, therefore, be 17
within a few days.
E. S.
In answer to inquiries, Mr. Stephenson writes :-
December 2nd, 1884.
I remember my mother telling us the story several years ago, while
her father was living in our house, and I have no recollection of any-
thing but his fullest assent to what she told. You will remember that
in my previous letter I stated that she told her father what she had
seen several days before they knew what had happened. He lived
with us many years, he knew we were informed of the affair, and
I never knew him contradict the story in any way. I could almost
swear that I have heard him affirm, but will not do so as I do not
exactly recollect the occasion, and do not wish to give you anything
but the purest evidence in such a matter.
My mother confidently affirms that she saw the vision at that hour,
5 p.m., and the letter from the captain of the vessel several days after-
wards confirmed her statement as to the time, and the being called from
his berth.
My mother has not, when completely awake, had any other
apparition or hallucination except the one furnished you.

From Mrs. W. (Through Miss A.:Leith.)
In 1874 I was in England ill in bed, and I distinctly saw my dear
mother, who was at that time at Nice, come up "to the foot of my bed;
and look earnestly and sorrowfully at me; it was broad" daylight, and
I noticed the shawl she wore, one I had not seen her wear for many

years. 1 started up and she was gone. I then knew that her last illness
must have come, though I was kept in igl10rance of it, as I was so
dangerously ill myself. I wrote to her, and her answer told me what I
dreaded was true. I was allowed to recover sufficiently to go out to
Nice, and be with her to the end. Also, I ought to say, that the morn-
ing her dear image appeared to me, a doctor arrived from London
whom she had sent to me by telegraphing to him from Nice, and this
doctor was the means of saving my life, as I was at thit time so ill that
.he said I could not have lived more than four hours longer.
C.M.W.
In a latter dated the 23rd January,1885, Miss ·W. writes in answer to
'Our inquiries, that her mother "does not know anything ahout the
~hawl forming part of my grandmother's dress at the time she saw the
.apparition." She adds that Mrs. W. has seen no other hallucinations,
.and that she had no reason to suspect her mother's illness at the time.
Miss W. writes: "I clearly remember, in 1874, my mother in her
.dangerous illness seeing my dear grandmother come up to the foot of
the bed. My mother has often told me since that her mother was
wearing a certain crimson shawl she was very fond of, that her
spectacles had dropped, and she looked over them at my mother, with
:sad inquiring eyes. My mother gazed at her for a minut-e, and then
cried out when the apparition vanished; and when the nurse came in,
having heard her cry, my mother insisted on being told the truth about
her mother, for she said she knew that she had come to ten her she was
dying, which was indeed the fact, though she lived long enough to
enable my mother to see her before she died." E. M. W.
Note.- The above narrative, taken in connection with the two that imme-
diately follow (No. 1058), constitute an example of a small, but espccially
interesting class among the cases collected by the Committee; which appear
to suggest that certain persons are peculiarly and constantly liable to
spontaneous telepathic impl'eSBions. In the case above given, however, it is
not quite clear how far the vision coincided with a sudden and marked change
in the state of the agent. Also it is poSBible that the doctor's visit, or the
expectation of it, may have called up her mother's image to Mrs. W.'s mind,
and that her illneSB may have rendered herspecially liable to hallucination. It
would remain noteworthy (unless there was special reason to fear the attack
d fatal illneSB) that the apparition produced a true conviction in Mrs. W.'a
mind as to what was occurring to her mother.

When I was in the South of France, in 1878, I had a dream that
a sister, who is especia.lly dear to me, was in a carriage accident, and
in my dream I saw her killed, but on reaching her I found her unhurt;

308 Jounlalo/ Society/or P8!lckical Re.t-aren. [Mazcb, 1885.
and as she smiled at me I dreamed I was dying of the agony of mind
I had gone through. I never can forget the dream, the suffering was
so intense. I awoke with pain in my heart and faintness, and wok&
my husband and told him. (I think my cries in my sleep awoke him.}
I wrote to my sister, and when her answer arrived she gave me in if;
the account of the danger she had passed through.
C.M. w.
B.
One night I was awakened out of my sound sleep by a voice cloS&
to my ear, saying, " Rise, you have no time to lose" ; and words to the
effect that the child of this very dear sister was dying, and that she
needed my prayers. I cannot remember the exact words, but I felt if;
wascouveyed to Iue that I had to help her with all the earnestness I
could, and there was an awe about it I cannot describe. Afterwa.rds
I found that at this very time on that night h~r most beloved child
had passed through the crisis in diphtheria.
Nothing of importance ever happened to anyone very dear to me
without my feeling it, though I may be far from them.
C.M.W.
On one occasion I received an anxious letter from my sister
inquiring if anything had happened to me, as she had dreamed of a.
serious carriage accident in which I wa.s in danger. This letter W8&
received by me before I had informed her of the danger in which I had
been placed, and the serious consequences which mercifully were
averted by the presence of mind of my coachman.
BESSIE S.
On another occasion my sister was awakened by a voice which said
distinctly, "Rise at once.' You have no time to lose. One you love
is in sore need." She did rise from her bed to pray for me, and after-
wards knew that my child had passed through the crisis of diphtheria.
at that very time, and that her life was in imminent danger.
BESSIB S.
I perfectly remember both these "prophetic" dreams of my mother's,
as she related them to me before receiving the answers to her letters
to my aunt.
E. M. W.
In a letter dated January 23rd, 1885, Miss W. writes in answer
to our questions :-
Mother is not in the habit of dreaming of accidents, and as far as
she can remember it was the only time she has ever dreamt of an
accident. The carriage did not upset. The facts are as follows :-My
aunt has a very light cab built by my uncle especially for her, and on
Digitized by Google
March, 1885.]' Journal of Society for P8ychical Re8earch,. 309
one occasion my aunt was driving along a narrow road, when her
(:oachman whipped up the horses, and began driving at a furious pace.
My aunt alarmed, looked through the little window at the baek of the
-carriage, and saw a great dray with a runaway horse tearing after the
Qrriage. Just as it must have run into it and smashed it the coach-
man turned the cab into an opening in the road. It was the only place
in the road where the cab could have stopped, and it was the coachman's
only hope to reach it, and the dray rushed by, leaving the cab un-
harmed. It did a great deal of damage, and the driver was killed.
You see mother did not dream exactly the facts of the case, but only
that my aunt wa.s nearly killed by a carriage accident.
As to the" other intimations of danger," &c., they are this, that
whenever anything happens to those dear to her she always knows
there is 80metlting happening. For instance, I was laid up with a very
bad cough and cold when away from her last year, and she wrote me an
anxious letter, saying, she knew I was ill, for she had an idea I had
inflammation of the lungs. Last month I was suffering dreadfully
from toothache and determined 1 would go and have two teeth out
without saying anything to mother for fear of worrying her; she
thought I was going for a walk, but all the time I was gone she was so
unhappy about me, and S. told me when I had come back that mother,
had cried and been wretched all the time. You see the things are not
big enough to attract much attention, but we in the house know them
to be true.
Note.-We have no evidence in the case of the dream of the carriage acci-
dent that it took place on the nightof the day on which the accident occurred,
and even if it did so, we should have to suppose either a deferred
impression or that Mrs. S. was in sleep repeating her experience of the
day. But probably no one who accepts the general fact of telepathic
communication will be disposed to conclude that the coincidence was a
merely accidental one. Mrs. W.'s impression, in the borderland between
sleeping and waking, of the danger to her sister's child, is, however,
more impressive, both because it was more than a dream, and because the
time coincidence seems in tIllS case to have been ascertained to be exact.
With regard to Mrs. W.'s less definite impressions whenever anything of
importance happens to anyone very dea.r to her, it is difficult (as Miss
W. suggests) to make them evidentially valuable without constant and
careful notes because of the double indefiniteness--the difficulty (1) of
deciding what is an event or experience of importance, and (2) of
distinguishing clearly a peculiar feeling that something is happening from
vague anxiety about absent friends. If Mrs. W. could continuously for
some little time make a note in writing, with as much detail as possible,
whenever a. feeling of this kind occurred, and a.fterwards add the
confirmation, much interesting light might be thrown on the subject.

CASE OF MONITION, SUCCEEDED BY CERTAIN
MESMERIO PHENOMENA.
Dr. Nicolas, Count de Gonemys, of Corfu, a member of the Society
for Psychical Research, hils kindly sent us 0. naI;mtive of personal ex-
perience of a very interesting kind. The narrative, which is in the
French language, is too long for insertion here, but the English abstract.
given below will place our readers in possession of its principal
features. We retain the first person in the narration for the sake of
cleanless.
In the year 1869 I was Officer of Health in the Hellenic army_
By command of the War Office I was attached to the garrison of the
Island of Zante. As I was approaching the island in a steamboat, to.
take up my new position, and at about two hours' distance from the
shore, I heard a sudden inward voice say to me over and over again
in Italian, "Go to Volterra." I was made almost dizzy by the
frequency with which this phrase was repeated. Although in perfectly
good health at the time I became seriously alarmed at what I con-
sidered as an auditory hallucination. I had no association with
the name of M. Volterra, a gentleman of Zante with whom I
was not even acquainted,although I had once seen him,ten years before.
I tried the effect of stopping my ears, and of trying to distract myself
by conversation with the bystanders; but all was useless, and I con-
tinued to hear the voice in the same way. At last we reached land; I
proceeded to the hotel and busied myself with my trunks, but the voice
continued to harass me. After a time a servant came and announced to
me that a gentleman was at the door who wished to speak with me at
once. "Who is the gentleman 1" I asked. "M. Volterra," was the
reply. And M. Volterra entered, weeping violently in uncontrollable
distress, and imploring me to follow him at once, and see his son, who.
was in a dangerous condition. I found a young man in a state of
maniacal frenzy, naked in an empty room, and despaired of by all the
doctors of Zante for the last five years. His aspect was hideous, and
rendered the more distressing by constantly-recurring. choreic spasms,.
accompanied by hissings, howlings, barkings, and other animal noises..
Sometimes he crawled on his belly like a serpent; sometimes he fell into.
a.n ecstatic condition on his knees; sometimes he talked and quarrelled
with imaginary interlocutors. The violent crises were often followed by
periods of profound syncope.
When I opened the door of his room he darted upon me furiously,
but I stood my ground and seized him by the arm, looking him fixedly
in the face. In a few moments his gaze fell; he trembled allover, and
fell on the floor with his eyes shut. I made mesmeric passes over him~
and in half an hour he had fallen into the somnambulic state.
Digitized by Google
March,I885.] Journal qf Society Jo,' P8ycMcai Researcl,. 311
The mesmeric cure· lasted two months and a half. During that
time many interesting phenomena were observed.
1. He became clairvoyant as to his own malady, foreseeing the
days and hours of his own attacks, and the nature of
each.
2. Sometimes I mesmerised him from my own house, without his
previously knowing of it.
3. In the somnambulic state he prescribed for himself; and .thO'
exhibition of the remedies prescribed (though these were
apparently insignificant) was f9110wed by an improvement in
his symptoms.
4. Once, when mthe mesmeric trance, he ordered me to let him
sleep for eight days continuously, without waking him, but
merely causing him to drink one glass of orange-water, and
placing in his mouth some morsels of gum. He did, in fact,
sleep for eight days, during which time no shouts or pinche!!
from allY one could awake him, although he replied at once
to questions which I addressed to him from an adjoining
room.
5. He used to discern me at a distance during his crises, and once,
at my request, he described with great accuracy my house
at Corfu.
The cure, however, was not uninterrupted., Often in the mesmeric
sleep he seemed to become a different person, expressed hatred for me,
spat at me, and tried to abstract himself from my influence. I con-
tended against these moods with all my might, and finally he would
become calm again and say "that it was not himself who had thus
acted." A month before his final cure he foresaw its date, but warned
me that I should have a severe conflict with him of all hour's dUration,
a.t a date which he announced before~and. After that struggle, if my
will prevailed, he would be completely restored to reason. At the
appointed hour I proceeded to mesmerise him, in his father's presence.
As soon as he fell under my influence he became wildly excited, called
me his assassin, implored his father with tears to turn me out of the
house, and gradually became more and more convulsed and haggard,
.with continual cries of "The doctor is killing me !" I continued to
mesmerise him, exerting the whole force of my will, and precisely at the
end of an hour the youth became unconscious, and fell on his mattres.~,
dragging me down with him in his fall. In 20 ~nutes more he awoke
into the mesmeric trance, and said, "Doctor, you havl'l saved me. I
am now perfectly cured. Let me sleep another hour and then wake
me; there is nothing more to fear." He awoke perfectly well, and has
had no return of his terrible malady.

Count Gonemys proceeds to discuss the nature of the purposeful
voice, or auditory monition, which warned him on the steamer of the
approaching need of his services. Count Gonemys inclines to the helief
that this call emanated from lOme third intelligence,-not from the
mind of the distressed father. .. Let us asaume," he says, ee that M.
Volterra in his despair at his son's condition had read in the newspaper
that an officer of health was expected at Zante, and had ardently wished
for the arrival of a new physician who might save the boy. Let us
further suppose that this strong wish had radiated from him on every
side, till it encountered the physician in question. Nevertheless, this
desire of his could not be formulated as an order, an admonition i-and
this order could not be given in the tl,ird per80n, e Go to Volterra.·
instead of 'Come to me.'"
Now here we shall be inclined to differ from Count Gonemys. In
our view, if 0. telepathic impact were communicated from M. Volterra.
to Count Gonemys, the veridical hallucination to which it gave rise
might.quite conceivably assume its definite shape in Count Gonemys'
brain, and represent itself to his consciousness, not as an appeal from a
suffering stranger, but as an order from some external power. The
impulse to the hallucination, in such cases, is given, as we argue, by
the agent, but the form of the hallucination is determined by the
special tendencies, or capacities, of the percipient'8 mind or brain. The
monitory turn of the sentence would, therefore, not prevent us from
classing it among our cases where the critical distress of one person
represents itself in the consciousness of another.
The absence of previous rapport between M. Volterra and Count
Gonem},s is a more serious difficulty. It is, however, a difficulty
which has met us in many other cases, (forming a class in our Pr0-
visional Index), where, nevertheless, we have thought that the hypotht'sis
of an extraneous intelligence need not at present be discussed. For we
have as yet so little conception of the mode in which the agent's mind
exercises its telepathic impulse that we cannot lay down any definite
line as to the percipients whom that impulse may affect.
We hope shortly to print a second communication received from
Count Gonl:mys. In the meantime, any Member or Associate desirous
of seeing the MS. of the above case, which contains a good deal of
theoretic discussion, may obtain it on loan by applying to the Assistant-
Secretary

REPORT ON A HAUNTED HOUSE AT NORWICH,
N01JemiJer 22nd, 1884.
In accordance with your instructions I have been to Norwich to
gather all the available evidence in connection with the "hauntings"
which you were informed occurred there. I called upon Mr. I. O. Howard
Taylor (an Associate of the Society for Psychical Research), who first
drew your attention to the matter, and ascertained from him the
address of the person who was inhabiting the house at the time the
disturbances were said to occur. He is a clerk, and we may call him
Mr. X. He gave his evidence clearly and very emphatically; he is an
exceedingly intelligent witness, but I consider him to be of a somewhat
nervous and excitable temperament, although, of course, his occasional
highly-strung manner may have been due to the nature of the circum-
stances which he was relating. His statements were to the following
effect:-
In September, 1883, he returned from his marriage trip and, with
his wife, took possession of a house in -- Road. He cannot say
how soon disturbances were noticed with extra interest, for it was
several months before the noises wbich were heard in the house were
recognised as of an unusual character. However, when Mr. and Mrs.
X. were in their bedroom at night, tramping souuds, like people occupy-
ing the sitting-room they bad just left, were beard, thp. handle of 0.
door at the foot of the stairs was once or twice unmistakably tried, and
sounds of footsteps mounting the stairs were heard. Instant investiga-
tion failed to discover a cause for these sounds, and their frequent
repetition led to the conclusion that the house was "haunted by a
haunt," to use }tIro X.'s own expression. The first unmistakable
proof, however, of the correctness of this. conclusion was presented to
him one night in the form of an apparition. He was in bed
with his wife in the spare bedroom - 0. window having
been broken in their own room. His wife was asleep;
he could not sleep, but was lying quite still, and wide
awake. Suddenly, on the first stroke of 12 from 0. clock in
the city, there was an audible "swish," and the figure of a man
stood before him, at the foot of the bed. The figure was that of a.
respectable old gentleman of about 60, with sharp, well-marked features.
He was dressed in a black coat and waistcoat, and stood quite motion-
less, staring intently at him. Mr. X., without the ability to do other-
wise, stared in return, until the last stroke of 12, when the apparition
appeared to raise its arms and sink through the floor. This experience
had a very marked effect upon his nerves, and during the fo~r months
which elapsed between that date and the time they were compelled. to
vacate the premises, he was continually apprehensive and nervous,
314 Jom'nlliof Societ!/ for Pa!lchicol Reaearcll. [March.181!G.
sometimes feeling utterly unable to go down from the dining-room to the
kitchen alone. This arose from a sense of fear. which he could not over-
come. even if by so doing he could have possessed himself of a hand-
some reward. He did not mention his experience to his wife,
nor to anyone j she, however, did not fail to observe his
changed behaviour and looks, and frequently remarked upon
the facts, as did also their friends and neighbours. The
noises still continued, and formed the subject of much speculation·
between them; the servant frequently heard footsteps walking up and
down the kitchen stairs, and at night they were frequently heard, .ery
distinctly and unmistakably,in different parts of the house. The servant,
too, says she sometimes heard subdued voices and other vocal sound~
but she seems hazy in separating these from those product>d by the
woman next door, who suffers from a chronic cough. But the one
manifestation which brought about their retreat from the house occurred
about 8.30 in the e.ening, in the lo.st week of September. 1884. Mrs..
X., the s~rvant, and a little girl who had been taking ~ with
them, "Were sitting in the back room of the two which form the groulld~
floor. They were chatting unconcernedly, and Mrs. X. was assisting
the little girl with some painting, standing with her back to the
window, which overlooks the yard. Suddenly, apparently from a vacant
chair which stood beneath the window, there came a loud tJigTt, which
was quickly followed by five more low. go.sping sighs, Il.S from a strong
man in great llOdily and mental anguish: then 0. pause of 0. few seconds,
followed by another sigh, much louder than the preceding ones, and
partaking more of the nature of 0. groan. The three hearers were
considerably frightened and upset: :lUrs. X. WIl.S seized with a violent
cramp ill her side, the little girl was fearfully ill, and the servant had
an attack of hysteria, and, as soon as they recovered the use of their
limbs, they lost no time in leaving the house. As they left the room,
and were entering the front one, which opens into the street, they heard
three (7 two) raps on the wall of the staircase as they,passed it. Mr.
X., meanwhile, was at his business: he returned home to find the
house locked up, and a neighbour explained to him what had occurred,
and told him where to find his wife. He found her, with the servant, at
the house of a friend. Both of them were veri ill and
hysterical, and it was only after considerable discussion and
persullosion that they could be induced to ret,urn. to the house
for one more night. Ultimately they did return, and lVlr. X.
went upstairs to wash his hands. Then came his turn to be again
startled. As he was passing the spare room he declares. that he dis-
tinctly heard a woman's whisper, saying, "Hark! the master of the
house has returned; we must depart." A sound of footsteps followed.
apparently crossing the room, and then ensued a succession of sobs and

wails, such as might be caused by a female in deep distress. In spite of
all this they went to bed, and passed the night as best they"could. Mrs.
X. was dosed with spirits to induce aleep,-for her husband was
becoming seriously alarmed about her-and the next day they left the
house, taking up their quarters in that of a friendly neighbour. A fort--
night later they took the house which they now occupy, and had their
furniture removed from the troublesome one. This latter has 110W been
empty for the past two months. I had the opportunity of questioning
Mr. and Mrs. X. and the servant separately; their accounts agree
pretty accurately, and the experiences appeo.r to have been distributed
amongst them in this way :-
Mr. X. : Apparition; sounds of footsteps about the rooms, and up
and down stairs; whisperings and sobbings; door-handles tried. Mrs.
X.: Sighs and groans; raps; sounds of footsteps (similar to those
heard by her husband); door-handles tried. Servant: Sighs and
groans; raps; footsteps (similar to those heard by her master and
mistress) and confused whispering in the spare room, from which room
her bedroom leads. The little girl who heard the sighs, groans, and
raps, in company with Mrs. X. and the servant, can testify to that
effect, but I was unable to see her. From the manner in which their
evidence was given, and from their own remarks, it seems pretty clear
that it has been repeated to one and another a considerable number of
times, and the little differences of detail, which evidently once existed
in the impressions of each, have now been corrected and straightened
out, until the accounts form a fairly harmonious whole. It is clear that
the matter has been well talked over amongst their immediate
neighbours, and Mr. and Mrs. X. have come in for a large
amount of croas-questioning, doubt, and ridicule. Three times
& few friends, with Mr. X., have watched in the house
at night, but nothing has happened, with the exception of
noises purposely made in the next house, with the object of
frightening the watchers for a joke. The disturbances are said to have-
mostly occurred between 10 and 12 at night. I went about 10 o'clock
with Mr. X. to examine the house, and stayed there about two
hours. It is a very tiny place, and .consists of a basement, groun"d
flool', and first floor. . The kitchen is little better than n. cellar, and,
although the house is not at all old, its construction is not of a modern
kind. The street door opens right into the front room, and no space is
lost in unnecessary passages, or landings. The foot of the staircase
which leads to the first Hoor is right in the back ground-floor room.
The house is semi-detached, and has a garden in front, and a yard at
the back, which is separated from the side road by a brick wall. In
this yard men have been known to get, and the shutters were once
tried by someone who was heard to decamp over the wall.

.Any noise made in the side road by passers-by could be
plainly heard in the back room (the room in which the
sighs were heard) and the small size of the house renders
movements in the adjoining premises plainly audit>le. I, myself, heard
strange sounds, but could account for nearly all of them. They were
eaused by the next door people going up and down stairs, by their fire
being poked, by their voices, by passers in the street, and by the
vibration of distant carts. In addition to these there were some sounds
which I could not exactly localise or account for, but they only consisted
of such creaks and strains as one is almost sure to hear in a completely
empty house, or, indeed, in any other house if intently listened for.
Such is the result of my inquiries. The evidence seems strong and
decisive, and is now not easily shaken, but it is the opinion of the friends
and neighbours with whom I came in contact that the apparition was
due to a dream image; the sighs heard by Mrs. X. and the other two
were probably attributable to some cause existing in the side road-the
effect of which cause upon the trio in the back parlour was probably
heightened by the growing conviction that the house was haunted. The
other noises are popularly accounted for by ascribing them to the
natural ones made in the next house, and I can well conceive that a
watchful imagination might be well fed from this source alone. Mr. X.
is aaid to be imaginative and somewhat excitable, and it is suggested
that upon returning from work, and finding his wife and servant in
hysterics, his combined feelings of nervousness, and determination not
to be frightened in his own house, caused him to construe the wheezing
and coughing of the woman next door into the whispered sentence that
"the master had returned"; the former emotion being responsible for
the illusion, and the latter for its character. The words,
.. Hark! the master has returned, we must depart" were heard
proceeding from the dark spare bedroom, and I must confess that
when I stood in this room and listened to the gasps of the patient
next door (for'slle was coughing 110 great deal that night) the same
thoughts had occurred to me before they were revived by the
neighbours, At any rate, such is the substance of the belief of one
~ho spent a night watching in the house. For my own part, if
I had not heard the account of the disturbances fir,t-lw,nd, I
should unhesitatingly say, after an examination of the house and its
surroundings, that they are to be satisfactorily accounted for upon a
purely natural and easily found basis. But when one hears the
emphatic way in which Mr. X. declares that he was wide awake when
he saw the apparition, and heal'S Mrs. X. and the servant deckre that
the sighs were undoubtedly in tlUJ room, and not outside the window,
it is felt that they either must have seen and heard what is stated, or
that self-deception was at work to a. very considerable extent. In

listening to their evidence, howeyer, one has an uneasy feeling that the
f~uent repetition and l'tH'xamination of their experiences has pro-
duced a more vivid impression of the minute circumstances than
originally existed. In other words, one feels that the account has
grown. Mrs. X. is a very young woman, very voluble, and fond of
ventilating her religious creed. She seems quickly to jump to uncharit-
able conclusions, for her theory is that because the harmless old landlady
does not care to recognise the supposed haunt as a fact, it necessarily
proves that her husband, who died peacefully in the house, must have
murdered a baby, or been guilty of some other crime for which he is
condemned to haunt the premises. This is considered to be a very
satisfactory explanation of the old lady's lack of sympathetic interest
in the matter; and her attempts to quell a report which might prove
damaging to her property ate at once hailed as sufficient proof that her
husband was the ghost, and plainly show a desire to shield his sin, and
conceal its ghostly consequences. Such a mental attitude on the part
of the principal witness seems materially to detract from the effect
which her account might otherwise have.
The house 1S again let, and is to be taken possession of on Monday,
November 24th, 1884. The in-coming tenants are aware of the report
connected with it, and treat it with scorn. Perhaps the further
development of the matter may be safely left in their hands.

NOTES ON THE DIRECT TRANSFERENCE OF BRAIN-
IMPRESSIONS.
To THE SECRETARY OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.
Sm,-I understand that the Society for Psychical Research invites com-
munications on the above subject, more generally known under what is, in
my opinion, tho misleading term of "Thought-reading." For some con-
siderable time I have been engaged at intervals in experiments of this nature.
and I have arrived at certain generalisations which I think may be helpful
to others engaged in similar experiments. No doubt, here as elsewhere, the
"personal equation" will have to be taken into account, but I do not think
it will greatly modify the rosults attained.
My objects have been to ascertain by personal experiments (1) whether
it is possible to transfer an impression made on one brain directly to another
without the use of any of the ordinary channels of communication, and
(2), if so, the conditions under which the transference is made. In almost
all eases an ordinary pack of cards was used to supply the brain-pictures.
It did not take long to convince me that this direct transference of a
l)icture from one- brain to another was possible. In fact, I was soon struck
by the comparative facility of the operation under favourable conditions. I
allow that my method of estimating results was not exactly that laid down
by other observers. I attached (n.s I still attach) less importance than others
to absolute accuracy in the transfervnce of the picture. In such cases, as it
8eems to me, the results are to be judged, not by mathematical, but logical
laws. The point to be considered is this: Is there a reasonable certainty
that the picture has been seen, although, perhaps, not with absolute distinct-
neBB 1 The following record of expgriments made on the 2nd February, 1885.
with the help of Mr. W. S. Riley, will illustrate my meaning. (There were
no second guesses.)

Now it seems to me that ill the above list there is no reasonable doubt
that, in addition to Nos. 3 and 12, which are absolutely correct,

:.careb,1885.1 Journal of Society for P8!lchical Re8ew·cit. 319
Nos. 1,4,5,6,7, 1Q, 11, 13.were also seen by the percipient, though with
varying degrees of clearness; and that, therefore, in the whole list of
15 cards there were really only 5 (if 80 many) of which no impression was
·conveyed. And I consider that such a list is at least as valuable as another
shorter one which I might give, in which, out of 6 cards, 4 were transferred
with perfect accuracy to the brain of the percipient.
I have taken much pains to find out what is the nature of the impression
made on the percipient ;·and I have come to the conclusion that, in the large
majority of cases in which the answer is correct, the impression made is
pictorial. It is not a suggestion, but an actual image that is conveyed.
Sometimes a suggestion is imagined, but in this case the answer is generally
wrong. I have often asked: "Did you seem to sce the card 1" without
giving a hint as to whether the card named were right or wrong. Almost
invariably when the card was wrong, the percipient (llOt knowing the fact)
would reply: "No, I didn't see it; but something seemed to tell me it was
that one." On other occasions, when the card was rightly named, the
percipient (equally uncertain of the fact) would say: "Yes; I seemed to
see that quite distinctly."
This view was confirmed by my own experience as percipient. I have
had but little practice in this capacity, and have on various OccasiOllS entirely
failed to get any l'esults wortll mentioning; but 011 two occasiOll8 I was mOI'e
fortunate. On one of these I named rightly several figures in succession.
Now, these figures I saw most distinctly with my eyes closed; they appeared
somewhat large, and distinctly, though faintly, luminous against a back-
ground of darkness; and when I saw them I had the absolute conviction
that they were the right ones. On another occasion I saw in much the same
way some cards, but not with the same distinctneBB. The card would appear
and disappear so rapidly that I had a difficulty in counting the pips. It was,
for instance, very difficult tl) distinguish between an eight and a 10. It was
equally difficult to make out the suit. There was abeolutely 110 indication of
colour. When I had satisfied my mind that the card was a 10, it looked
something like the 10 of diamonds, but with the sharp comers of the
diamonds rounded oft'. It proved to be the 10 of clubs. .
Being convinced that, in my experiments at any rate, tlle impression con-
veyed was pictorial, I endeavoured, by tlle aid of a black bandage, to make
the darkness as complete as pOBBible before the eyes of tlle percipient whilst
I arranged for a'very bright light to fall upon the card. My best results
have been secured under these conditions. Anotller important point seemed
to be to devise some means by which the instant of transference should be
accentuated. At first I tried saying "one-two-threc-" the "three" to
be the crisis point, but, fancying that the suggestion of any numbers might
have a tendency to confuse, I substituted three taps 011 the card, the third
being harder than the previous two. It is, I think, impoBBible to keep the
mind concentrated on a particular card, nor do I think it neceBSarily an
advantage to try to do 80. I believe the transmiBBion and tlle perception to
be an instantaneous process which may be repeated, but cannot be sustained.
I do not think that the attempt at repetition is very often successful, as the
impreslion has already lost its freshness. For this reason I 800n gave up
allowing or attempting second .. tries." Many of the cards seen with

absolute correctness were named in a moment. On the other hand carda
which took a long time to see were either entirely wrong or only partially
right.
To sum up, I come to the conclusion that in my experiments the impres-
sion made was pictorial; that it was conveyed instantaneously; that colour
could not be conveyed but form only (spades were constantly confused with
hearts). In this connection I may mention that I have never succeeded in
getting the ace of spades correctly named. It has always been described as
a coun-card.
I may add a few other details. In my experience the sensitiveness
requisite for the reception of brain.impressions is very evanescent. In the
great bulk of my experiments the carda first taken were the ones moat readily
and clearly seen. The faculty was practically exhausted after about 10 or
12 attempts. I may mention that, after two decided failures, I always
now break off. It is, in my opinion, most important to allow nothing to
occur which would tend to weaken the faith of operatoror percipient in their
respective powers. I attribute, in fact, a great part of what success I have
achieved to my constant efforts to convinco the percipient of the possibility
of seeing the cards. A long record of failures is most disheartening and
indeed paralysing. The impression of even a single failure is to be avoided
if poss~ble. For this reason I do not endorse what your committee say in
circular No. I : "If tho first trial is a failure, the percipient should learn that
fact from the silence of the experimenter." In my opinion he should be
carefully guardod from learning that fact at all until the experiments are
over. This is another reason why no second trial should be allowed, as II.
second trial implies failure in the first.
It sometimes happens that two cards present themselves successively to
the mind of the percipient. As a rule, in this case I found that it was the
first which was the right one, or the nearost to the right one. On the few
occasions when it was not so, the second card was described as appearing
much moro vividly and distinctly than tho first.
On somo occasions the sCance has been a complete failure. On these
occasions there has always been some obvious physical reason, such as a cold
on the part ot the percipient or myself, or the presence of some visitor who,
without intending it, introduced 0. disturbing element. It is this last
difficulty that makes it almost useless to try to reproduce the experiments
before strangers. The slightest uneAsiness on the part of the percipient, or
even over·anxiety to succeed, is sufficient to destroy the sensitiveness.
I might add more, but I will not trespass further on your space. On
some future occasion I hope to furnish some notes with respect to clair-
voyance.-I am, faithfully yours,
