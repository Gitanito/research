             		Experience Description   

  I'll describe it briefly here because I've already written a book with the experience. Actually I think I will copy and paste some here:  It had been barely two months since I moved to this small town so I had decided to give myself a three month 'vacation' to do an intensive meditation retreat at home, before going back to a regular job. That particular day was a cold January morning, there was still some snow outside. The landscape was white but the worst of that harsh winter was already behind. This small Canadian town had experienced a lot more snow than usual that winter. I was sitting cross-legged in the couch in my living room. I had been meditating for about half an hour already that morning.

  Suddenly what I was seeing in my third eye seemed to change texture. It had already been changing texture for the past three or four days, it was different from what it had been during almost 30 years that I had been meditating. I began to see with my inner eye that what used to be lights and shapes became something viscose, some sort of thick liquid. Thanks to this I was able to focus even better and managed to concentrate even deeper.

  Suddenly, a strange and very distinct sensation in my seventh chakra caught my attention. At the same time I felt as if my consciousness were leaking through it. I then realized that the strange sensation in my seventh chakra was actually the beginning of an orgasm ... and that the consciousness that was leaking out of my body ... was actually me!

  I was completely aware of being the consciousness that was 'leaking' out of the physical body. I felt like a liquid that was being expelled by my body. I could not believe it. Even though I knew it was an out of body experience, I did not understand exactly what type of bizarre journey this would be because it was so different from the other out of body experiences I had had in my life. I have had a couple of 'regular', spontaneous astral projections, like those almost everyone has when you suddenly wake up floating somewhere and you do not even know how you got there but you enjoy flying and floating around.   The OBE of that particular day was like nothing I had ever experienced before. When I found myself completely out of my body, through my seventh chakra, I saw how my personality dropped... 'Oops, there goes Myriam!' Was my first thought. After I saw my personality drop and disintegrate I saw my concepts, my ideas, my beliefs and, finally, the whole creation -with duality within it- fall off of me. It was as if I had surrendered them, released them, as if I had detached from them. They felt like costumes that I had been wearing and was finally free of.

  I then realized that it was not that my body was expelling me but that I, as a consciousness, by letting go of my attachments to my personality, ideas, concepts, believes, etc. was actually freeing myself. I was getting rid of those heavy objects that had been keeping me from going up and had kept me bound to the Creation and to the duality within it. 

  Once outside my body -as a consciousness- right above me, in that space between a physical body that had already been left behind in another dimension and a void, which I perceived as a black empty space, after all my concepts and the Creation itself had fallen off of me and disintegrated, there was a gigantic mass of luminous consciousness. Just as the Buddha described it.  Huge. It was like an ocean but above, sort of upside down. A sea of pure consciousness, nothing but consciousness, just as Kabir had also described it. It started up and continued upwards, I did not see its end neither side wise nor upwards, I could only see its beginning above me. After I surrendered the Creation, which was the last of the concepts that I surrendered, I felt as if a magnet attracted me very quickly towards the mass of luminous consciousness that I immediately recognized as God. Then I realized that 'it'... was actually me! I was like a droplet of that gigantic mass of consciousness but in reality I was also that huge consciousness, the luminous consciousness.  I, little drop of consciousness, now free from the illusion, returned to where I have always belonged: to the huge Ocean of Luminous Consciousness whom we call God.  I saw myself, I felt myself, I existed as and I knew myself to be God.

  By the way, when I refer to me or myself I'm not referring to the organism that lives under the name of Myriam, but to me as a pure consciousness part of that huge mass of Consciousness.  In reality I (and you too) am God.  

  When merging with the huge Consciousness once again (yes, you realize that you have always been 'It' and that, although you were separated for a while, you have now returned to yourself) you understand why Jesus stated: 'I and My Father Are ONE'.  You realize that absolutely nothing is real but you (as the Luminous Consciousness). You feel SO complete, SO whole ... the level of totality that you experience there is indescribable and does not exist within the Creation itself. Within the Creation, even in the highest Heavens or spiritual planes, there is duality but outside of the Creation there is only the complete and whole I AM.

  For what seems like a brief second in the physical world you become God and get a lot of information that you understand later on.  As I returned to my physical body I had to pull my head forward to return it to its regular position. It had dropped back when I left my body.

Did you feel separated from your body?      No    I clearly left my body and existed outside it  

How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        Normal consciousness and alertness   It was not necessarily different, I'm anyway, very conscious and alert all the time. My intuition has been very good for the past few years.  

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         All the time  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         Incredibly fast  

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning     Time is a concept of the duality within all planes of the Creation. Even eternity is a concept of the Creation. There was no time, no eternity no no-time, outside of the Creation you simply are as the Huge Consciousness that permeats every inch of the Creation and gives 'life' to everything, although everything if false because nothing really exists. Only the Huge Consciousness exists.  

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         More vivid than usual  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       As good as in my everyday vision and as real.  

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      I didn't pay attention to my hearing, everything was happening withing my consciousness, I didn't need 'ears' or 'hearing', I just knew.

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Incredible joy  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       No

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Other or several faiths   I was born and raised Roman Catholic but I consider myself simply spiritual. I've been practicing meditation for almost 30 years. I got initiated at the age of 19 on a spiritual path that promised to take me to God. It sure did.  

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     Oh yes. I make sure to always do my best and not get upset and, especially, not get angry. I have a strange skill now, I can vibrate something in my head at will and it feels really nice =). Also, when I meditate now deep concentration comes almost right away.  

What is your religion now?         Other or several faiths   Simply spiritual.  

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     I had already studied a lot of spiritual books so everything made sense, however, experiencing the actual phenomenon and being able to verify everything I had read was quite a different experience from what I had imagined. I was able to understand why the Buddha called it the Luminous Consciousness, why the Sikh Masters had called it the Ocean of Consciousness and why Jesus had said I and My Father are One.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I have the absolute certainty that God is everywhere orchestrating the whole Creation.  I know I am God, but not as Myriam, but as a pure consciousness. I know everyone and everything else is also God and I can see how they are oblivious to it.  

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin   It was pure consciousness but it was not necessarly a 'being' (beings imply there are no-beings and the Consciousness is the only real 'thing' there is in and out of the Creation).  

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     Yes, but it's different from what we know. Unity is of the mind. So is lack of Unity. Unity and lack of it are part of duality, part of this creation. Plain BEING is of God. I was going to say that 'we' are God but in reality there is no 'we'. Only God exists. Within duality, within the Creation, egos/minds exist and they see separation. It's as if within the Creation we (the organisms) were fractals of God. Within the Creation yes, there is oneness as God in it's most subtle form. But even this oneness is imperfect when comparted to God in its pure essence outside of the Creation where he simply IS. It's hard to understand this concept because it doesn't exist within duality, within the field of the mind, not even a vivid imagination can fathom the ultimate aspect of God.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     Oh, yes. God  most certainly exists.  The ultimate aspect of God, though, is pure consciousness. He (He is not a 'he' because he is beyond duality and encompasses everything, he is simply a consciousness but for the sake of simplicity in communication I will continue to refer to God as 'he'). This pure consciousness permeates every atom in the Creation whether of the physical worlds or the highest spiritual planes. Without him nothing would seem to exist because in reality on he 'exists', or rather , only he IS.  The mind and ego are part of this duality, together with Time.  As long as God is 'within' something or someone that something or someone exists, when God withdraws himself 'life' ceases to exist for that something or someone.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Uncertain   I think I don't understand the question.  Special knowledge for me or for humanity? Either way I didn't get any information for humanity, as far as the purpose of this organism by the name of Myriam she's just to go on with the life she had chosen already since before being born. Once this body dies the drop of pure consciousness within her will merge back in the ocean of luminous consciousness.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     Everyone is free to do whatever they want, to experience whatever they want to experience. However no one is free from the consequences of their actions. If someone wants to use this life to become aware of his purest aspect as God he is free to do so. If someone wants to experience extreme individuality and egotism he is also free to do so.  

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists     Yes     Within the Creation we -with our minds and egos- are infinite. Outside the Creation we are God. After we manage to leave the circle of death and rebirth we will continue as God only. So yes, there is life after a physical death, whether you reincarnate in a physical body, spend some time in the spiritual planes or escape from the Illusion of duality.  

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes     Trust in God, is paramount to being able to go back to him and to merge back in him.  Trust in his will in whatever shape or form it may come to us. Because God truly is in charge and everywhere.  I was shown how God gives life to the whole Creation and truly nothing exists or happens without him. We just need to learn to recognize his hand in everything and through everyone.  

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes     They are difficulties only for the individualistic ego. In reality God is everywhere and in everything and everything works perfectly as per his design. There is no evil per se, what is evil for some can be beneficial for others. It's just a matter of adjusting our perception and finding the goodness, GOD, in everything and everyone.  

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     Love is what resembles most, within the duality of the creation, our purest state as God. However love, as we know it here, only exists within duality because love is what attracts and brings together our broken parts as God. It brings the fractals closer together. Where there is no separation there is no love as we know it.  This came to me as a shock.  Just remember how you feel when you are happily and relaxed enjoying a bath in the bathtub, can you say you feel love for yourself?  You will be experiencing a lot of very pleasant feelings but you can't really say you are experiencing the love you feel towards your puppy, or your child towards yourself when you are in the bathtub. By the way, I'm talking about the pure love, the one that manifests as caring for and cherishing someone, not sexual attraction. Lust is of the ego/mind and it keeps duality and separation alive.  

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life     I left the creation and experienced my self as God, the ultimate aspect of God. I didn't even think anything would change in my physical me until I noticed things did change.  I can not feel negative emotions deeply. I mean I can however now I feel they are hurting me, I feel the pain in my physical body so I've stopped feeling too angry, if something upsets me I try to get angry only on a very 'superficial' level otherwise I feel pain. I'm able to fully remove my headaches in a second when before it used to take me a couple of minutes. When I think of something I see it in the physical world in one shape or another a few minutes later, or a few hours. When I wonder something about the Creation or what decision to make I get my answer at the latest in a couple of days.  My intuition is SUPER clear now, 100% Clear. Perhaps a few other things that now I can't remember.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I'm more welcoming and understanding towards everyone.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   Absolutely, it is impossible to describe with words and languages from the Creation something that is from outside the Creation.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  The experience seems to have left an imprint. It didn't happen in the physical world so the imprint seems deeper in my mind that the things I remember happened in the physical world.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     100% clear intuition. Able to remove my headaches at once. I haven't tried with other pains or diseases not only because I don't get sick often but because I know that a disease is an attempt to rebalance energy, a disease is trying to tell me what I need to change to restore balance and I don't want to simply shut it.  I haven't tried to see if I have any 'gifts' because I know that God is in charge of it all and doesn't need help other than we trying our best to do our best =)  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Yes, I could not believe it when I left my body and realized I left it as pure consciousness, I could not believe it when I saw the huge ocean of luminous consciousness above me, I could not believe it when I realized I was actually that same huge luminous ocean of consciousness. It was amazing =)  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I told my brother and a couple of friends a week or two after the experience. I have been practicing meditation for this purpose for almost 30 years so everyone was familiar with my believes.  They listened carefully and enjoyed my story. I don't think they were influenced, they were very glad to hear about God. I also started writing a book 6 months after the experience. I recently published the English version of it by the title 'Becoming the Luminous Ocean'.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   I was aware that some civilizations believed in reincarnation since a child in school that we learned about the Egyptians.  My grandpa often had encounters with 'ghosts' so to me hearing about this phenomena was normal. I myself once had a weird experience with energy of some sort, I didn't see what shook the chandelier so I can't say it was a 'ghost' per se.  I think I learned from my grandfather who had encounters with ghost about NDE because he was also a surgeon and in the medical community they share their experiences with one another.    Do I think that my knowledge about NDE influenced this experience in any way? No, I don't think so because I had no idea that I was going to leave my body through the top of my head and that it was going to feel so real.  In my case I was not in a hospital so there were no gadgets attached to me to prove that I was fully out of my body, but I did see myself disintegrate and cease to exist when I dropped my personality and conepts and beliefs, etc.  No, I don't think all the knowledge I had influenced my experience in any way because the experience itself was nothing like what I had ever imagined.  

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     There was no question about the reality of it. You are you anyway, you are aware and experiencing everything with your five senses just as we do here in the physical plane.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     Strange question, perhaps it's being asked by someone who has never experienced not even an OBE and still has questions about the validity of this phenomena.  It is absolutely real.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Uncertain   I don't understand the question.  

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         It gives a lot of freedom to ratify that what the ancient Masters told us is true. We truly can merge with God, we truly can meet him and we truly are him in a way we can't even imagine.  And he/I/we is absolutely awesome.  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         I think you did a great job. I can't think of any other question.
