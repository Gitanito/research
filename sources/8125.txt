The most important thing was, wrapped in an incredible peacefulness; I thought to myself, 'So this would be the other life.' I felt no sadness on that account.

After a bit, I awoke in a hospital room and, although the experience was still vivid, I was happy to be alive, as several people were asking me how I felt.
