The PREFACE
TO THE
SECOND EDITION.
THIS
Second Edition of this Work*
notwith(landing a large ImpreJJton
of the Fir
ft, is a Certificatefromthe
World ofits
general Acceptation &amp;gt;
(b we need
not, according to the Cuftom of Editors, boaft
of it without Evidence, or tell a F b in
its Favour.
The Subject is fingular, and it has been
handled after a fingular Manner : The wife
World has been pleafed with ity the merry
World has been diverted with it, and the ig
norant World has been taught by it 5 none
but the malicious part ofthe World has been
offended at it : Who can wonder, that when
the Devil is not fleafed, his Friends fhould
be angry?
The flrangeft thing of it all is, to hear
Satan complain that the Story is handled
prephanely : But who can think it
ftrange that
his Advocates foouid BE, what he was from
the Beginning ?
The Author affirms, and has good Vouchers
for it (in the Opinion ofJach whofe Judg
ment paffts with him for an Authority} that
the whole Tenor of the Work is folemny cal
culated to promoteferious Religion y and ca
pable of being improv d in a religious manner.
But he does not think that we are bound ne
ver to [peak of the Devil but with an Air

of Terror, as if we were always afraidofhim*
Tit evident the Devil, as fubtle and as
frightful as he is, has affed the ridiculous
and foolifh &quot;Party as much as moft of Gods
Creatures, and daily does fo. And he can
not believe tis any Sin to expofe him for a
foolifh Devil/ as he is, or fhew the World
that he may be laugh d at.
Thofe that think the SubjeEt not handled
with Gravity enough, have all the Room .
given them in the World to handle it better ;
and as the Author profeffes he is far from
thinking his Tiece perfeh
[
, they ought not to
be angry that he gives them leave to mend it.
He has had the Satisfaction to fleafe fome
Readers? and to fee good Men approve it--,
and for the reft? as my Lord Rocheftery^/,r
in another Cafe, .
He counts their Cenfure Fame.
As for a certain Reverend Gentleman,
who is pieafedgravely to diflike the Work (he
hopes, rather for the Author s fake than the
Devil s)
he only fays, Let the Performance
be how it will, and the Author what he will,
it is
apparent he has not yet preach d away
all his Hearers.
It is
enough to me (fays the Author] that
the Devil himfelf is not pleafed with my
Work, and lefs with the &quot;Dejign of it ; let
the Devil and all his fellow Complainers
ftand on one fide, and the honeft, well mean
ing, charitable World, who approve my Work,
on the other, and 111 tell
Nofes with Satan,
if he dares.

CHAP. I.
Being an Introduction to the whole Work.
1
Doubt not but the title of this book will
amufe fome of my reading friends a little at
firfl j they will make apaufe, perhaps, as they
do at a witch s
prayer, and be fome time a re-
folving whether they had bed look into it or no,
left
they fhould really raife the Devil by reading
his ftory.
Children and old women have told thcmfelves Co
many frightful things oftheDevil^ and have form M
ideas of him in their minds, in fo
many horrible
and monftrous fhapes, that really it were enough
to fright the JDmVhimfelf, to meet himfelf in the
dark, drefs
dup in the feveral figures which imagi
nation has form d for him in the minds of men 3
and as for themfelves, I cannot think by any
means that the Devil would terrify them half
B fo
2 The HISTORY
fo much, if they were to converfe face to face
with him.
It mud certainly therefore be a moil ufeful un
dertaking to give the truehiftory ofihisTyranfof
the air, this God of the world, this terror and aver-
fion of mankind, which we call Devil; to {hew
what he is, and what he is NOT, where he is, and
where he is NOT, when he is IN us, and when he
is NOT j for I cannot doubt but that the Devil
is
really and bona fide in a great many of our ho
ned weak-headed friends, when they themfelves
know nothing of
^ie
matter.
Nor is the work fo difficult as fome may ima
gine. The Devil s
hiftory is not fo hard to come
at, as it feems to be ; His original and the firft rife
of his family is-
upon record, and as for his con
duct, he has acted indeed in the dark, as to me
thod in many things j but in general, as
cunning
as he is, he has been fool enough to expofe hitn-
felf in fome of the moil coniiderable tranfa&ions
of his Life, and has not {hewn himfelf a politi
cian at all: Our old friend Mdtcbiavcl outdid him
in many things, and I may in the procefs of this
work give an account of feveral of the fons of
jlclam) and fome focieties of em too, who have
out-witted the Devil, nay, who have out-fin d
the Devil, and that I think may be call d out-
{hooting him in his own bow.
It may perhaps be expected of me in this hi-
ftory, that imce I feem inclined to (peak favoura
bly of Satan, to do him juflice, and to write his
ilory impartially, J fliotild take fome pains to tell
you what religion he is of3 and even this part may
not be fo much a jclt, as at firft fight you may
take it to be 3 for Satan has fomething of reli
gion in him, I aflure you j nor is he fuch an un
profitable Devil that way, as fome may fuppofe
him to be 3 for tho , in reverence to my brethren,
.
i t will
of the DEVIL. f
1 will not reckon him among the Clergy 5 No not
fo much as a gifted Brother, yet I cannot deny,
but that he often preaches, and if it be not pro
fitably to his hearers j tis as much their fault,
as it is out of his defign&amp;gt;
It has indeed been fuggefled that he has taker!
orders, and that a certain Pope, famous for being
an extraordinary favourite of his, gave him both
inftitution and induction 5 but as this is not up
on record, and therefore we have no authentic
document for the probation, I ihall not affirm it
for a truth, for I would not {lander the Devil.
It is faid alfo, and I am apt to believe it, that he
was very familiar with that holy father Pope Sifaef-
ter II. and fome charge him with perfonating Pope
Hildebrand on an extraordinary occafion, and him-
felf fitting
in the chair apoftolick, in a full con
gregation j and you may hear rriore of this here
after : But as I do not meet with Pope Diabolus
among the lift 5 in all father PlatincCs lives of the
Popes, fo I am willing to leave it as I find it.
But to fpeak to the point, and a nice point it is
I acknowledge j namely, what religion the Devil
is ofj my anfwer will indeed be general, yet not
at all
ambiguous, for I love to fpeak pofitively and
with undoubted evidence.
I . He is a leliever. And if in faying fo it fhould
follow, that even the Devil has more religion
than fome of our men of fame can at this
time be charged with, I hope my Lord -
and his Grace the of and fome of
the upper clafs in the red-hot club, will not
wear the coat, however well it
may fit to
their fhapes, or challenge the Satyr, as if it
were pointed at them, becaufe tis due to
them : In a word, whatever their Lordfhips
B a arc,
4 The H I S T O R Y
are, I can allure them that the Devil is no
Infidel.
2. He fears God. We have fuch abundant evi
dence of this in facred Hiftory, that if I were
not at prefent, in common with a few others,
talking to an infidel fort of Gentlemen, with
whom thofe remote things call d Scriptures
are not allow d in evidence, I might fay it
was fufficiently prov d \ but I doubt not in
the procefs of this undertaking to {hew, that
the Devil really fears God, and that after ano*
ther manner than ever he fear d Saint Prances
or Saint Dunftan ; and if that be proved, as
I take upon me to advance, I {hall leave it
to judgment, who s the better Chriitian, the
Devil who believes and trembles, or our mo
dern gentry of who believe neither God
mr DeviL
Having thus brought the Devil within the Pale,
I {hall leave him among you for the prefent j not
but that I may examine in its order who has the
hefl claim to his brotherhood, the Papifts or the
ProteftantS} and among the latter the Lutherans or
theCalviniftsj and fodefcending to all thefeveral
denominations of churches, fee who has lefs otthe
Devil m them, and who morej and whether lefs
or more the Devil has not a feat in every fyna-
gogue, a pew in every church, a place in every
pulpit, and a vote in every fynodj even from the
Sanhedrim of the Jews, to our friends at the
Bull and Mouth, &c. from the greateit to the
leaft.
It will, I confefs, come very much within the
compals of this part of my difcourfe, to give an ac
count, or at leaft make an effay toward it,
of the
fliare the Devil has had in the fpreading religion
in the world $ and efpecially of dividing and fubdi-
4 viding
tftfo DEVI L. 5
viding opinions in religion 3 perhaps, to eke it out
and make it reach the farther &amp;gt;
and alfo to fhew
how far he is or has made himfelf a miffionary of
the famous clan de propaganda fide
-
9 it is true, we
find him heartily employed in almofr,
every cor
ner of the world adpi opagandum errorem : But that
may require a hiflory by it felf.
As to his propagating religion, tis a little hard
indeed, at firit
fight, to charge the Devil with
propagating religion, that is to fay, if we take it
literally, and in the grofs ; but if
you take it as
the Scots infilled to take the oath of fidelity, viz.
with an explanation^ it is
plain Satan Ms very
often had a fhare in the method, if not in the
defign of propagating the chriftian faith : For ex
ample.
1 think I do no injury at all to the Devil, to fay
that he had a great hand in the old holy war^ as
it was ignorantly and enthufiailically called $
flirring up the chriflian princes and powers of
Europe to run a madding after the Turks and Sara-
cens^ and make warwith thofe innocent people above
a thoufand miles off, only becaufp they entred in
to God s
heritage when he Kad forfaken it&amp;gt;
grazed upon his ground when he had fairly ttirn d
it into a common, and laid it
open for the next
corner^ fpending their nation s treafure, and embark
ing their kings and people, (I fay) in a war above
a thoufand miles off, filling their heads with that
religious madnefs, call d, in thofe days, holy zeal
to recover the terra fancla^ the fepulchers of thrift
and the Saints, and as they call d it
falily, \\\eholy
city^ tho true religion fays it was the accurfed city,
and not worth fpending one drop of blood for.
This religious Bubble was certainly of Satan^
who, as he craftily drew them in, fo like a true
Devil he left them in the lurch when they came
there, fac d about to the Saracens^ animated the
B 3 immor-
6 The HISTORY
immortal Saladln againft them, and manag d fq
dexteroufly that he left the bones of about thir
teen or fourteen hundred thoufond Chriftians there
as a trophy of his infernal politicks &amp;gt;
and after the
chriftian world had run a In fanta terra^ or in
Englijh) a faunfring-jfobutz. hundred year, he dropt
it to play another game lefs foolifh, but ten times
wickeder than that which went before it, namely^
turning the cruiadoes of the Chriftians one againit
another} and, as Iludibras foid in another cafe,
&quot;
Made them fight like mad or drunk
tt For dame religion as for punk.
Of this you have a compleat account in the
hiftory of the Popes decrees againft the Count
de Ihoukufe^ and the Waldenfes and A.lbigenfes^ with
the crufiidoes and maffacres which followed upon
them, wherein to do the Devir$ politicks fome
juftice, he met with all the fuccefs he could de-
fire &amp;gt;
the zealots of that day executed his in
fernal orders moft punctually, and planted religi*
on in thofe countries in a glorious and triumphant
manner, upon the deftruction of an infinite num
ber of innocent people, whole blood has atten d
the foil for the growth of the Catholick faith, in
a manner very particular, and to Satan s full fatis-
tac~l:ion.
I might, to compleat this part of his hiftory,
give you the detail of his progrefs in thefe firft
iteps of his alliances with Rome; and add a long
lift of mafllicres, wars, and expeditions in behalf
of religion, which he has had the honour to have
a vifible hand in ; fuch as the Pariftan maflacre, the
Fkmijh war under the Duke d Aha^ the Smitfy-
pdd fires in the Marian days in England, and the
maflacres in Ireland; all which would moft effec
tually convince us that; the Devil has not been
idle.
of the DEVIL; 7
idle iti his bufinels j but I
may meet with thefe
again in my way, tis enough, while I am upon
the generals only, to mention them thus in a fum-
mary way j I
fay, tis
enough to prove that the
Devil has really been as much concerned as any
body, in the methods taken by fome people for
propagating the chriftian religion in the world.
Some have rafhly, and I had almoil fatd mali-
cioufly charg d the Devil with the great triumphs
of his friends the Spaniards in America,
and would
place the conqueit of Mexico and Pent to the cre
dit of his account.
But I cannot join with them in this at all, I
mufl (ay, I believe the Devil was innocent of that
matter j my reafon is, becaufe, Satan was never
fuch a fool as to fpend his time, or his politicks,
or embark his allies to conquer nations who were
already his ownj that would be Satan againit
Beelzebub^ making war upon himfelf, and at lead
doing nothing to the purpofe.
If they fhould charge him, indeed, with de
luging Philip II. of Spain into that prcpofterous at
tempt call d the Armada^ (anglice^ the Spanijh Inva-
fionj I fhould indeed more readily join with them j
but whether he did it
weakly, in hope, which was
indeed not likely, that it fhould fucceed j or wick
edly, to deflroy that great fleet ofthe Spaniards, and
draw them within the reach of his own do
minions, the elements j this being a queftion which
authors differ exceedingly about, I fhall leave it
to decide it felf.
But the greater! piece of management, which we
find the Devilhzs concerned himielf in of late, in the
matter of religion, fecms to be that ofthe mhTion
into China j and here indeed Satan has afted his
mailer-piece: It was, no doubt, much for his fer-
vice, that the Chinefes fhould have no infight in
to matters of religion, I mean, that we call chrifc
B 4
S The HSITORY
tian j and therefore, tho Popery and the Devil arc
not at fo much variance as fome may imagine, yet
he did not think it fafe to let the general fyilem
of Chriftianity be heard of among them in China.
Hence when the name of the chriftian religion
had but been received with fome feeming appro
bation in the country of Japan^ Satan imme
diately, as if alarm d at the thing, and dread
ing what the confequence of it
might be, arm d
the Japonefes again ft it with fuch fury, that they
expelPd it at once.
It was much fafer to his
defigns, when, if the
flory be not a fiction, he put that Dutch witicifm.
into the mouths of the States commanders, when
they came to Japan j who having more wit than
to own themfelves Chriftians in fuch a place as
that, when theqncftionwasput to them, anfwer-
ed negatively, nat they were not^ but that they
were of another religion call d Hollanders.
However, it feems the diligent Jefuits out-wit-
ted the Devil in Cbina^ and, as I faid above, over-
ihot him in his own Bow 5 for the million being
in danger by the Devil and the Chinefe Emperor&quot;?,
joining together^ of being wholly expelFd there
too, as they had been in Japan^ they cunningly
fell in with the ecclefiafticks of the country, and
joining the prieftcraft of both religions together,
they brought Jefus Chrifl and Confucius to be fo
reconcilable, that the Chinefe and the Roman ido
latry appeared capable of a confederacy, of go
ing on hand in hand together, and confequent-
]y of being very good friends.
This was a matter- piece indeed, and, as they
fay^ almofl frighted Satan out of his wits; but
he being a ready manager, and particularly fa
mous for ferving himfelf of the rogueries of the
priefts,
fac d about immediately to the miffion,
and making a virtue of neceflity, clapt in, with
of the DEVIL 9
all
poffible alacrity^ with the propofal
*
&amp;gt;
fo the
Jejuitszndi
heform d ^hotch-potch of religion made
up of Popery and Paganifm^ and calculated to leave
the latter rather worie than they found it, blind
ing the faith of Chrift and the philofophy or mo
rals of Confucius together, and formally chriften-
ing them by the name qf religion j by which means
the politick intereft of the mrflion was prefer-
ved j and yet Satan loft not one inch of ground
with the Chinefes, no, not by the planting the
Gofpel it felf, fuch as it was, among them.
Nor has it been fuch difadvantage to him that
this plan or fcheme of a new modelled religion
would not go down at Rome,
and that the Inqui-
fition damn d it with Bell, Book and Candle 5 dif-
tance of place ferv d his new allies, the mifliona-
ries, in the Head of a protection from the Inqui-
fition &amp;gt;
and now and then a rich prefent well plac d
found them friends in the congregation it felf5 and
where anyNuncio with his impudent zeal pretended
to take fuch a long voyage to oppofe them, Satan
took care to get him fent back re infeffa, or in-
fpir d the million to move him off the premifles,
by methods of their own (that is to fay, being
interpreted) to murther him.
Thus the miffion has in it felf been truly devilifh^
and the Devil has interefted himfelf in the planting
the chriftian religion in China.
The influence the Devil has in the Politicks of
mankind, is another efpecial part of his hiftory,
and would require, if it were poffible,
a veryexad:
defcription; but here we fhall neceflarily be obli
ged to inquire fo nicely into the Arcana of circum-
itances, and unlock the cabinets of ilate in fo many
\
* N. B. He never refus d fetting his hand to any opinion
which he thought it for his intereft to acknowledged
courts,
10 T^fclSTORY
courts, canvafs the councils of miniftcrs and the
conduct of princes fo fully,
and expofe them fo
much, that it
may, perhaps, make a combuftion
among the great politicians abroad 5 and in doing
that we may come fo near home too, that tho
perfonal fafety and prudentials forbid our med-
ling with our own country, we may be taken in
a double entendre, and fall
unpitied for being only
fufpefted of touching truths that are fo tender,
whether we are guilty or no 5 on thefc accounts
I muft meddle the lefs with that parr, at leaftfor
the prefent.
Be it that the Devil has had a fhare in fome of
the late councils of Europe^ influencing them this
way or that way, to his own advantage, what is
it to us ? For example, What if he has had any
concern in the late affair of ttorn ? What need
we put it
upon him, feeing his confederates the
Jefuites with the Affefforial tribunal of Poland
take it
upon themfelves? I fhall leave that part
to the ifTue of time. I wifh it were as eafy to
perfuade the world that he had no hand in bring
ing the injur d Proteftants to leave the juflice due
to the cries of proteftant blood to the arbitrament
of a popiili power, who dare fay that the Devil
tnuft be in it, if juftice
fhould be obtained that
way : I ihould rather fay, the Devil is in it, or
elfe it would never be expe&ed.
It occurs next to enquire from the premises,
whether the Devil has more influence or lefs in the
affairs of the world now, than he had in former
ages 5 and this will depend upon comparing, as
we go along, his methods and way of working in
paft times, and the modern politicks by which
he acts in our days 5 with the differing reception
which he has met with among th^e men of fuch dif-
tant ages.
But
of the DEVIL. n
But there is fo much to enquire of about the
before we can bring his (lory down to
our modern times, that we muft for the pre-
fent let them drop, and look a little back to
the remoter parts of this hiftory &amp;gt;
drawing his
picture that people may know him when they
meet him, and fee who and what he is, and whap
he has been doing ever fince he got leave to ab in -/
!
the high ftation he now appears in.
In the mean time, if I might obtain leave tg#
prefent an humble petition to Satan^ it fhould be&quot;,
that he would according to modern ufage oblige
us all, with writing the hiflory of bis own times j
twould,, as well as one that is
gone before it, be
a Deviliih good one &amp;gt;
for as to the fincerity of the
performance, the authority of the particulars, the
juftice of the characters, &V. if they were no bet
ter vouch d, no more confiftent with themfelves,
with charity, with truth, and with the honour of
an hiftorian, than the laft of that kind which
came abroad among us, it mud be a reproach to
the Devil himfelf to be the author of it.
Were Satan to be brought under the leaft ob
ligation to write truth, and that the matters of
fact, which he fhquld write, might be depended
upon, he is
certainly qualified by his knowledge
of things to be a compleat hiftorian 5 nor could
the Bimop himfelf, who, by the way, has given us
already the Devil of a hiftory^ come up to him :
Milton s
Pandemonium^ tho an excellent drama-
tick performance, would appear a meer trifling
iing-fong bufinefs, beneath the dignity of Chevy-
chafe : The Devil could give us a true account
cf all thje civil wars in Heaven j how and by
whom, and in what manner he loft the day there,
and was oblig d to quit the field : The fiction of
his refufing to acknowledge and fubmit to the
upon his being, declared Generaliffimo of

that fine-fpun thought of Mr. Milton would, ap
pear to be ftrain d too far, and only ferve to con
vince us that he (Milton) knew nothing of the mat
ter. Satan knows very well, that the Mejffiah was
not declared to be the Son of God with power till
by and after the refarreftion from the dead^ and
that all
power was then given him in Heaven and,
earth, and not before j io that Sat&quot;an s rebellion
inuft derive from other caufes, and upon other
.occafions, as he himfelf can doubtlefs give us an
account, if he thinks fit, and of which we ihall
fpeak further in this work.
What a fine Hifiory might this old Gentleman
write of the Antediluvian world, and of all the
weighty affairs, as well of flate as of religion*
which happen d during the fifteen hundred years
of the patriarchal adminiftration !
Who, like him, could give a full and compleat
account of the Deluge, whether it was a meet
vindictive, a blafl from Heaven, wrought by a
fupernatural power in the way of miracle? or
whether, according to Mr. Burners Theory^ it was
a confequence following antecedent caufes by the
meer neceffity of nature 5 feen in conftitution,
natural pofition, and unavoidable working of
things, as by the Theory publiih d by that learned
enthufrail it feems to be ?
Satan could eafily account for all the difficul
ties of the Theory^ and tell us whether, as there
was a natural neceffity of the Deluge, there is not
the like neceffity and natural tendency to a Con
flagration at laft.
Would the Devil exert himfelf as an Hiflorian,
for our improvement and diverfion, how glorious
an account could he give us of Noa/is Voyage
round
vfthe DEVIL. 13
routid the world, in the famous Ark! he could
refolve all the difficulties about the building it,
the furnifhing it, and the laying up provifionin it
for all the collection of kinds that he had made j
He could tell us whether all the creatures came
voluntier to him to go into the ark, or whether
he went a hunting for feveral years before, in or
der to bring them together.
He could give us a true relation how he wheed
led the people of the next world into the abfurd
ridiculous undertaking of building a Babel &amp;gt;
how
far that ftupendous flair-cafe, which was in ima
gination to reach up to Heaven, was carried, be
fore it was interrupted and the builders confoun
ded j how their fpeech was alter d, now many
Tongues it was divided into, or whether they
were divided at all &amp;gt;
and how many fubdivifions
or dialects have been made fince that, by which
means very few of God s creatures, except the
Brutes, underftand one another, or care one far
thing whether they do or no.
In all thefe things Satan^ who, no doubt, would
make a very good chronologift, could fettle
every
Epocha, correct every Calendar, and bring all our
accounts of time to a general agreement , as well
the Grecian Olympiads^ the lurkifb Hegbira^ the
Chinefe fictitious account of the world s duration,
as our blind Julian and Gregorian accounts, which
have put the world, to this day, into fuch confu-
fion, that we neither agree in our holy-days or
working days, fafts or feafts, nor keep the fame
fabbaths in any part of the fame globe.
This great Antiquary could bring us to a certain
ty in all the difficulties of ancient ilory, and tell
us whether the tale of the {iege of fro}9 and the
rape of Helen was a fable of Homer or a hi (lory &amp;gt;
whether the fictions of the Poets are form d from
their own brain, or founded in facts 3 and whe-
thar
U the HISTORY
ther letters were invented by Cadmus the Ph&ni-
dan^ or di&ated immediately from Heaven at mount
Sinai.
Nay, he could tell us how aiid in what manner
he wheedled Eve^ deluded Adam^ put Cain into a
paffion, till he made him murther his own bro
ther j and made Noah^ who was above foo years
a preacher of righteoufnefs, turn Sot in his old
age, dishonour all his miniftry, debauch himfelf
with wine, and by getting drunk and expofing
himfelf, become the jefl and laughing-ftock of
his children, and of all his poilerity to this day.
And would Satan, according to the modern
practice of the late right reverend Hiftorian, enter
into the characters of the great men of his age,
how fhould we be diverted with the juft hiftory
of Adam$ in paradife and out ofitj his character,
and how he behaved at and after his
expulfiorij how
Cain wandered in the land of Nod, what the
mark was which God fet
upon him, whole daugh
ter his wife was, and how big the city was he
built there, according to a certain Poet of noble
extraction,
How Cain in the land of Nod
When the rafcal was alone
Like an owl in an ivy tod
Built a city as big as Roan.

He could have certainly drawn Eve s
picture,
told us every feature in her face, and every inch
in her fhape, whether fhe was a perfect beauty or
no, and whether with the fall Ihe did grow crook
ed, ugly, ill-natur d and a fcold j as the learned
Valdemar fuggefts to be the effects of the curfe.
Defcending to the character of the Patriarchs
in that age, he might, no doubt, give us in par*
ticwlar
E tj
ticular the characters of Belus, worfhip d under
the name of Baal j with Satan, and Jupiter, his
iiiccefTors* who they were here, and how they be
haved 5 with all the Pharaohs of Egypt, the Abi~
milechs of Canaan, and the great monarchs of Af-
fyria arid Babylon.
Hence alfo he is able to write the lives of all
the Heroes of the world, from Alexander of Ma*
cedon to Lewis the XIV. and from Auguftus to the
great King George j nor could the Bifhop himfelf
go beyond him for flattery, any more than the
Devil himfelf could go beyond the Bifhop for
falfhood.
I could enlarge with a particular fatisfaction up
on the many fine things which Satan, rummaging
his inexhauflible ftorehoufe of flander, could fee
down to blacken the characters of good men, and
load the beft Princes of the world with infamy
and reproach.
But we fhall never prevail with him, I doubr^
to do mankind fo much fervice&amp;gt;
as refol ving all thofe
difficulties would be ; for he has an indelible grudge
againft us &amp;gt;
as he believes, and perhaps is afliir d that
men were at firft created by his fovereign, to the
intent that after a certain ftate of Probation in
life, fuch of them as fliall be approved, arc appoin
ted to fill
up thofe vacancies in the Heavenly Hoft,
which were made by the abdication and expulfion
of him (the Devil) and his Angels &amp;gt;
fo that man is
appointed to come in Satan s ftead^ to make good
the breach, and enjoy all thofe ineffable Joys and
Beatitudes which Satan enjoy d before his fall j
nowonder then, that the Devil fwells with envy
and rage at mankind in general,
and at the beft of
them in particular 5 nay, the granting this point is
giving an unanfwerable reafon, why the Devil prac-
tifes with fuch unwearied and indefatigable applica
tion upon the beft raenjifpoflible,to dilappoint
GOD
Almighty s
16 The HISTORY
Almighty s decree, and that he fhould not find
enough among the whole Race, to be proper fub-
}ec~bs
of his clemency, and qualified to fucceed the
~Devil and his hoft, or fill
up the places vacant by
the Fall. It is true indeed, the Devil^ who we
have reafon to fay is no fool, ought to know better
than to fuppofe that if he Aiould feduce the whole
race of mankind, and make them as bad as him-
(elf, he could, by that fuccefs of his wickednefs,
thwart or difappoint the determined purpofes
of Heaven j but that thofe which are appointed
to inherit the Thrones, which he and his fol
lowers abdicated, and were depofed from, fhall
certainly be preferv d in fpite of his Devices for
that inheritance, and {hall have the pofTeffion fe-
cur d to them, notwithftanding all that the
Dtvil and all the Hoft of Hell can do to pre
vent it.
But, however he knows the certainty of this,
and that when he endeavours the feducing thecho-
fen fervants of the moft High, he fights againft
GOD himfelf, ftruggles with irrefiftible grace, and
makes war with infinite power
-

fortified

the eternal promifes ofJefus Chrifr,
that the gates of Ifellj that is to fay, the Devil and
all his power, fhall not prevail againft them 3 I
fay, however he knows the impofilbility there is
that he fhould obtain his ends, yet ib blind is his
rage, fo infatuate his wifdom, that he cannot re
frain breaking himfelf to pieces againft this moun
tain, and fplitting againft the rock. qui Jupiter
&amp;lt;vult

But to leave this ferious part, which is a little
too folemn, for the account of this rebel 5 feeing
we are not to expect he will write his own Hi-
flory for our information and diverfion, I fhall fee
if I cannot write it for him : In order to this, I
fhall
of the D E VI L. 17
fhall extraft the fubftance of his whole (lory, from
the beginning to our own times, which 1 iliall col
let out of what is come to hand, whether by
revelation or infpiration, that s
nothing to him -
y
I fhall take care fo to improve my intelligence, as
may make my account of him authentick, and,
in a word, fuch as the Devil himfelf fhall not be
able to contradict
In writing this uncouth (lory I {hall be freed
from the cenfures of the Criticks, in a more than
ordinary manner, upon one account efpeciallyj
(viz. ) that my ftory fhall be fo juft and fo well
grounded, and, after all the good things I fhall
lay of Satan, will be fo little to his fatisfoclion, that
the Devil himfelf will not be able to fay, I dealt
with the Devil in writing it : I might, perhaps,
give you fome account where I had my intelli-
fence,andhowall
the Arcana of his
management
ave come to my hands 5 but pardon me, Gentle*
men, this would be to betray converfation, and to
difcovcr my agents, and you know ftatefmen are
very careful to preferve the correfpondences they
keep in the enemy s
country, left
they expoie
their friends to the refencment of the Power
whofe councils they betray.
Befides, the learned tell us, that minifters of ftate
make an excellent pica of their not betraying their
intelligence, againil all
party inquiries into the
great fums of money pretended to be paid for fe-
cret
fervice &amp;gt;
and whether the fecrct fervice was to
bribe
people to betray things abroad or at homej
whether the
money was paid to fome body or to no
body, employed to eftablim correfpondences abroad,
or to eftablifh families and amafs treafure at home&amp;gt;
in a
word, whether it was to ferve their country
orfervethemfelves,it has been the fame thing, and
the fame plea has been their protection: Like-
wile in the important affair which I am upon, tis
C hoped
is The HISTORY
hoped you will not defire me to betray my Corre-
fpondents 5 for you know Satan is
naturally cruel
and malicious, and who knows what he might do
to fhew his refentment? at lead it
might endanger
a flop of our intelligence for the future.
And yet, before I have done, I {hall make it
very plain, that however my information may be
feciet and difficult, that yet I came very honeftly
by it, and fhall make a very good ufe of it $ for
tis a great miftake in thofe who think that an ac
quaintance with the affairs of the Devil may not
be made very ufeful to us all :
They that know no
evil can know no good &amp;gt;
and, as the learned tell us,
that a flone taken out of the head of a Toad is a
good antidote againft poifonj fo a competent
knowledge oftke Devil, and all his ways, may be
the beft help to make us defie the Devil and all
his works.
CHAP. II.
Of the word DEVIL, as it is a proper name
to the Devil, and any or all his hoft&amp;gt;
An-
&c.
IT
is a queftion,not yet determined by the learned,
whether the word Z&amp;gt;m7bea/#0/r,thatisto
iay,the
name ofa perfon ftanding by himfelf,or &noun
of multitude ; if it be a fingular, and fo mull be ufed
perfonally only as a proper name^ it
confequently im
plies one imperial Devil^ Monarch or King of the
whole clan of Hell -
y juftly difHnguifh d by the
term THE DEVIL, or as the Scots call him, the
muckte
of the DEVIL; i$&amp;gt;
fnuckle horrid Deil^ or as others in a wilder dialect,
the Devil of Hell, that is to fay, the Devil of a
Devil-, or (better ftill) as the Scripture exprefles it,
by way of emphafis, the gredt red Dragon^ the
Devil and Satan.
But if we take this Word to be, as above, a
noun of multitude-) and fo to be u^dambo-dexter^ as
occafion prefents, fingular or plural &amp;gt;
then the Devil
fignifies Satan by himfelf, or Satan with all his
Legions at his heels, as you pleafe, more or lefs j and
this
way of understanding the word, as it
may be
very convenient for my purpofe, in the account I
am now to give of the infernal Powers, fo it is
not altogether improper in the nature of the
thing : It is thus exprefs d in Scripture, where the
perfon poflefs
d Matt. iv. 24. is firft faid to be
poflefs d of the Devil (fingular) and our Saviour
asks him, as fpcaking to a fingle perfon, what is
thy name ? and is anfwer d in the plural and fingular
together, my name is LEGION^ for we aYe many.
Nor will it be any wrong to the Devil^ fuppofing
him a fingle perfon, feeing entitling him to the con
duit of all his inferior Agents, is what he will take
rather for an addition to his infernal glory, than a
diminution or leflening of him in the extent of
his Fame.
Having thus articled with the Devil for liberty
of fpeech, I {hall talk of hirn fomctimes in the
fingular, as a perfon, and (bmetimes in the plural,
as an hoft of Devils or of infernal Spirits, juft as
occafion requires, and as the hiftory of his affairs
makes neceflary.
But before I enter upon any part of his hiftory,
the nature of the thing calls me back, and my Lord
B *
of in his late famous orations in de
fence of liberty, fummons me to prove that there
is fuch a thing or fuch a perfon as the Devil j and
in fliorc, unlefs I can give fome evidence of his

exiftence, as my Lord (aid very well, I am
talking of nobody.
D- m me. Sir, fays a gracelefs comrade of his
to a great man, your Grace will go to the Devil.
D m ye, Sir, fays the D ,
then I ihall
go
no where -
y I wonder where you intend to go ?
Nay, to the D / too I doubt, fays Gracelefs&amp;gt;
for I am almoft as wicked as my Lord Duke.
D. Thou ar t a filly empty Dog, fays the D ,
and if there is fuch a place as a Hell, tho I be
lieve nothing of it, tis a place for fools, fuch as
thou art.
Gr. I wonder then, what Heaven the great wits
go to, fuch as my Lord Duke &amp;gt;
I don t care to go
there, let it be where it will &amp;gt;
they are a tirefome
kind of people, there s no bearing them, they ll
make a Hell wherever they come.
D. Prithee hold thy fool s
tongue, I tell thee,
if there is
any fuch place as we call NO WHERE -
y
that s all the Heaven or Hell that I know of, or
believe any thing about.
Gr. Very good, my Lord- 5 fo that Heaven is no
where, and Hell is no where, and the Devil is nobody,
according to my Lord Duke !
D. Yes Sir, and what then?
Gr. And you are to go no where when you die,
are you ?
D. Yes, you Dog, don t
you know what that
incomparable noble genius my Lord Rochefter fings
upon the fubjecTr,
I believe it
unfeignedly,
fings.
After death nothing is,
And nothing death.
Gr. You believe it, my Lord, you mean, you
would fain believe it if you could j but fince you
put that great genius my Lord Rochefter upon me,
let me play him back upon your Grace; I am fure
you
of the DE VIE; 21
you have read his fine poem upon nothing^ in one
of the ftanzas of which is this beautiful thought,
And to be part of * thee
The wicked wifely pray.
D. You are a.foolifh Dog.
Gr. And my Lord Duke is a wife Infidel.
D. Why? is it not wifer to believe no Devil,
than to be always terrify d at him ?
Gr. But fhall I tofs another Poet upon you,
my Lord ?
If it fhould fo fall out, as who can tell
But there may be a GOD, a Heaven and Hell?
Mankind had beft confider well, for fear
T fhould be too late when their miftakes appear.
D. D m yourfoolifh Poet, that s not my Lord

Gr. But how muft I be damn d, if there s no De

My Lord Rocheftcr would not have faid that, and t

D. No,j 0# Dog, I am not inconfiftent at all, and
if I had the ordering of you, I d make you fen-
fible of it, I d make you think your felf damn d

Gr. That s like one of your Grace s
paradoxes,

22 The HISTORY
D. You are a critical Dog, who taught you to
believe tbefe folemn trifles? who taught you to
fay there is a GOD?
Gr. Nay, I had a better fchool-mafler than my
Lord Duke.
D. Why, who was your fchool-mafler pray ?
Gr. The Devil, and t
pleafe your Grace.
D. The Devil! the Devil he did? what you re
going to quote Scripture, are you ? Prithee don t
tell me of Scripture^ I know what you mean, the
Devils believe and tremble; why then I have the
\vhip-hand of the Devil, for I hate trembling $ and
I am delivered from it effectually, for I never
believed any thing of it, and therefore I don t
tremble.
Gr. And there, indeed, I am a wickeder crea
ture than the Devil^ or even than my Lord Duke^
for I believe, and yet don t tremble neither.
D. Nay, if you are come to your penitentials I
have done with you.
Gr. And 1 think I muft have done with my Lord
Duke^ for the fame reafon.
D. ^y^ ay^ pray do, I ll
go and enjoy my felfj
I won t throw away the pleaiure of my life, I
Jcnow the confequence of it.
Gr. And I ll
go and reform my felf, elfe I know
the confequence too.
This ihort Dialogue happen d between two
men of quality, and both men of wit too $ and
the effect was, that the Lord brought the reality of
the Devil into the queftion, and the debate brought
the
profligate
to be a penitent &amp;gt;
fo in fliort, the
Devil was made a preacher of repentance.
The Truth is, God and the Devil, however op-
pofite ii} thejr nature, and remote from one ano
ther in their place of abiding, feem to ftand
pret
ty much upon a level in our faith : For as to our
Relieving the reality
of |heir exiftence, he that
ofthe DEVIL; 25
denies one, generally denies both ; and he that be
lieves one, neceflarily believes both.
Very few, if any of thofe who believe there is a
GOD, and acknowledge the debt of homage which
mankind owes to the fupreme Governor of the
World, doubt the exiftence of the Devil, except
here and there one,whom we call practical Atheifts -,
and tis the character of an Atheift, if there is fuch
a creature on Earth, that like my Lord Duke^ he
believes neither GOD or Devil.
As the belief of both thefe (lands upon a level,
and that GOD and the Devil feem to have an
equal {hare in our faith, fo the evidence of their
exiftence feems to ftand upon a level too&amp;gt;
in many
things j and as they are known by their Works
in the fame particular cafes, fo they are difcover d
after the fame manner of demonftration.
Nay, in fome refpe&s tis
equally criminal to
deny the reality of them both, only with this
difference, that to believe the exiftence of a GOD
is a debt to nature, and to believe the exiftence of
the Devil is a like debt to reafon j one is a demon
ftration from the reality of vifible cauies, and the
other a deduction from the like reality of their
effets.
One demonftration of the exiftence of GOD,
is from the univcrfal well-guided confent of all
nations to worfliip and adore a fupreme Power ;
One demonftration of the exiftence of the Devil^
is from the avow d ill-guided confent of fome na
tions, who knowing no other GOD, make a GOD
of the Devil, for want of a better.
It may be true, that thofe nations have no other
Ideas of the Devil than as of a fuperior Power $ if
they thought him a fupreme Power it would have
other effects on them, and they would fubmit to
and worfhip him with a different kind of fear.
C 4 But
24 T^HSITORY
But tis
plain they have right notions of him as a
Devil or evil
Spirit, becaufe the beft reafon, and in
ibme places the only reafon they give for worfhip-
ing him is, that he may do them no hurt 3 having
no notions at all of his having any power, much
lefs
any inclination to do them good $ fo that in
deed they make a meer Devil of him, at the fame
time that they bow| to him as to a GOD.
All the ages of Paganifm in the World have
had this notion of the Devil: indeed in fome parts
of the World they had alfo fome Deities which
they honoured above him, as
being fuppofed to be
beneficent, kind and inclin d, as well as capable
to give them good things &amp;gt;
for this reafon the
more polite Heathens, fuch as the Grecians and
the Romans, had their Lares or houfhold Gods,
whom they paid a particular refpect to j as being
their Protectors from Hobgoblins, Ghofls of the
Dead, evil jSpirits, frightful Appearances, evil Ge
nius s and other noxious Beings from the invi-
fible World 5 or to put it into the language of
the day we live in, from the Devil, in whatever
fhape or appearance he might come to them, and
from whatever might hurt them : and what was all
this but fetting up Devils againft Devils, fupplica-
ting one Devil under the notion of a good Spirit,
to drive out and protect them from another, whom
they calFd a bad Spirit, the white Devil againft
the black Devil?
This proceeds from the natural notions man
kind neceflarily entertain of things to come; fupe*
rior or inferior, GOD and the Devil, fill
up all fu
turity in our thoughts ^ and tis
impoflible for us
to form any images in our minds of an immor
tality and an invifible World, but under the no
tions of perfect felicity, or extreme mifery.
Now as thefe two refpect the Eternal ftate
of man after life, they are refpeftively the object
of the DEVIL #
of our reverence and affection, or of our horror and
averfionj but notwith {landing they are plac d thus
in a diametrical opposition in our affections and
paffions, they are on an evident level as to the cer
tainty of their exiftence, and, as I faid above, bear
an equal {hare in our faith.
It being then as certain that there is a Devil, as
that there is a GW, I mud from this time forward
admit no more doubt of his exiftence, nor take
any more pains to convince you of it 5 but {peak
ing of him as a reality in Being, proceed to enquire
who he is, and from whence, in order to enter
directly into the detail of his Hiftory.
Now not to enter into all the metaphyfical trum
pery of his Schools, nor wholly to confine my
felf to the language of the Pulpit ; where we are
told, that to think of GOD and of the Z)m7, we
muft endeavour firft to form Ideas of thofe things
which illuftrate the defcription of rewards and
punifhments &amp;gt;
in the one the eternal prefence of
the higheft good, and, as a neceflary attendant, the
moft perfect, confummate, durable blifs and felicity,
fpringing from the prefence of that Being in whom
all
poffible Beatitude is
inexpreflibly prefent, and
that in the higheft perfection : On the contra
ry, to conceive of a fublime fallen Arch-angel,
attended with an innumerable hoft of degenerate,
rebel Seraphs or Angels caftout of Heaven toge
ther -
y all
guilty of inexpreffible rebellion, and all
fuffering from that time, and to fuffer for ever
the eternal vengeance of the Almighty, in an in
conceivable manner ; that his prefence, tho blefled
in it felf, is to them the moft compleat article of ter
ror 9 That they are in themfelves perfectly miferablej
and to be with whom for ever, adds an inex-
preffible mifery to any ftate as well as
place j and
fills the minds of thofe who are to be, or expect to
be
26 The HIS TORY
be banifh d to them with inconceivable horror and
amazement.
But when you have gone over all this, and a
great deal more of the like, tho lefs intelligible
language, which the paffions of men colled to
amufe one another with ; you have faid nothing
if you omit the main article, namely, the perfonality
of the Devil y and till
you add to all the reft fome
defcription of the company with whom all this is
to be fuffer d, viz. the Devil and his Angels.
Now who this Devil and his Angels are, what
ihare they have either
actively
or paffively in the
eternal miferies of a future ftate, how far they
are Agents in or Partners with the fufferings of
the place, is a difficulty yet not fully difcover d
by the moft learned j nor do I believe tis made
lefs a difficulty by their medling with it.
But to come to the perfon and original of the
Devi^ or, as I faid before, of Devils j I allow him
to come of an ancient family, for he is from Hea
ven, and more truly than the Romans could fay
of their idoliz d Numa, he is of the race of the
Gods.
That Satan is a fallen Angel, a rebel Seraph,
caft out for his Rebellion, is the general opini
on, and tis not my bufinefs to difpute things uni-
verfally receiv d ; as he was try d, condemn d, and
the fentence of expulfion executed on him in
Heaven, he is in this World like
atranfportcd Fe
lon never to return; His crime, whatever par
ticular aggravations it might have, tis certain,
amounted to High-treafon againft his Lord and Go
vernor, who wasalfo his Maker j againft whom
he rofe in rebellion, took up arms, and in a word,
rais d a horrid and unnatural war in his domini
ons ; but being overcome in battle, and made pri-
r^ f^ ancj an jjj$ Hoft, whofe numbers were
infinite*
of the DEVIL; 27
infinite, all
glorious Angels like himfelf, loft at
once their beauty and glory with their Innocence,
and commenc d Devils^ being transform d by crime
into monfters and frightful objects &amp;gt;
fuch as to
defcribe, human fancy is
obliged to draw piftures
and defcriptions in fuch forms as are moft hateful
and frightful to the imagination.
Thele notions, I doubt not, gave birth to all the
beauteous Images and fublime expreflions in Mr.
Milton s
majeftick Poem &amp;gt; where, tho he has play d
the Poet in a moil luxuriant manner, he has finn d a-
gain ft Satan moft
egregioufly, and done the Devil
a manifeft injury in a great many particulars, as I
fhall {hew in its
place. And as I fhall be oblig d
to do Satan juftice when I come to that part of
his Hiftory, Mr. Milton s admirers muft pardon me,
if I let them fee, that tho I admire Mr. Milton as
a Poet, yet that he was greatly out in matters of
Hiftory, and efpecially the Hiftory of the Devil$
in fhort, That he has charged Satan falfly in fe-
veral particulars ; and fo he has Adam and Eve
too : But that I lhall leave till I come to the Hi
ftory of the Royal Family of Eden\ which I re-
folve to prefent you with when the Devil and I
have done with one another.
But not to run down Mr. Milton neither, whofe
poetry, or his judgment, cannot be reproached
without injury to our own j all thofe bright Ideas
of his, which make his poem fo juftly valued,
whether they are capable of proof as to the fact,
are
notwithstanding, confirmations of my hypo-
thefis i and are taken from a fuppofition of the
Perfonality of the Devil^ placing him at the
head of the infernal hoft, as a fovereign ele
vated Spirit and Monarch of Hell &amp;gt;
and as fuch it i$
that I undertake to write his hiftory.
By the word Hell I do not fuppofe, or at leaft
Hot determine, that his residence, or that of the
whole
*s The HISTORY
whole army of Devils, is
yet in the fame local
HELL, to which the Divines tell us he fliall be
at lad chain ddovvn j or at lead that he is
yet con-
fin d to it, for we fhall find he is
atprefenta pri-
foner at large: of both which circumfiances
of Satan I fhall take occafion to fpeak in its
courfe?
But when I call the Devil the Monarch of /&//,
I am to be underftood as fuits to the prefent pur-
pofe; that he is the Sovereign of all the race of
Hell, that is to fay of all the Devils or Spirits of
the infernal Clan, let their numbers, quality and
powers be what they will.
Upon this fuppofed peribnality and fuperiority
of Satan^ or, as I call it, the fovereignty and go
vernment of one Devil above all the reft -
y I fay,
upon this notion are form d all the fyftems of the
dark fide of futurity, that we can form in our minds :
And fo general is the opinion of it, that it will
hardly bear to be oppos d by any other argument,
at leaft that will bear to be reafon d upon : All
the notions of a parity of Devils, or making 3
common-wealth among the black Divan, feem to
be enthufiaftick and vifionary, but with no con-
fiftency or certainty, and is fo generally exploded,
that we muft not venture fo much as to debate
the point.
Taking it then as the generality of mankind
do, that there is a Grand Devil, a fuperiorof the
whole black race j that they all fell, together with
their General, Satan^ at the head of them 5 that
tho he, Sat&n^ could not maintain his high fta-
don in Heaven, yet that he did continue his dig
nity among the reft, who are call d his fervants,
in Scripture his dngeh &amp;gt;
that he has a kind of do
minion or authority over the reft, and that they
were all, how many million^ foever in number, at
his command &amp;gt;
employ d by him in all his hellifh
defigns.
of the DEVIL. *&amp;lt;&amp;gt;
defigns,
and in all his wicked contrivances for the
deftru&ion of man, and for the fetting up his own
kingdom in the world.
Suppofing then that there is fuch a iuperior
Mafter-Devil over all the reft, it remains that we
enquire into his chara&er, and fomething of his
Hiftory j in which, tho we cannot perhaps pro
duce fuch authentick documents as in the ftory of
other great Monarchs, Tyrants, and Furies of the
World &amp;gt;
yet I ihall endeavour to fpeak fome things
which the experience of mankind may be apt to
confirm, and which the Devil hirnfelf will hardly
be able to contradict.
It being then granted that there is fuch a thing
or perfon, call him which we will, as a Mafter-
Devil i that he is thus fuperior to all the reft in
power and in authority, and that all the other evil
Spirits are his Angels, or Minifters, or Officers to
execute his commands, and are employ d in his
bufinefs 5 it remains to enquire, whence he came?
how he got hither, into this World ? what that
bufinefs is which he is
employ d about? what
his prefent ftate is, and where and to what part
of the creation of God he is limited and rcftrained ?
what the liberties are he takes or is allow d to
take? in what manner he works, and how his in-
ftrumcnts arc likewife allow d to work ? what he
has done ever fince he commenc d Devil, what
he is now doing, and what he may yet do before
his J,aft and clofer confinement? as alfo what he
can/iot do, and how far we may or may not be
(aid to be cxpofed to him, or have or have not
reaibn to be afraid of him? Thefe, and whatever
elfe occurs in the Hiftory and conduct of this
Arch-devil and his Agents, that may be ufeful for
information, caution, or diverfion, you may ex

50 The HI STORY
I know it has been queftion d by fome, with
more face than fear, how it confifts with a com-1
pleat vi&ory of the Devil, which they fay was
at firft obtained by the Heavenly Powers over
Satan and his apoftate army in Heaven, that when
he was caft out of his holy place, and daih d down
into the abyfs of eternal darknefs, as into a place
of punifhment, a condemned hold, or place ofcon
finement, to be referved there to the judgment of
the great Day &amp;gt;
Ifay^
how it confifts with that
entire victory, to let him loofe again, and give him
liberty, like a thief that has broken prifon, to
range about God s creation, and there to continue
his rebellion, commit new ravages, and acts of
hoftility againft God, make new efforts at de-^
throning the almighty Creator -
y and in particular
to fall
upon the weakefl of his creatures, MAN?
how Satan being fo entirely vanquifh d, he fhould
be permitted to recover any of his wicked powers,
and find room to do mifchief to mankind.
Nay they go farther, and fuggeft bold things
againft the wifdom of Heaven, in expofing man
kind, weak in comparifon of the immenfe extent
of the DeviVs power, to fomanifeft an overthrow,
to fo unequal a fight, in which he is
fure, if alone
in the conflict, to be worfted &amp;gt;
to leave him fuch
a dreadful enemy to engage with, and fo ill fur-
nifh d with weapons to aflift hiro.
Thefe objections I fhall give as
good an an-
fwer to as the cafe will admit in this courfe, but
muft adjourn them for the prefent.
That the Devil is not yet a clofe prifoner, we
have evidence enough to confirm $ I will not
fuggeft, that like our Newgate Thieves, (to bring
little Devils and great Devils together) he is let
out by connivance, and has fome little latitudes
and advantages for mifchief, by that means &amp;gt;
return*
ing at certain fcafons to his confinement again.
This
of the DEVIL: ?
t
This might hold, were it not, that the companion
muft fuggeft, that the power which has caft him
down could be deluded, and the under-keepers or
jaylors,
under whofe charge he was in cuftody,
could wink at his excurfions, and the Lord of the
place know nothing of the matter. But this wants
farther explanation.
CHAP. III.
Of the original of the DEVIL, who he isl
and what be was before his expulfion out
of Heaven, and in whatflate he wasfrom
that time to the creation of Man.
TO
come to a regular enquiry into Satan s
affairs, tis needful we fliould go back to his
original, as far as hiftory and the opinion of the
learned World will give us leave.
It is
screed by all Writers, as well facred aspro-
phane, that this creature we now call a Devil,
was originally an Angel oflight, a glorious Seraph 5
perhaps the choiceft of all the glorious Seraphs.
See how Milton defcribes his original glory :
Satan, fo call him now, his former name
Is heard no more in Heaven : He of the firft,
If not the fir
ft Archangel -,
great in power,
In favour and preeminence.

fubjeft :

lib. vii. fol. i8p.
The glorious figure which Satan is
fuppofed to
make among the Thrones and Dominions in Hea
ven is fuch, as we might fuppofe the highefl An
gel in that exalted train could make ; and fome
think, as above^ that he was the chief of the
Arch-angels.
Hence that notion, (and not ill founded) namely ,
that the firft caufe of his difgrace, and on which
enfued his rebellion, was occafioned upon God s
proclaiming his SON Generaliflimo ,
and with
himfelf fupreme ruler in heaven 3 giving the do
minion of all his works of creation, as well al
ready finifh d, as not then begun, to him j which
poft of honour (fay they) Satan expefted to be
conferr d on himfelf, as next in honour, majefty
and power to God the Supreme.
This opinion is foliow d by Mr. Milton too, as
appears in the following lines, where he makes
all the Angels attending all a general fummons,
and God the Father making the following de
claration to them.

himfelf at that time, faying, This day have I be

(as above) was the Chier^ and expe&ing, if

But Mr. Milton is
grofly erroneous inafcribing
thofe words, This day have Ibegotten thee^ to that de
claration of the Father before Satan fell, and confe-
quently to a time before the creation , whereas,

In a word, Satan withdrew with all his followers
malecontent and chagrine, refolv d to diibbey
this new command, and not yield obedience to
the Son.
But Mr. Milton agrees in that opinion, that the
number of Angels which rebel d with Satan was
infinite, and fuggefts in one place, that they were
the greateft half of all the angelick Body or fera-
phick Hoft.

CHAP. IV.
Of the name of the &amp;lt;Dw/7, his original, and
the nature of his circumftances Jince he
has been called by that name.
THE Scripture is the firft
writing on earth
where we find the Devil called by his own
proper diftinguifhing denomination, DEVIL,
of the D E V I L. 39
or the *
Deftroyer-y nor indeed is there any other
author of antiquity or of fufficient authority which
fays any thing of that kind about him.
Here he makes his firft appearance in the world,
and on that occaflon he is called the Serpent ; but
the Serpent however fince made to fignify the
Devil) when fpoken of in general terms, was but
the Devil s
reprefentative, or the Devil in quo vzs
vehicuh) for that time, clothed in a bodily fhape,
acting under cover and in difguife,
or if you will
the Devil in mafquerade :
Nay, if we believe
Mr. Milton) the Angel Gabriel s
fpear had fuch
a fecret powerful influence, as to make him (trip
ofa fudden, and with a touch to unmask, and fhnd
upright in his naked original fhape, mser Devil)
without any difguifes whatfoever.
Now as we go to the Scripture for much
of his hiftory, fo we muft go there alfo for fome of
his names j and he has a great variety of names in
deed, as his feveral mifchievous doings guide us to
conceive of him. The truth is, all the anrient
names given him, of which the Scripture is full,
feems to be originals derived from and adapted to
the feveral fteps he has taken, and the feveral
fhapes he has appeared in to do mifchief in the
world.

But to fum them all
up in one, he is called in
the new Teftament^/0* DEVIL j all his other names
are varied according to the cuitoin of fpeech, and
the dialecls of the ieveral nations where he is
Ipoken
of 3 But in a word, Devil is the common name
of the Devil in all the known languages of the
earth.
Nay, all the mifchiefs he is
empowered
Co do, are in Scripture placed to his account, un
der the particular title of the Devil^ not of Devils
in the plural number, though they are fometimes
mentioned too j but in the lingular it is the iden
tical individual Devil, in and under whom all the
little Devils, and all the great Devils, if fuch there
be, are fuppofed to act 5 nay, they are fuppofed
to be governed and d.ire&ed by him. Thus we are
told in Scripture of the works of the Devil, i

rcfifting the Devil, fames iv. f. of our Saviour
being tempted of the Devil, Mat. iv. 1 . of Si
mon Magus, a child of the Devil, Acbs xiii. 10.
The Devil came down in a great wrath. Rev. xii.
of the DEVIL: 4?
12. and the like. According to thisufage in fpeech
we go on to this day, and all the infernal
things
\ve converfe with in the world, are fathered upon
the Devil
r
,
as one undivided fimple effence, by
how many agents foever working :
Every thing
evil, frightful in appearance, wicked in its
actings,
horrible in its manner, monftrous in its
effects,
is called the Devil; in a word, Devil is the com
mon name for all Devils j that is to (ay, for all
evil Spirits, all evil Powers, all evil Works, and
even all evil things : Yet tis remarkable the
Devil is no old Teftament word, and we never
find it ufed in all that part of the Bible but four
times, and then not once in the fingular number, and
not once to fignify Satan as tis now underftood.
It is true, the Learned give a
great many differ
ing interpretations of the word Devil ; the Eng-
lijh Commentators tell us, it means a deftroyer,
others that it
fignifies a deceiver, and the Greeks
derive it from a Calumniator or falfe witnefs j for we
find that Calumny was a Goddefs^ to whom the
Athenians built altars and offer d facrifices upon
fome folemn occafions, and they call her Aia/Bo^rj
from whence came the mafculine Aidfiohos which
we translate Devil.
Thus we take the name of Devil to fignify not
perfons only, but actions and habits 5 making ima
ginary Devils, and transforming that fubflantial
creature call d DEVIL into every thing noxious
and offenfive : Thus St. Francis being tempted
by the Devil in the fhape of a bag of money lying
in the highway, the Saint having difcover d the
fraud, whether feeing his Cloven-foot hang out
of the purfe, or whether he diftinguifh d him by
his fmell of fulphur* or how otherwile, authors arc
not agreed ; but, I fay, the Saint having difco
ver d the cheat, and out-witted the Devilj took
occafion to preach that eminent fermon to his
difciples,
42, The H I S T O R Y
difciples, where his Text was, Money is THE
DEVIL.
Nor, upon the whole, is
any wrong done to the
Devil by this kind of treatment, it
only gives
him the fovereignty of the whole army of Hell,
and making ail the numberlefs legions of the bot-
tomlefs pit lervants j or, as the Scripture calls them,
Angels to Satan the grand Devil &amp;gt;
all their ac
tions, performances and atchievements are juftly
attributed to him, not as the prince of Devils only,
but the Emperor of Devils -,
the prince of all
the princes of Devils.
Under this denomination then of DEVIL, all the
Powers of Hell, all the Princes of the air, all the
black armies of Satan are comprehended, and in
fuch manner they are to be underilood in this whole
work ; mutatis mutandi^ accoiding to the feveral
circurn fiances of which we are to ipeak of them.
This being premised, and rny authority being fo
good, Satan muil not take it ill, if I treat him
after the manner of men, and give him thofe titles
which he is belt known by among us &amp;gt;
for indeed
having fo
many, tis not very eafy to call him out
of his name.
However, as I am oblig d by the duty of an
Hiflorian to decency as well as impartiality, fo I
thought it
neceffary, before I ufed too much free
dom with Satart) to produce authentick Docu
ments, and bring antiquity upon the ibge, to jufti-
fy the manner of my writing, and let
you fee I
iliall defcribe him in no colours, nor call him by
any name, but what he has been known by for
many ages before me.
And now, though writing to the common
under{binding of my Readers, I am oblig d to
treat Satan very coarily, and to fpeak of him in
the common acceptation, calling him plain Devil^
a word which in this mannerly age is not fo.fono-
rous
of the &quot;DEVI L: 4j
rous as others might be, and which by the error
of the Times is
apt to prejudice us againft his Per-
fonj yet it muft be acknowledg d he has a great
many other names and firnames which he might
be known by, of a lefs obnoxious import than
that of Devil) or Deflroyer, 8tc.
Mr. Milton* indeed, wanting titles of honour
to give to the Leaders of Satan s
Holt, is
oblig d to
borrow feveral of his Scripture names, and beflow
them upon his infernal Heroes, whom he makes
the Generals and Leaders of the armies of Hell &amp;gt;
and fo he makes Beelzebub, Lucifer, Belial, Mam
mon, and fome others, to be the names of parti
cular Devils, members of Satan s upper houfe or
Pandemonium \ whereas indeed, thefe are all names
proper and peculiar to Satan himfelf.
The Scripture alfo has fome names of a coar-
fer kind, by which the Devil is
underftood, as
particularly, which is noted already, in the Apoca-
lypfe he is call d the Great Red Dragon, \hzBeafl,
the Old Serpent, and the like : But take it in the
Scripture, or where you will in
Hiflory facred or
prophane, you will find that in general the De
vil is,
as I have faid above, his ordinary name in
all languages and in all nations &amp;gt;
the name by which
he and his works are principally diftinguifli d : Alfa
the Scripture, befides that it often gives him
this name, fpeaks of the works of the Devil^
of the fubtilty of the Devil, of cafting out De
vils, of being tempted of the Devil, of being pof?
(efs d with a Devil, and fo many other expreffions
of that kind, as I have faid already, are made ufe
of for us to underftand the evil Spirit by, that in a
word. Devil is the common name of all wicked
Spirits: For Satan is no more the Devil, as if
he alone was fo, and all the reft were a diminutive
fpecies who did not go by that name&amp;gt; But, I
fay,
even in Scripture, every Spirit, whether under his
Domi-
44 The HIS TORY
Dominion or out of his Dominion, is called the
Devil, and is as much a real Devil, that is to fay,
a condemned Spirit, and employ d in the fame
wicked work as Satan himfelf.
His Name then being thus afcertain d, and hk
Exiftence acknowledged, it fhould be a little en-
quir d what be is ; we believe there is fuch a
thing,
fuch a creature as the Devil, and that he has
been, and may Hill with propriety of fpeech, and
without injuflice to his Character be call d by his
antient name Devil.
But who is he ? what is his
original ? whence
came he ? and what is his prefent ftation and con
dition? for thefe things and thefe enquiries are
very neceflciry to his Hiftory, nor indeed can any
part of his Hiiiory be compleat without them.
That he is of an antient and noble original muft
be acknowledged, for he is
Heaven-born, and
of Angelic Race, as has been touch d already : If
Scripture-evidence may be of any weight in the
queftion, there is no room to doubt the genealogy
of the Devil; he is not only fpoken of as an An
gel^
but as a fallen Angel\ one that had been in
Heaven, had beheld the face of GOD in his full
effulgence of glory, and had furrounded the
Throne of the mod High j from whence, com
mencing rebel and being expell d, he was caft
down, down, down, GOD and the Devil himfelf
only knows where $ for indeed we cannot fay that
any man on Earth knows it j and wherever it
is,
he has ever fince man s creation been a plague to
him, been a tempter, a deluder, a calumniator,
an enemy and the objecl: of man s horror and a-
verfion.
As his original is Heaven-born^ and his Race
Angelic, fo the Angelic nature is
evidently plac d
in a clafs fupcrior to the human, and this the Scrip
ture is exprefs in alfp 3 when fpeaking of man,
it
*fthe DEVIL; 4.5
it fays,
he made him a little lower than the An
gels.
Thus the Devil, as mean thoughts as you may
have of him, is of a better family than any of
you, nay than the beft Gentleman of you allj
what he may be fallen to, is one thing^ but what
he is fallen from, is another, and therefore I mud
tell my learned and reverend friend J. W. LL. D.
when he fpoke fo rudely of the Devil lately. That
in my opinion he abus d his Betters.
Nor is the Scripture more a help to us in the
fearch after the Devil s
Original, than it is in our
fearch after his Nature : it is true, Authors are
not agreed about his age, what time he was crea
ted, how many years he enjoy d his (late of blef-
fednefs before he fell j or how many years he con
tinued with his whole army in a ftate ofdarknefs,and
before the creation of man. Tisfuppofed it
might
be a confiderable fpace, and that it was a part of
his punifhment too, being all the while una&ive, un-
employ d, having no bufinefs, nothing to do but
gnawing his own Bowels, and rolling in the ago
ny of his own felf-approaches, being a Hell to
himfelf in reflecting on the glorious ftate from
whence he was fallen.
How long he remained thus, tis true, we have
no light into from Hiftory, and but little from Tra
dition 5 Rabbi Judah fays, the Jews were of the
opinion, that he remained twenty thoufand years
in that condition, and that the World {hall con
tinue twenty thoufand more, in which he {hall
find work enough to fatisfy his mifchievous de-
fires ; but he fhews no authority for his opi
nion.
Indeed let the Devil have been as idle as
they
think he was before, it muft be acknowledged that
now he is the moil bufy, vigilant and diligent,
of all
GOD S
46 The HIST O RY
GOD S creatures, and very full of employment too?
fitch as it is.
Scripture indeed, gives us light into the en
mity there is between the two natures, the Dia
bolical and the Human 5 the reafon of it, and how
and by what means the power of the Devil is re
train d by the Mejffias , and to thofe who are wil
ling to truft to Gofpel-light, and believe what the
Scripture fays of the Devil^ there may much of
his Hiftory be difcover d, and therefore thofe
that lift
may go there for a fuller account of the
matter.
But to referve all Scripture-evidence of thefe
things, as a Magazine in ftore for the ufe of thofe
\vith whom Scripture- teftimony is of force, I mult
for the prefent turn to other enquiries, being now
directing my flory to an age, wherein to be driven
to Revelation and Scripture-afTertions is efleem d
fiving
up the difputej people now-a-days muft
ave demonftration $ and in a word, nothing will
fatisfy the age, but fuch evidence as
perhaps the na
ture of the queftion will not admit.
It is hard, indeed, to bring demonftrations in
fuch a cafe as this: No man has feen GOD at any
time, fays the fcripture, i
John iv. 12,. So the
Devil being a fpirit incorporeal, an Angel of
light, and confequently not vifible in his own
fubftance, nature and form, it
may in fome fenfe
be faid, no man has feen the Devil at any time 5 all
thofe pretences of phrenziful and fanciful people,
who tell us, they have feen the Devil9 I {hall ex
amine, and perhaps expofe by themfelves.
It
might take up a great deal of our time here,
to enquire whether the Devil has any particular
fhape or perfonality of fubftance, which can be
vifible to us, felt, heard, or underftood &amp;gt;
and which
he cannot alter, and then, what fhapes or appear
ances the Devil has at any time taken upon him ;
i and
of the DEVIL; 4 ?
and whether he can really appear in a body which
might be handled and feen, and yet fo as to know
it to have been the Demi at the time of his ap
pearing 5 but this alfo I defer as not of weight in
the prefent enquiry.
We have divers accounts of Witches conver
ging with /^? Devil; the Devil in a real body, with
all the appearance of a body of a man or wo
man appearing to them &amp;gt;
alfo of having a Familiar,
as they call it, an Incubus or little Devil, which
fucks their bodies, runs away with them into the
air, and the like : Much of this is faid, but much
more than it is
eafy to prove, and we ought
to give but a juft proportion of credit to thofe
things.
As to his borrow d fhapes and his fubtle tranf-
formings, that we have fuch open tefttmony of^
that there is no room for any queftion about it &amp;gt;
and when I come to that part, I fhall be obliged
rather to give a hiftory of the fact, than enter
into any difTertation upon the nature and reafon
of it.
I do not find in any author, whom we can call
creditable, that even in thofe countries where the
dominion of Satan is more particularly eftablifh d,
and where they may be faid to worfhip him in a
more particular manner, as a Devil &amp;gt;
which fome
tell us the Indians in America, did, who worihip d
the Devil that he might not hurt them j yet, Ijay9
I do not find that even there the Devil appear d to
them in any particular conilant fhape or perfona-
lity peculiar to himfelf.
Scripture and Hiftory therefore, giving us no
light into that part of the queftion, I conclude and
Jay it down, not as my opinion only, but as what
all
ages feem to concur in, that the Devil has no
Particular
body 5 that he is a fpirit,
and that tho*
e may, Proteus like, aflumc the appearance of
either
4 S The HI STORY
either man or beaft, yet it muft be fome borrowed
fhape, fome aflum d figure, pro hac vice, and that
he has no vifible body of his own.
I thought it needful to difcufs this as a prelimi
nary, and that the next difcourfe might go upon
a certainty in this grand point ; namely, that the
Devil, however, he may for his particular occafions
put himfelfinto a great many fhapes,and clothe him
felf, perhaps, with what appearances he pleafes,
yet that he is himfelf ftill ameer Spirit, that he re
tains the feraphic Nature, is not vifible by our eyes,
which are human and Organic, neither can he
act with the ordinary Powers, or in the ordinary
manner as bodies do j and therefore, when he has
thought fit to defcend to the meannefles of di-
Curbing and frightning children and old women,
by noifes and knockings, diflocating the chairs
and flools, breaking windows, and fuch like little
ambulatory things, which would feem to be below
the dignity of his character, and which in
parti
cular, is
ordinarily performed by organic Powers 5
yet even then he has thought fit not to be/een,
and rather to make the poor people believe he had
a real fhape and body, with hands to act, mouth
to fpeak, and the like^ than to give proof of it in
common to the whole World, by mewing him
felf, and acting vifibly and openly, as a body ufu-
ally and ordinarily does.
Nor is it any difadvantage to the Devil, that his
Seraphic nature is not confined or impriibn d in a
body or fhape, fuppofe that fhape to be what
monftrous thing we would j for this would, indeed,
confine his actings within the narrow fphere of the
organ or body to which he was limited j and tho*
you were to fuppofe the body to have wings for
a velocity of Motion equal to fpirir, yet if it
had not a power ofinvifibility too, and a capacity
of conveying it felfj undifcovcr d, into all the fe-
crct
of the DEVI L. 49
cretrecefles of mankind, and the fame fecretarto^
capacity
of infinuation, fuggeftion, accusation, &V.
by which his wicked defigns are now propagated,
and all his other devices affifted, by which he de
ludes and betrays mankind $ I fay,
he would be no
more a Devil, that is a Dcftroyer, no more a De
ceiver, and, no more a Satan, that is, a dangerous
Arch enemy to the fouls of men &amp;gt;
nor would it be
any difficulty to mankind to ihun and avoid him,
as I fhall make plain in the other part of his Hi-
ftory.
Had the Devil from the beginning been embodi
ed, as he could not have been invifible to us, whole
fouls
equally feraphic are only prefcrib d by being
embody d and encas d in fleih and blood as we are j
fo he would have been no more a Devil to any
body but hirnfelf: Theimprifonmentina body, had
the powers of that body been all that we can con
ceive to make him formidable to us, would yet have
been a Hell to him 5 confidjer him as a conquer d
cxafperated Rebel, retaining all that fury and fwel-
ling ambition, that hatred of God, and envy at his
creatures which dwells now in his
enrag d fpifit
as
a Devil: yet fuppofe him to have been condemn d
to organic Powers, confin d to corporeal motion,
and reftrain d as a Body muft be fuppofed to re-
ftrain a Spirit; it muft, at the fame time, fuppofe
him to be effectually diiabled from all the me
thods he is now allow d to makeufe of, for exert
ing his rage and enmity againft God, any farther
than as he might fuppofe it to afFeft his Maker at
fecond hand, by wounding his Glory thro the
fides of his weakeft creature, MAN.
He muft, certainly, be thus confin d, becaufe
Body can only act upon Body, not upon Spirit ; no
fpecies being empower d to aft out of the com-
pafs of its own fphere: He might have been em
power d, indeed, to have a&ed terrible and even de-
E flruftive
50 The HISTORY
ftru6Hve things upon mankind, efpecially if this
body had any powers given it which mankind had
not, by which man would be overmatch d and
not be in a condition of felf-defence 3 for exam
ple, fuppofe him to have had wings to have flown
in the air j Or to be invulnerable, and that no human
invention, art, or engine could hurt, erifnare, capti
vate, or reftrain him.
But this is to fuppofe the righteous and wife
Creator to have made a creature and not be able
to defend and prefcrve him &amp;gt;
or to have left him de-
fencclefs to the mercy of another of his own
creatures, whom he had given power to deftroy
him j This indeed, might have occaiion d a gene
ral idolatry, and made mankind, as the Americans
do to this day, worfhip the D&vil^ that he might
not hurt them , but it could not have prevented
the deftruftion of mankind, fuppofing the Devil
to have had malice equal to his power: and he
mult put on a new nature, be compaffionate, ge
nerous, beneficent, and fteadily good in fparing tfie
rival enemy he was able to deftroy, or he muft
have ruin d mankind :
Injhort^ he muft have ceas d
to have been a Devil, and muft have re-arTum d his
original, Angelic, heavenly nature 5 been fill d with
the principles of love to, and delight in the Works
of his Creator, and bent to propagate his Glory and
Jntereft 5 or he muft have put an end to the race
of man, whom it would be in his Power to deftroy,
and oblige his Maker to create a new fpecies, or
fortify the old with fome kind of defence, which
muft be invulnerable, and which his fiery darts
could not penetrate.
On this occafion differ me to make an excur-
fion from the ufual ftile of this Work, and with
ibme folemnity to exprefs my Thoughts thus :
How glorious is the wifdom and goodnefs of
the great Creator of the World ! in thusrellrain-
ing
of the D E V I L. 51
ing thefe feraphic OUTCASTS from the power of
afluming human or organic bodies ! which could
they do, envigorating them with the fupernatural
Powers, which, as Seraphs and Angels, they now
poilefsand might exert, they would be able even to
fright mankind from the face of vhe Earth, and to
deilroy and confound God s Creation 3 nay, even as
they are^ were not their power limited, they might
deitroy the Creation it felf, reverfe and over-turn
nature, and put the World into a general confla
gration : But were thofe immortal Spirits embodi
ed, tho they were not permitted to confound na
ture, they would be able to harrafs poor weak and
defenceleis man out of his wits, and render him
perfectly ufelefs, either to his Maker or himfelf.
But the Dragon is chained, the Devil s Power
is limited) he has indeed a vaftly extended Em
pire, being Prince of the Air, having, at leafl,
the whole Atmofphere to range in, and how far
that Atmofphere is extended, is not yet afcertain d
by the niceft obfervations 3 I fay at leaft^ becaufe
we do not yet know how far he may be allow d
to make excurfions beyond the Atmofphere of
this Globe into the planetary Worlds, and what
power he may exercife in all the habitable parts of
the filarfyfletn$ nay, of all thetotlierfolarjyfowf9
which, for ought we know, may exift in the
mighty extent of created fpace, and of which you
may hear farther in its order.
But let his power be what it will there, we arc
fure tis limited here, and that in two particulars j
firft, he is limited as above, from affuming body
or bodily fhapes with fub fiance ; and fecondly, from
exerting feraphic Powers, and a&ing with that fu
pernatural force, which, as an Angel, he was cer
tainly veiled with before the fall, and which we
are not certain is
yet taken from him -
y or at moir,
we do not know how much it
may or may not be
E 2, dimininYd
52 The H I ST O R Y
dimininYd by his degeneracy, and by the blow
given him at his expuldon : this we are certain,
that be his Power greater or lefs, he is reltrain d
from the exercife of it in this World 5 and he, who
was one equal to the Angel who kill d 180000
men in one night, is not able now, without a new
commiffion, to take away the life of one Job^ nor
to touch any thing he had.
But letusconfiderhim then limited and reflrain-
ed as he is, yet he remains a mighty, a terrible, an
immortal Being 3 infinitely fuperior to man, as well
in the dignity of his nature, as in the dreadful
powers he retains ftili about him 5 it is true the
brain-fick heads of our Enthufiafticks paint him
blacker than he is, and, as I have faid, wickedly
reprefent him clothed with terrors that do not
really belong to him &amp;gt;
as if the power of good and
evil was wholly vefted in him,and that he was plac
ed in the Throne of his Maker, to diftribute both
puniiliments and rewards 3 In this they are much
wrong, terrifying and deluding fanciful people a-
bout him, till they turn their heads, and fright
them into a belief that the Devil will let them
alone, if they do fuch and fuch good things &amp;gt;
or
carry them away with him they know not whither,
if they do not -,
as if the Devil, whofe proper
bufinefs is mifchief, feducing and deluding man
kind, and drawing them, in to be rebels like him-
felf, fhould threaten to feize upon them, carry
them away, and in a word, fall upon them to
hurt them, if
they did evil, and on the contrary,
be favourable and civil to them, if they did well.
Thus a poor deluded country fellow in our
Town, that had liv d a wicked, abominable, de-
bauch d life, was frighted with an Apparition, as
he calPd it, ofthe Devil; He fancy d that he fpoke
to him, and telling his tale to a good honeil chri-
ftian Gentleman his neighbour, that had a little
more
of the DEVI L, 53
more fcnfe than himfelf3 the Gentleman ask d him
if he was fare he really faw the Devil? yes, yes.
Sir, fays he^ I faw him very plain, and fo they be
gan the following difcourfe.
Gent. See him ! fee the Devil ! art thou fure of
it, Thomas?
fho. Yes, yes, I am fure enough of it, Mafter;
to be fure twas the Devil.
Gent. And how do you know twas the Devil,
fhomas? had you ever feen the Devil before ?
fho. No, no, I had never ieen him before, to be
fure -, but, for all that, I know twas the Devil.
Gent. Well, if
you re fure, Thomas^ there s no
contradicting you ; pray what clothes had he on?
fho. Nay, Sir, don t
jeft with me, he had no
clothes on, he was clothed with fire and brim-
Hone.
Gent. Was it dark or day light when you faw
him?
fho. O ! it was very dark, for it was midnight.
Gent. How could you fee him then ? did you fee
by the light of the fire you fpeak of?
fho. No, no, he gave no light himfelf5 but I
faw him, for all that.
Gent. But was it within doors, or out in the
ftrect?
fho. It was within, it was in my own Chamber,
when I was juft going into bed, that I faw him.
Gent. Well then, you had a candle, hadn t you?
fho. Yes, I had a candle, but it burnt as blue!
and as dim !
Gent. Well, but if the Devil was clothed with
fire and brimftone, he muft give you fome light,
there can t be fuch a fire as you fpeak of, but it
muft give a light with it.
fho, AT
0, 00, He gave no light, but I fmelt his
fire and brimftone 5 he left a fmell of it behind
him? when he was gone.
E 3 Gent.
54 The HISTORY
Gent. Well, fo you fay he had fire, but gave
no light, it was a deviliih fire indeed j did it
feel warm ? was the room hot while he was in it ?
Tbo. No, no, but I was hot enough without it,
for it
put me into a great fwcat with the fright.
Gent. Very well, he was all in fire, you fay, but
without light or heat, only, itfeems, he flunk of
brimftonej pray what iliapes was he in, what was
he like} for you fay you law him?
Tho. O! Sir, I faw t wo great flaring (aucer eyes,
enough to fright any body out of their wits.
Gent. And was that all
you (aw?
Tbo. No, I law his cloven-foot very plain, twas
as
big as one of our bullocks that goes to plow.
Gent. So you faw none of his body, but his eyes
and his feet ? a fine vifion indeed !
TJjo. Sir, that was enough to fend me going.
Gent. Going ! what did you run away from him ?
Tho. No, but I fled into bed at one jump, and funk
down and pull d the bed-clothes quite over me.
Gent. And what did you do that for?
Tho. To hide my felf from fuch a frightful
creature.
Gent. Why, if it had really been the Devil, do
you think the bed-clothes would have fecur d you
from him ?
Tho. Nay, I don t know, but in a fright it
was all I could do.
Gent. Nay, twas as wife as all the reft 5 but
come, Thomas, to be a little ferious, pray did he
jpcak to you ?
Tbo. Yes, yes, I heard a voice, but who it was
the Lord knows.
Gent. What kind of voice was it, was it like
a man s voice ?
Tbo^ No, it was a hoarfe ugly noife, like the croak
ing of a Frog, and it call d me by my name twice,
Thomas Dawfon^ Thomas Dawfon.
Gent.
of the DEVIL. 55
Gsnt. Well, did you anfvver ?
Tho. No, not I, 1 could not havefpokeaword
for my life 5 -why, I was frighted to death.
Gent. Did it
fay any thing elfe?
Tho. Tes, when it faw that I did not (peak, it
faid, Thomas Dawfon, Thomas Daivfon, you are
a wicked wretch, you lay with Jenny S lafl night j
if you don t repent ,
/ will take you away alive and
cany you to Hell, andyoujhall be damn*d, you wretch.
Gent. And was it true, Thomas, did you lye
with Jenny S the night before ?
Tho. Indeed Matter, why yes it was true, byt
I was very ferry afterwards.
Gent. But how fhould the Devil know \l,Thomas?
Tho. Nay, he knows it to be furej why, they
fay he knows every thing.
Gent. Well, but why fhould he be angry at that ?
he would rather bid you lye with her again, and
encourage you to lye with forty whores, than hin
der you: This can t be the Devil, Thomas.
Tho. Yes, yes, Sir, twas the Devil to be fure.
Gent. But he bid you repent too, you fay ?
Tho. Yes, he threatn d me if I did not.
Gent. Why, Thomas, do you think the Devil
would have you repent ?
Tho. Why no, that s true too, I don t know
what to fay to that j but what could it be ? twas
the Devil to be fure, it could be nobody elfe ?
Gent. No, no, twas neither the Devil, Thomas,
nor any body elfe, but your own frighted ima
gination -,
you had lain with that wench, and be
ing a young firmer of that kind, your Confcience
terrified you, told you the Devil would fetch
you away, and you would be damn dj and you
were fo perfuaded it would be fo, that you at lafl
imagined he was come for you indeed &amp;gt;
that you
faw him and heard him $ whereas, you may depend
upon it, \
JennyS will let

E 4 night,
5 736* H I S T O Pv Y
night, the Devil will hold the candle, or do any
thing to forward it, but will never diihirb you;
he s too much a friend to your wickednefs, it could
never be the Devil, Thomas $ twas only your own
guilt frighted yon, and that was Devil enough
too, if you knew the worfl of it, you need no
other enemy.
Tho. Why that s true, Matter, one would think
the Devil mould not bid me repent, that s true &amp;gt;
but certainly twas the Devil for all that.
Now fbomas was not the only man that ha
ving committed a flagitious crime had been de
luded by his own imagination, and the power of
fancy, to think the Devil was come for him $
whereas the Devil, to give him his clue, is too
honed: to pretend to fuch things -&amp;gt;
tis his bufinefs
to perfuade men to offend, not to repent 5 and he
profefles no other , he may prcfs men to this or
that a&ion, by telling them tis no fin, no offence,
no breach of God s Law, and the like, when
really tis both &amp;gt;
but to prefsthem to repent, when
they have offended, that s
quite out of his
way j
tis none of his bufinefs, nor does he pretend to it 3
therefore, let no man charge the Devil with what
he is not concerned in.
But to return to his Perfon, he is, as I have {aid,
notwith(landing his loft glory, a
mighty,
a ter
rible and an immortal Spirit 5 he is himfclf calPd
a Prince, the Prince of the Po^er of the Air 3 the
Prince of Darknefs, the Prince of Devils, and the
like, and his attending Spirits
are call d his Angels :
ib that however Satan has loft the glory and
reftitude of his Nature, by his apoftate Hate, yet
he retains a greatnefs and magnificence, which
places him above our rank, and indeed above our
conception &amp;gt;
for we know not what he is, any
more than we know what the bleiTed
Angels
are j
of whom we can fay no more than that they arc
winiftring
of the DEVIL. 57
winiftring Spirits, 8tc. as the Scripture has de-
crib d them.
Two things, however, may give us fome in-
fight into the nature of the Devil, in the prefent
Hate he is in ; and thefe we have a clear difcovery
of in the whole feries of his Conduct from the
Beginning.
i. That he is the vanquifli d but implacable ene
my of God his Creator, who has conquer d
him, andexpelPd him from the habitations
of blifs -
y on which account he is fill d with
envy, rage, malice, and all uricharitablenefs 5
would dethrone God and overturn the thrones
of Heaven, if it was in his
power.
z. That he is man s irreconcilable Enemy 5 not
as he is a man, nor on his own account iim-
ply, nor for any advantage he (the Devil)
can make by the ruin and deflruction of man j
but in meer envy at the felicity he is
fuppofed
to enjoy as Satan s rival ; and as he is
appoin
ted to fucceed Satan and his Angels in the
poffeffion of thole glories
from which they
are fallen.
And here I mult take upon me to fay, Mr.
Milton makes a wrong judgment of the reafon of
Satan s refolution to difturb the felicity
of man ;
He tells us it was meerly to affront God his
Maker, rob him of the glory defign d in his new
work of creation, and to difappoint him in his
main defign, namely, the creating a new fpecies
of creatures in a perfect reftituoc of foul, and
after his own image, from whom he might ex
pect a new Fund of glory fhould be rais d, and
who was to appear as the triumph of the Meffiah s
victory over the Devil. In all which Satan could
not be fool enough not to know that lie ihould
be
58 The HISTORY
be difappointed by the fame Power which had fo
eminently counter-a6ted his rage before.
But, I believe, the Devil went upon a much
more probable defign -,
and tho he may be faid to act
upon a meaner principle than that of pointing his
rage at the perfonal glory of his Creator j yet I
own, that in my opinion, it was by much the
more rational undertaking, and more likely to fuc-
ceed 5 and that was, that whereas he perceived this
new fpecies of creatures had a fublime as well as a,
human part, and were made capable of pofleffing
the manlions of eternal Beatitude, from whence,
he (Satan) and his Angels were e^pell
d and irre
trievably banifh d j envy at fuch a rival mov d him
by all
poflible artifice, for he faw him deprived of
capacity to do it by force^ to render him unworthy
like himfelf} that bringing him to fall into re
bellion and difobedience, he might fee his Rival
damn d with him &amp;gt;
and thofe who were intended

the abfence of fo many millions of fallen Angels,
be caft out into the fame darknefs with them.
How he came to know that this new fpecies of
creatures were liable tor fuch imperfection, is beft
explained by the Devil s
prying, vigilant difpofi-
tion, judging or leading him to judge by himfelfj
(for he was as near being infallible as any of God s
creatures had been) and then inclining him to try
whether it was fo or no.
Modern Naturalifts, efpecially fome who have
not fo large a chanty for the fair fex, as I have, tell
us, that as foon as ever Satan faw the woman, and
look d in her face, he faw evidently that fhe
was the beft form d creature to make a Tool of^
and the beft to make a hypocrite of, that could be
made, and therefore the moft fitted for his purpofe.
i. He faw by fome thwart lines in her face,
legible, perhaps, to himfelf only) that there was
a throne
of the DEVIL; 59
a throne ready prepared for the fin of pride to fit
in flate upon, efpecially if it took an early pofTef-
fion : EVE you may fuppofe was a perfect Beauty,
if ever fuch a thing may befuppofedin the human
frame &amp;gt;
her figure being fo extraordinary, was the
groundwork of his project} there needed no more
than to bring her to be vain of it, and to conceit
that it either was fo, or was infinitely more fub-
lime and beautiful than it really was 3 and having
thus tickl d her vanity, to introduce Pride gradu
ally, till at lafl he might perfuade her, that fhe
was really Angelic, or of heavenly Race, and
wanted nothing but to eat the forbidden fruit,
and that would make her fomething more excel
lent ftill.
2.
Looking farther into her Frame, and with
a nearer view to her imperfections, he faw room to
conclude that fhe was of a conftitution eafy to be
feduc d, and efpecially by flattering her ; railing
a commotion in her Soul, and adiflurbance among
her paffions $ and accordingly he fet himfelf to
work, to difturb her repofe, and put dreams of
great things into her head ; together with fome
thing of a namelefs Kind, which ( however, fome
have been ill-natur d enough to fuggeft ) I fhall
not injure the Devil fo much as to mention, with
out better evidence.
3. But, befides this, he found, upon the very
firft
furvey of her outfide, fomething fo veiy
charming in her mein and behaviour, fo engag
ing as well as agreeable in the whole texture of
her perfon, and withal fuch a fprightly wit, fuch
a vivacity of parts, fuch a fluency of tongue, and
above all, fuch a winning prevailing whine in her
fmiles, or at leaft in her tears, that he made no
doubt if he could but once delude her, fhe would
eafily be brought to delude Adam^ whom he found
fet not only a great value upon her perfon, but
was
60 The HI ST O R Y
was perfectly captivated by her charms j in a
word, he faw plainly, that if he could but ruin
her, he fhould eafily make a Devil cf her, to ruin
her husband, and draw him into any gulph of mis
chief, were it ever fo black and dreadful, that ihc
fhould firft fall into herfelfj how far fome may
be wicked enough, from hence, to fuggeflof the
fair feu, that they have been Devils to their huf-
bands ever fince, I cannot fay $ J
hope they will
not be fo unmerciful to difcover truths of fuch
fatal confequence, tho they ihould come to their
knowledge.
Thus fubtle and penetrating has Satan been
from the beginning &amp;gt;
and who can wonder that upon
thefe difcoveries made into the woman s iniide,
he went immediately to work with her, rather
than with Adam? not but that one would think,
if Adam was fool enough to be deluded by his
wife, the Devil might have feen fo much of it
in his countenance, as to have encouraged him to
make his attack directly upon him, and not go
round about, beating the bum, and ploughing with
the Heifer -,
fetting upon the woman firit, and then
fetting her upon her husband, who might as eaiily
have been impofed upon as fhe.
Other Commentators upon this critical Text
fuggeft to us, that Eve was not fo pleafed with
the hopes of being made aGaddefs&amp;gt; That the pride
of a Seraphic Knowledge did not fo much work
upon her imagination to bring her to confent, as
a certain fecret Notion infus d into her head by
the fame wicked inflrument, that fhe fhould be
wifer than
Adam^ and fhould by the fuperiority
of her undcrftanding, neceflarily have the govern
ment over him $ which, at prefent, fhe was fen-
lible fhe had not, he being matter of a particular
air of gravity and majefty, as well as of firength,
infinitely fuperior to her.

This is an ill-natur d fuggeftion ; but it muft
be confefs d the impatient defire of government,
which (fince that) appears in the general Beha-
viour of the fex,and particularly of governing huf-
bands, leaves too much room tb legitimate the
fuppofition.
The Expofitors, who are of this opinion, add
to it, that this being her original crime, or the
particular temptation to that crime $ Heaven
thought fit to fhew his juftice, in making her
more entire fubjeftion to her husband be a part
of the Curfe, that fhe might read her fin in the
puniftiment, (viz.) he Jhall rule over thee.
I
only give the general hint of thefe things
as they appear recorded in the annals of Satan s
firft Tyranny, and at the beginning of his govern
ment in the World 5 thofe that would be more
particularly informed, may enquire of him and
know farther.
I cannot however, but obferve here with
feme regret, how it
appears by the confequence,
that the Devil was not miftaken when he made
an early judgment of Mrs. Eve -,
and how Satan
really went the right way to work, to judge of
her y tis certain the Devil had nothing to do but
to look in her face, and upon a near ileady view
he might eafily fee there, an inftrumcnt for his
Turn 5 nor has he fail d to make her a Tool ever
fince, by the very methods which he at firft
pro-
poled ^ to which, perhaps, he has made fome ad
ditions in the corrupting her compofition, as well
as her underftanding j qualifying her to be a corn-
pleat fnare to the poor weaker ve/el M A N &amp;gt;
to
wheedle him with her Syren s voice, abufe him

noife of that very Tongue, which at firft com
manded him to Sin. For it is
yet a debate which
the Learned have not decided, whether fhe per-
fuaded and entreated him, or like a true fhe- ty
rant, exercifed her authority and ,oblig d him to
eat the forbidden fruit.
And therefore a certain author, whofe name,
for fear of the Sex s refentment I conceal, brings
her in, calling to Adam at a great diftance, in
an imperious haughty manner, beckoning to him
with her hand, thus 5 Here, fays fhe, you coward
ly faint-hearted wretch^ take this branch of heaven

He tells
you Adam hung back a little at firfr,
and trembl d, afraid to trefpafs : What alls the
SOT, (ays the new Termagant? what are you afraid
of? did God forbid you! yes^ and why ? that we

C H A P. V.
Of the fiation Satan had in Heaven before
he fell ; the nature and original of his
crimey and fome of Mr. Milton j miflakes
about it.
THUS
far I have gone upon general obfer-
vation, in this great affair of Satan and his
Empire in the World &amp;gt;
I now come to my Title^
and fhall enter upon the hiftorical part, as the
main work before me.
Befides what has been faid Poetically, relating
to the fall and wandering condition of the Devil
and his Hoft, which poetical part I offer only
as an excurfion, and defire it fhould be taken fo &amp;gt;
I fhall give you what I think is deduced from good
originals on the part of Satatfs flory in a few
words.
He was one of the created Angels, form d by
the fame omnipotent hand and glorious power,
who
64 The H I S T O R Y
who created the Heavens and the Earth, and all
that is therein : This innumerable heavenly hoft,
as we have reafon to believe, contain d Angels of
higher and lower ftations, of greater and ol- lefler
degree, exprefs d in the Scripture by Thrones, Do
minions, and Principalities :
This, I think, we
have as much reafon to believe, as we have, that
there are Stars in the Firmament (or ftarry Hea
vens) of greater and of lefler magnitude.
What particular ftation among the immortal
Choir of Angels, this Arch-feraph, this Prince
of Devils, call d Satan, was plac d in before his ex-
pulfion, that indeed, we cannot come at the
knowledge of, at leaft, not with fuch an Autho^
rity as may be depended upon &amp;gt;
but as from Scrip
ture authority, he is
plac d at the head of all the
Apoftate armies, after he was fallen, we cannot
think it in the leaft afluming to fay, that he might
be fuppofed to be one of the principal Agents in
the Rebellion which happened in Heaven, and
confequently that he might be one of the higheft
in dignity there, before that Rebellion.
The higher his ftation, the lower, and with
the greater precipitation, was his overthrow 5 and
therefore, thofe words, tho taken in another
fenfe, may very well be apply d to him : How
art thou fallen, O Lucifer ! Son of the Morning !
Having granted the dignity of his Perfon, and
the high ftation in which he was placed among
the heavenly Hoft ; it would come then neceflari-
ly to inquire into the nature of his fall, and above
all, a little into the reafon of it
-
9 certain it is, he
did fall, was guilty of Rebellion and Difobedience,
the juft effect of Pride ; fins, which, in that holy
place, might well be call d wonderful.
But what to me is more wonderful, and which,
I think, will be very ill accounted for, is, how
came feeds of crime to rife in the Angelic Nature?
created
of the DEVIL. 65
treated in a ftate of perfect, unfpotted holinefs ?
how was it firft found in a place where no unclean
thing can enter ? how came ambition, pride, or
envy to generate there ? could there be offence
where there was no crime ? could untainted puri
ty breed corruption ? could that nature contami
nate and infect, which was always Drinking iri
principles of perfection ?
Happy tis to me, that writing the Hiflor}^
not folvingthe Difficulties of Satan s Affairs, is
my
province in this Work j that I am to relate the Fact,
not give reafons for it, or fign caufes 5 if it was
otherwife, I fhould break off at this difficulty, for
I
acknowledge I do not fee thro it j neither do I
think that the great Milton^ after all his fine Ima
ges and lofty Excurfions upon the Subject, has
left it one jot clearer than he found it : Some are
of opinion, and among them the great Dr. J? -r,
that crime broke in
upon them at fome interval,
when they omitted but one moment fixing their
eyes and thoughts on the glories of the divine
face, to admire and adore, which is the full em
ployment of Angels 5 but even this, tho it
goes
as high as imagination can carry us, does not
reach it, nor, to me, make it one jot more coin-
prehenfible than it was before &amp;gt;
all I can fay to it
here, is, thaty^ it w^j, the fact was upon Record,
and the reje6bed Troop are in being, whofe cir-
cumfiances confefs the Guilt, and flill
groan un
der the Punifhment.
If you will bear with a poetic excurfion upon
die fubjeft, not to folve but to illuflrate the diffi
culty 5 take it in a few lines, thus.

Ugly. as is the crime, for which he fell.
Fitted by thce to make a local Hell,
For fuch muft be the place where either of youi
(dwell.
Thus, as I told you, I only moralize upon the
fubjccl:, but as to the difficulty, I muft leave it as
I find it, unlefs, as I hinted at faft , I could pre-
Vail with Satan to fet
pen to paper, and write
this part of his own Hiftory : No queftion, but
he could let us into the fecret j but to be plain,
I doubt I fhall tell fo many plain truths of the
Devil) in this Hiftory, and difcover fo
many of his
fecrets, which it is not for his intereft to havedif-
cover d, that before I have done, the Devil and I
may not be fo good friends as you may fuppofe
we are 5 at leaft, not friends enough to obtain fuch
a favour of him, tho it be for public good j fo
we muft be content till we come ont other fide the
Blue-Blanket^ and then \ve {hall know the whole
Story.
But now, tho as I (aid, I will not attempt to
folve the difficulty, I may, I hope, venture to
tell you, that there is not ib much difficulty in it,
as at firft
fight appears : and efpecially not fo much
as fome people would make us believe ; let us (ec
how others are miftaken in it, perhaps, that
may help us a little in the enquiry $ for to know
what it is not^ is one help towards knowing what
it is.
Mr. Milton has indeed told us a great many mer
ry things of the Devil, in a moft formal, folemn
manner &amp;gt;
till in fhort he has made a good PLAY
of Heaven and Hell , and no doubt if he had liv d
in our times, he might have had it acted with our
Pluto and Proferpitie. He has made fine Speeches
both ht- God and the Devil^ and a little addition
might
of the DEVIL. 69
might have turnM it a la modern into a Harlequin
Dieu 6f Diable.
I confefs I don t well know how far the do
minion of Poetry extends itfelf 5 it feems the Buts.
and Bounds of Parnaffus are not yet afcertaind ;
fo that for ought I know, by vcrtue of their an-
tienc privileges call d Licenlia Poetarum, there can
be no Blafphemy in Verfe &amp;gt;
as fome of our Divines
fay there can be no Treafon in the Pulpit. But
they that will venture to write that way, ought
to be better fatisfy
d about that Point than I am.
Upon this foot Mr. Milton, to grace his Poem,
and give room for his Towring Fancy, has
gone a length beyond all that ever went before
him, fince Ovid in his Metamorphofis. Fie has
indeed complimented GOD Almighty with a flux
of lofty words, and great founds 5 and has made a
very fine Story of the Devil, but he has made a
meerje ne fcay Quoi of Jefus Chrift. In one line
he has him riding on a Cherub, and in ano
ther fitting on a Throne, both in the very fame
moment of action. In another place he has
brought him in making a Speech to his Saints,
when tis evident he had none there &amp;gt;
for we all
know Man was not created till a long while after j
and no body can be fo dull as to fay the Angels
may be called Saints, without the greateft abfar-
dity in nature. Befides, he makes CHRIST him-
felf diftinguifh them, as in two feveral Bands,
and of differing Perfons and Species, as to be fure
they are.

Par. Loft, lib, \\.fo. 174.
F 3 So
70 The HISTORY
So that CHRIST here is
brought in drawing up his
Army before the laft Battle, and making a
Speech
to them, to tell them they fhall only ftand by
in warlike order, but that they fhall have no oo
caflon to fight, for he alone will engage the Re
bels. Then in embattling his
Legions, he places
the Saints here, and the Angels there, as if one
were the main Battle of Infantry, and the other
the Wings of Cavalry. But who are thole Saints?
they are indeed all of Milton s own making -,
tis
certain there were no Saints at all in Heaven or
Earth at that time j GOD and his Angels fill d up
the place &amp;gt;
and till fome of the dngels fell, and
Men were created, had liv d, and were dead, there
could have been no Saints there. Saint Abel was
certainly the Proto-Saint of all that ever were feen
in Heaven^ as well as the Proto-martyr of all that
have been upon Earth.
Juft fuch another Mifhke, not to call it a Blun
der, he makes about Hell; which he not only
makes LOCAL, but gives it a
being before the Fall
of the Angels &amp;gt;
and brings it in
opening its mouth
to receive them. This is fo contrary to the na
ture of the thing, and fo great an abfurdity, that
no Poetic Licenfe can account for it j for tho Poefie
may form Stories, as Idea and Fancy may furnifh
Materials, yet Pocty muft not break in upon Chro
nology, and make things which in time were to
exift, act before they exifled.
Thus a Painter may make a fine piece of Work,
the fancy may be good, the ftrokes mafterly, and
the beauty of the Workmanfhip inimitably curi
ous and fine, and yet have fome unpardonable im
proprieties which marr the whole Work. So
the famous Painter of Toledo painted the ftory of
the three Wifemen of the Eafl coming to wor-
{hip, and bring their prefents to our Lord upon his
birth at Bethlehem^ where he reprefents them as
three
.of the DEVIL. 71
three Arabian or Indian Kings 5 two of them are
white, and one black 5 ^But unhappily when he
drew the latter part of them kneeling, which to
be fure was done after their fac.es 5 their legs
being neceflarily a little intermix d, he made three
black feet for the Negroe King, and but three white
feet for the two white Kings, and yet never difco-
ver d the miftake till the piece was preferred to
the King, and hung up in the great Church. As
this is an unpardonable error in Sculpture or Lim
ning, it muft be much more fo in Poetry, where
the Images muft have no improprieties, much lefs
inconfiftencies.
In a word, Mr. Milton has indeed made a fine
Poem, but it is the Devil of a Hiftory. I can ea-
lily
allow Mr. Milton to make Hills and Dales,
flowry Meadows and Plains (and the like) in Hea
ven &amp;gt;
and places of Retreat and Contemplation in
Hell; tho I muft add, that it can be allowed to no
Poet on Earth but Mr. Milton. Nay, I will allow
Mr. Milton^ if you pleafe, to fet the Angels a dancing
in Heaven^ lib. v. fo. 138. and the Devils a fing-
ing in Hell, lib. i.
fo. 44. tho they are in ihort,
efpecially the laft,moft horrid Abfurdities. But I
cannot allow him to make their Mufick in Hell to
be harmonious and charming as he does &amp;gt;
fuch
Images being incongruous, and indeed (hocking to
Nature. Neither can I think we fhould allow things
to be plac d out of time in Poetry, any more than
in Hiftory &amp;gt;
tis a confufionof Images which is al-
low d to be difallow d by all the Criticks of what
tribe or fpecies foever in the world, and is indeed
unpardonable. But we fhall find fo many more
of thele things in Mr. Milton^ that really taking
notice of them all, would carry me quite out of
my way, I being at this time not writing the
Hiftory of Mr. Milton^ but of the Devil: befides,
F 4 Mr.
72 The HISTORY
Mr. Milton is fuch a celebrated Man, that who but
he that can write the Hiftory of the Devil dare
meddle with him ?
But to come back to the bufinefs. As I had can-
tion d you againtl running to Scripture for fhel-
ter in cafes of difficulty, Scripture weighing ve
ry little
among the people I am directing my
Speech to 5 fo indeed Scripture gives but very lit
tle light into any thing ofthe Devil s
Story before
his Fall, and but to very little of it for fome time
after.
Nor has Mr. Milton faid one word to folve the
main difficulty (viz.) How the Devil came to
fall, and how Sin came into Heaven , how the
fpotlefs feraphic Nature could receive infection,
whence the contagion proceeded, what noxious
matter could emit corruption there, how and
whence any vapour to poiibn the Angelick Frame
could rife
up, or how it increased and grew up to
crime/ But all this he paries over, and hurrying
up that part in two or three words, only tells us,

fon? Here we muft bid Mr. Milton good night 5
for, In plain terms, he is in the dark about it, and
fo we are all 3 and the mofl that can be faid, is, that
we know the fad is fo, but nothing of the nature
or reafoh of it,&quot;
But

But to come to the Hiftory : The Angels fell,
they finn d (wonderful*!) in Heaven, and God
cafl them out j what their fin was is not explicit,
but in general tis call d a Rebellion againftGoD j
all fin mull be To.
Mr. Milton here takes upon him to give the Hi
ftory of it, as particularly as if he had been born
there, and came down hither on purpofe to give
us an account of it $ (I hope he is better inform d
by this time y) but this he does in fuch a manner,
as joftles with Religion, and fhocks our Faith in fo
many points neceflary to be believ d, that we
mull forbear to give up to Mr. Milton, or muft fet
afide part of the iacred Text, in fuch a manner, as
will afllil fome people to fet it all afide.
I mean by this, his invented Scheme of the
Son s
being declared in Heaven to be begotten
then, and then to be declar d Generalifiimo of all the
Armies of Heaven 3 and of the Father s fummon-
ing all the Angels of the heavenly Hofl to fub-
mit to him, and pay him homage. The words
are quoted already, page 32.
I mull own the Invention, indeed, is
very fine;
the Images exceeding magnificent, the Thought
rich and bright, and, in fome refpecl:, truly fub-
lime : But the Authorities fail mofl wretchedly,
and the mifs-timing of it, is
unfufferably grofs,
as is noted in the Introduction to this Work 5
for Chrift is not declar d the Son of God but on
Earth j tis true, tis
fpoken from Heaven, but
then tis

This is, indeed, too grofs &amp;gt;
at this meeting he
makes God declare the Son to be that day begot-
ten^ as before &amp;gt;
had he made him not begotten
that day, but declared General that day, it would
be reconcileable with Scripture and with fenfe 3 for
either the begetting is meant of ordaining to an
office, or elfe the eternal Generation falls to the
ground 5 and if it was to the office (Mediator)
then Mr. Milton is out in afcribing another fix d

declaring him that day, is

only by the Refurreftion of the dead^ and this is
both a Declaration in Heaven and in Earth. Rom.
i.
4. And Milton can have no authority to tell
us, there was any Declaration of it in Heaven be
fore this, except it be that dull authority call d
foetlc Licenfej which will not pafs in fo folemn an
affair as that.
But the thing was neceflary to Milton^ who
wanted to affign fome caufe or original of the
JDmTs Rebellion j and fo, as Ifaid above^ the de-
iign is well laid, it
only wants two Trifles call d
Truth and Hiftory , fo I leave it to ftruggle for
it felf.
This Ground-plot being laid, he has a fair field
for the Devil to play the Rebel in, for he imme
diately brings him in, not fatisfy d with the Ex
altation of the Son of God. The cafe muft be
thus 5 Satan being an eminent Arch-an^el, and
perhaps, the higheft of all the Angelic Train,
hearing this fovereign Declaration, that the Son
vZ, Of
of the DEVIL; 75
of God wasdeclar d to be Head or Generaliflimo of
all the heavenly Hoft, took it ill to fee another
put into the high ftation over his head^ as the Sol
diers call it 3 he, perhaps, thinking himfelf the fe-
ni or Officer, and difdaining tofubmit to any but to
his former immediate Sovereign 3 in fhort, he threw
up his Commiffion, and, in order not to be compel d
to obey, revolted and broke out in open Rebellion.
All this part is a Decoration noble and great,
nor is there any objection to be made againit the
invention, becaufe a deduction of probable Events j
but the Plot is
wrong laid, as is obferv d above,
becaufe contradicted by the Scripture account,
according to which Chrift was declared in Hea
ven, not then, but from Eternity, and not declar
ed with power, but on Earth, (viz.) in his victory
over Sin and Death, by the Refurre&ion from the
dead : fo that Mr. Milton is not orthodox in this
part, but lays an avow d foundation for the cor
rupt Doctrine of Arius^ which fays, there was a
time when Chrift was not the Son of GOD,
But to leave Mr. Milton to his flights, I
agree
with him in this part, viz. that the wicked or
finning Angels, with the great Arch-angel at the
head of them, revolted from their obedience, even
in Heaven it felf 3 that Satan began the wicked
defection, and being a Chief among the heavenly
Hoft, confequently carry d over a great party with
him, who all
together rebel d againft God 3 that
upon this Rebellion they were (entenc d, by the
righteous judgment of GOD, to be expel d the
holy Habitation 5 this, bcfides the authority of
Scripture, we have vifible teftimomes of, from
the Devils themfelves3 their influences and ope
rations among us every day, of which Mankind
are witneiTes 3 in all the merry things they do in his
name, and under his prote&ion, in almoft every
fcene of life
they pafe thro , whether we talk of
things
76 The H I S T O R Y
things done openly or in Mafquerade, things done
in or out of it, things done in earneft or in jell.
But then, what comes of the long and bloody
War that Mr. Milton gives fuch a full and parti
cular account of, and the terrible Battels in Hea
ven between Michael with the royal Army of An
gels on one hand, and Satan with his rebel Holt
on the other j in which he fuppofes the numbers
and ilrength to be pretty near equal ? but at
length brings in the Devils Army, upon doubling
their rage and bringing new engines of war into
the field, putting Michael and all the faithful Army
to the Worfl &amp;gt;
and, in a word, defeats them? For
tho they were not put to a plain flight, in which
cafe he mutt, at lead, have given an account of
two or three thoufand millions of Angels cut in
pieces and wounded, yet he allows them to give
over the fight, and make a kind of retreat &amp;gt;
fo
making way for the compleat vidory of the Son
of GOD : Now this is all invention, or at leaft, a
borrow d thought from the old Poets, and the
Fight of the Giants againft Jupiter, fo nobly dc-
iign d by Ovid, almort two thoufand years ago &amp;gt;
and there twas well enough ; but whether Poetic
Fancy fhould be allow d to fable upon Heaven, or
no, and upon the King of Heaven too, that I
leave to the Sages.
By this expuliion of the Devils, it is allow d
by moil z^uthors, they are, ipfofaffo, ftript of the
Rectitude and Holinefs of their Nature, which
was their Beauty and Perfection 5 and being in-
gulph d in the abyfs of irrecoverable ruin, tis
no matter where, from that very time they lolt
tKeir Angelic beautiful Form, commenced ugly
frightful Monfters and Devils, and became evil
doers, as well as evil Spirits j fill d with a horrid
malignity and enmity againft their Maker, and
with a hellifh refblution to fhew and ex-
i ert
DEVIL; 77
crt it on all occafions , retaining however their
exalted fpirituous Nature, and having a vail ex-
tenfive power of Adion, all which they can ex
ert in nothing elfe but doing evil, for they are en
tirely diverted of either Power or will to do good^
and even in doing evil, they are under reflraints
and limitations of a iuperior Power, which it is
their Torment, and, perhaps, a great part of their
Hell that they cannot break thro .
CHAP. VI.
What became of the Devil and his Hofl of
fallen Spirits after their being expelld
from Heaven, and his ixandring condi
tion till the Creation ; with fome more of
Mr. M.\\totisabfurditieson that fubjeEi.
HAVING
thus brought the Devil and his
innumerable Legions to the edge of the
Bottomlels-pit, it remains, before I bring them
to aftion, that fome enquiry fhould be made into
the pofture of their affairs immediately after their
precipitate Fall, and into the place of their im
mediate Rcfidence &amp;gt;
for this will appear to be very
neceflary to Satan s Hi(lory, and indeed, fo as
that without it, all the farther account we have
to give of him, will be inconfiftent and imperfecb.
And firft, I take upon me to lay down fomc
Fundamentals, which I believe I {hall be able to
make out Hiflorically, tho , perhaps, not fo Geo
graphically as fome have pretended to do,
I. That Satan was not immediately, nor is
yet lock d down into the Abyis of a local
/&//, fiich as is
fuppofed by fome, and fiich
as he fhall be at lail $ or that,
2. If
7 8 The H I S T O R Y
z. If he was, he has certain liberties allowed him
for excurfions into the Regions ofthis Air, and
certain fpheres of action, in which he can,
and does move, to do, like a very Devil as he is9
all the mifchief he can, and of which we fee
fo many examples both about us and in us 5
in the inquiry after which, I fhall take occafi-
on to examine whether the Devil is not in
mod of us, fometimes, if not in all of us one
time or other.
3.
That Satan has no particular refidence in
this Globe or Earth where we live} that he
rambles about among us, and marches over
and over our whole country, he and his
Devils in Camps volant &amp;gt;
but that he pitches
his grand Army or chief Encampment in our
Adjacencies or Frontiers, which the Philofo-
phers call jftmofpbere &amp;gt;
and whence he is
call d the Prince of the Power of that Ele
ment or part of the World we call Air ^
from whence he fends out his Spies, his
Agents and EmifTaries, to get intelligence,
and to carry his Commiflions to his trufty
and well beloved Coufins and Counfellors on
Earth, by which his bufinels is done, and his
affairs carried on in the World.
Here, again, I meet Mr. Milton full in my face,
who will have it, that the Devil^ immediately at
his expulfion, roll d down directly into a Hell
proper and local -, nay, he meafures the very di-
flancc, at leall gives the length of the journey by
the time they were pafling or falling, which, he
fays, was nine days 5 a good Poetical flight, but
neither founded on Scripture or Philofophy&amp;gt;
he
might every jot as well have brought Hell up to
the Walls of Heaven, advanced to receive them,
or he ought to have confider d the fpace which
is
of the DEVI L. 79
is to be allow d to any locality, let him take what
part
of infinite diftance between Heaven and a
created Hell he pleafes.
But let that be as Mr. Milton s
extraordinary
genius pleafes
to place it 5 the paflage, it feems, is
juft
nine days betwixt Heaven and Hell j well might Z&amp;gt;/-
ves then fee father Abraham, and talk to him too &amp;gt;
but then the great Gulph which Abraham tells him
was fix d between them, does not feem to be fo
large, as according to Sir Ifaac Newton^ Dr. Hal-
ley, Mr. Whlfton^ and the reft of our Men of Sci
ence, we take it to be.
But fuppofe the paflage to be nine Days, ac
cording to Mr. Milton^ what foliow d ?
why Hell
gap d wide&amp;gt; open d its frightful mouth, and re*
ceived them all at once $ millions and thoufands of
millions as they were, it received them all at a
gulp, as we call it, they had no difficulty to go
in, no, none at all.

All this, as Poetical, we may receive, but not
at all as Hiftorical j for then come difficulties infupe-
rable in our way, fome of which may be as fol
low :
(i Hell is here fuppofed to be a place j nay
a place created for the puniihment of Angels ani
Men, and likewife created long before thofe had
fallen, or thefe had Being j this makes me fay, Mr,
Milton was a good Poet, but a bad Hiftorian : 20-
fhet was prepar d of old, indeed, but it was for
the King, that is to fay, it was prepar d for thofe
whofe lot it fhould be to come there j but this
does not at all
fuppofe it was prepar d before it was
refolv d whether there ihould be fubjebs for it,
or no -
y elfe we muft fuppofe both Men and An
gels were made by the glorious and upright Ma
ker
80 The HISTORY
kcr of all things, on purpofe for dcflrucciori,
which would be incongruous and abfurd.
But there is worfe yet to come j in the next
place he adds, that Hell having receiv d them,
clos d upon them j that is to fay, took them in$
clos d or {hut its Mouth j and in a word, they were
lock d in, as it was faid in another place, they
were lock d in, and the Key is
carry d up to Hea
ven and kept there ; for ive know the Angel came
down from Heaven, having the Key of the Bot-
tomlefs-piti but firft, fee Mr. Milton.

Nine days they fell, confounded chaos roar d

Hell at lad:

Unquenchable.
This Scheme is
certainly deficient, if not ab
furd, and I think is more fo than any other he has
laid} tis evident, neither Satan or his Hoft of
Devils are, no not any of themy yet, even now,
confin d in the eternal Prifon, where the Scrip
ture fays, he {hall be referred in chains of darknefs.
They muft have mean thoughts of Hell^ as a Pri
fon, a local Confinement, that can fuppofe the
Devil able to break Goal, knock off his Fetters,
and come abroad, if he had been once lock d in
there, as Mr. Milton fays he was : Now we know
that he is abroad again^ he prefented himfelf be
fore God, among his neighbours, when Job s cafe
came to be difcours d of-
y and more than that, it s
plain he was a prifoner at large, by his anfwer to
God s
queftion, which was, whence comeft thou ?
to which he anfwer d, from going to and fro thro&quot;
the
of the DEVIL. Si
the Earth^ &c, this, I fay, is
plain, and if it be as
certain that Hell clofed upon them, I demand
then, how got he out? and why was there not a
Proclamation for apprehending him, as there uiual-
ly is, after fuch Rogues as break prifon ?
In fhort, the true Account of the Devil s Cir-
cumftances, fince his Fall from Heaven, is much
more likely to be thus : That he is more ofa Vagrant
than aPrifoner, that he is a Wanderer in the wild
unbounded Waft, where he and his Legions, like
the Hoords of fartary, who, in the wild Coun
tries of Karakathay, the Deferts of Barkan, Kaffan,
and dftracan, live up and down where they find
proper 5 fo Satan and his innumerable Legions rove
about hie & ubique^ pitching their Camps (being
Beafts of prey) where they find the moft
Spoil j
watching over this World, (and all the other
Worlds for ought we know, and if there are any
fuch,) I fay watching, and feeking who they may
devour, that is, who they may deceive and delude,
and fo deftroy, for devour they cannot.
Satan being thus confin d to a
vagabond, wan-
dring, unfettl d Condition, is without any certain
Abode j Fortho
1
he has, in confequence of his An
gelic Nature, a kind of Empire in the liquid Waft or
Air \ yet, this is
certainly part of his punifhment,
that he is
continually hovering over this inhabited
Globe of Earth j fwellingwith the Rage of Envy,
at the Felicity of his Rival, Man 5 and ftudyingali
the means poffible to injure and ruin him &amp;gt;
but ex
tremely limited in Power, to his unfpeakable Mor
tification : This is his prefent State, without any
fix d Abode, Place, or Space, allowed him to reft
the Sole of his Foot upon.
From his Expulfion, I take his firft View of
Horror to be that, of looking back towards the
Heaven which he had loll -
y there to fee the
Chafrn or Opening made up, out at which, as at a
G Breach
S2, The HISTORY
Breach in the Wall of the holy Place, he Wf:$
thrall Head-long by the Power which expel d him *
I fay, to fee the Breach repair d, the Mounds built
up, the Walls garifon d with millions of Angels,
and am d with Thunders 5 and, above all, made
terrible by that Glory from whofe Prefence they
were expel d, as is
Poetically hinted at before.
Upon this fight, tis no wonder (if there was
fuch a Place) that they fled till the Darknefs might
cover them, and tha-t
they might be out of the
View of fo hated a Sight.
Wherever they found it, you may be furc
they pitch d their fir ft
Camp, and began, after
many a four Reflc6tion upon what was pafs d, to
confider and think a little, upon what was to
come.
If I had as much perfonal Acquaintance with
the Devil, as would admit it, and could depend
upon the Truth ofwhat Anfwer he would give me,
the firft Queftion I would ask him, fhould be,,
what Mealures they refolv d on at their firft AfTem-
bly ? and the next fhould be, how they were em
ploy d in all that fpace of Time, between their fo
flying the Face of their almighty Conqueror, and
the Creation of Man ? as for the Length of the
Time, which, according to the Learn d, was
twenty thoufand Years, and according to the more
Learned, not half a Quarter fo much, I would
not concern my Curioiky much about it $ tis
molt certain, there was a con fiderablc time between,
but of that immediately 3 firft let me enquire what
they were doing all that time.
The Devil and hisHoft, being thn?, I fay, call
out of Heaven, and not yet confin d ftri&ly to
7iW/, tis
plain they muft be (bme where : Satan
and all his Legions did not lofe their Exiftcncc*
no, nor the Exiftenee ofD^/fr neither; GOD was
ib r;ir from annihilating him, that he ftill preferv d
his
of the DEVIL. /
his Being 5 and this not Mr. Milton only, but
Gob himfelf has made known to us, having left:
his Hi(lory fo far upon record &amp;gt;
feverai expreffions
in Scripture alfo make it evident, as
particularly
the ftory of Job, mentioned before 3 the like in our
Saviour s time, and feverai others.
If Hell did not immediately ingulph them, as
Milton fuggefts, tis certain, I fay,
that they fled
Somewhere, from the anger of Heaven,from the face
of the Avenger j and his abfence, and their own
guilt, wonder not at /V, would make Hell enough
for them wherever they went.
Nor need we fly
to the Dreams of our dflrorto*
mers, who take a great deal of pains
to fill
up
the vafr.
Spaces of the fhirry Heavens with in
numerable habitable Worlds &amp;gt;
allowing as many
folar Syftems as there are fix d Stars, and that not
only in the known Conitcllations, but even inGW-
laxie it felf ; who, to every fuch Syftem allow a cer
tain number of Planets, and to every one of thofe
PlJnets fo many Satellites or Moons ,
and all thefe
Planets and Moons to be Worlds &amp;gt; folid, dark, o-
I
paque Bodies, habitable, and (as they would have us
believe) inhabited by the like Animals and rational
I
Creatures as on this Earth ; fo that they may, ac
j
this rate, find room enough for the Devil and all
I
his Angels, without making a Hell on purpofe j
I
nay they may, for ought I know, find a World
|
for every Devil in all the Devil s
Hoft, and fo
;
every one may be a Monarch or Mafter~Devil9
\
feparately in his own Sphere or World, and play
; the Devil there by himfelf.
And even if this were fo, it cannot be denied
but that one Devil in a place would be enough
for a whole fyftemary World, and be able, if not
reftrained, to do mifchief enough there too, and
;even to ruin and overthrow the t
whole body of
People contain d in it.
G z But,
*4 The H I ST O R Y
But, I fay,
we need not fly to thefe fhifts, or
contult the Aftronomers in the decifion of this
point 5 for wherever Satan and his defeated Hoft
went, at their expulfion from Heaven^ we think
we are certain, none of all thefe Beautiful Worlds,
or be they Worlds or no, I mean the fix d Stars,
Planets, &V. had then any exiftencej for the Be
ginning, as the Scripture calls it, was not yet
Begun.
But to fpeak a little by the rules of Philofophy,
that is fo fay, fo as to be underflood by others,
even when we fpeak of things we cannot fully
underfland ourfelves: Tho in the Beginning of
Time all this glorious Creation was form d, the
Earth, the (tarry Heavens, and all the Furniture
thereof, and there was a Time when they were
not&amp;gt; yet we cannot fay fo of the Void, or that
namelefs no-tubere^ as I calPd it before, which
now appears to be zfome-where, in which thefe
glorious Bodies are plac d. That immenfe Space
which thofe take up, and which they move in at
this Time, mull: be fuppofed, before they had
Being, to be plac d there: As God himfelf was, and
exiiled before all
Being, Time, or Place, fo the
Heaven of Heavens, or the Place, where the
Thrones and Dominions of his Kingdom then ex-
ifted, inconceivable and ineffable, had an exif-
tence before the glorious Seraphs, the innume
rable company of Angels which attended about
the Throne of God exiiled j thefe all had a Being
long before, as the Eternal Creator of them a3
had before them.
Into this void or abyfs of Nothing, however
unmeafurable, infinite, and even to thofe Spirits,
themfelves Inconceivable, they certainly launch ct
from the bright Precipice which they fell from,
and here they fhifted as well as they could.
Here
of the D E VI L. 85
Here expanding thofe Wings which Fear, and
Horror at their Defeat furnifh d them, as I hint
ed before, they hurried away to the utmoft Di-
llance poflible,
from the Face of GOD their Con
queror, and then moll dreaded Enemy &amp;gt;
formerly
their Joy and Glory.
Be this utmoft remov d Diftance where it will^
Here, certainly, Satan and all his Gang of Devils^
his numberlefs, tho routed Armies retired. Here
Milton might, with fome good Ground, have
form d his Pandemonium^ and have brought them
in, confultihg what was next to be done, and
whether there was any room left to renew the
War, or to carry on the Rebellion ^ but had they
been caft immediately into Hell, clofcdup there, the
Bottomlefs-pit lock d upon them, and the Key
carried up to Heaven to be kept there, as Mr.
Milton himfclf in
part confefles, and the Scripture
affirms ; I fay, had this been fo, the Devil him-
felf could not have been fo ignorant as to think of
any future Steps to be taken, to retrieve his Affairs,
and therefore a Pandemonium or Divan in Hell, to
confult of it, was ridiculous.
All Mr. Milton s Scheme of Satan s future Con
duct, and all the Scripture Expreffions about the
Devil and his numerous Attendants, and of his
actings fince that time, make it not reafonable to
fuggeft that the Devils were confin d to their eter
nal Prifon, at their Expulfion out of Heaven j
But that they were in a State of Liberty to act,
tho limited in afting, of which I fhall alfo fpeak
in its
place.

SEVERAL
things have been fuggefted to fetus
a calculating the number of this frightful
throng of Devil* 9
who with Satan, the Mafler-
Devil, was thus call out of Heaven , I cannot
fay, I am fo much Mailer of Political Arithme-
tick fls to call up the Number of the Beaft, no,
nor the Number of the Beads or Devils, who
inake up this Throng. St. Francis, they tell u,
or fome other Saint, they do not fay who, ask d
the Devil once, how llrong he was ? for St.
Francis, you muft know, was very familiar with
him &amp;gt;
fhe Devil, it feems, did not tell him, but
prefently railed a great Cloud of Dull, by the help,
I
fuppofe, of a Gull of Wind, and bid that Saint
count itj He was, 1
fuppofe, a Calculator, that

Troops into three Lines, caft up the Number of
the Devils of all forts in each Battalia, at ten
hundred times a hundred thoufand millions of the
dl: Line, fifty millions of times as many in the
fecorid Line, and three hundred thoufand times as
manv as both in the third Line.
The Impertinence of this account would hard
ly have given it a place here, only to hint that it
has always been the Opinion, that Satan s Name
nray well be call d a Noun of Multitude, and

considerable Number : It was a fmart Repartee that
a Venetian Nobleman made to a Pried who rallied
him upon his refuting to give fomething to the
Church, which the Pried demanded for the
delivering him from Purgatory 5 when the Pried
asking him, if he knew what an innumerable Num
ber of Devils there were to take him ? he anfwer d,
yes, he knew how many Devils there were in all: How
many ? {ays the Pried, his curiofity, I fuppofc,
being rais d by the novelty of the anfwcr. fPbj

hundred and feventy five Devils and a half, fays
the Nobleman : A half /fays thePricft,^nry what
kind of a Devil is tbat? your felf^ fays the Noble
man, for you are half a Devil already (and will be
a whole one when you come there) for you are for
deluding all you deal with^ and bringing us Soul
and Body into your Hands^
that you may be paid
for letting us go again. So much for their Num
ber.
Here alfo it would come in very aptly, to con-
fider the date of that long interval between the
Time of their Expulfion from Heaven^ and the
Creation of the World ; and what the Poihirc
of the Devil s Affairs might be, during that Time.
The horror of their Condition can only be con-
ceiv d of at a Didance, and efpccially by us, who
being embodied Creatures, cannot fully judge of
what is,
or is not a Punifhment to Seraphs and
Spirits-, But tis jud to fuppofe they fuffer d all
that Spirits
of a Seraphic Nature were capable to
fuftain, confident with their Exiftencej notwith-
ftanding which they retained dill the HeUiflmefs
of their rebellious Principles 5 namely, their Ha
tred and Rage againd God, and their Envy at
the Felicity of his Creatures.
As to how long their time might be, I fhall
leave that Search &amp;gt;
no lights being given me that
G 4 arc
S8 The H I S T O R Y
are cither probable or rational, and we have fo
little room to make a Judgment of it, that we
may as well believe Father M , who fuppofes
it to be a hundred thoufand Years, as thofe who
judge it one thoufand Years ; tis
enough that we
are fure, it was before the Creation, how long be
fore is not material to the Devil s Hiftory^ unlcfs
we had fome Records of what happened
to him,
or was done by him in the Interval.
During the wand ring Condition the Devil was
in at that Time, we mayfuppofe, he and his whole
Clan to be employed in exerting their Hatred and
Rage at the Almighty, and at the Happinefs of
the remaining faithful Angels, by all the ways
they had power to iliew it.
From this determin d Hated Enmity of Satan
and his Hofl again ft GW, and at every thing that
brought Glory to his Name, Mr. Milton brings
in Satan, (whenfirii hefaw Adam vti
Paradife^ and
the Felicity of his Station there) fwelling with
Rage and Envy, and taking up a dreadful Refo-
lution to ruin Mam and all his Pofterity, meer-
ly to difappoint his Maker of the Glory of his
Creation 5 I lhall come to fpeak of that in its
Place.
How Satan, in his remote Situation, got In
telligence of the Place whereto find Adam out,
or that any fuch thing as a Man was created, is
Matter of juft Speculation, and there might be
many rational Schemes laid for it: Mr. Milton
does not undertake to tell us the Particulars, nor
indeed could he find room for it ; perhaps,
the Devil having, as I have fiud, a Liberty to
range over the whole Void or Abyfs, which we
want as well a Name. for, as indeed Powers to
conceive of; might have difcovered that the Al-
mjghty Creator had form d a new and glorious
Work, with infinite Beauty and Variety, filling
i
up
of the DEVIL; S9
up the immenfe Waft of Space, in which he,
(the Devil) and his Angels^
had rov d for fo long
a time, without finding any thing to work on,
or to exert their Apoftate Rage in againft their
Maker.
That at length they found the infinite untrod
den Space, on a Hidden fpread full with glori
ous Bodies, fhining in felf-exifting Beauty, with
a new, and to them unknown Luftre, cali d
Light :
They found thefe luminous Bodies, tho
immenfe in Bulk, and infinite in Number, yet
fixt in their wondrous Stations, regular and exact
in their Motions, confin d in their proper Orbits,
tending to their particular Centers, and enjoying
every one their peculiar Syftems, within which
was contained innumerable Planets with their
Satellites or Moons, in which (again) a reciprocal
Influence, Motion and Revolution confpired to
Form the mod admirable Uniformity of the
whole.
Surprized, to be fure, with this fudden and
yet glorious Work of the Almighty &amp;gt;
for the Cre
ation was enough, with its Luftre, even to fur-
prize the Devils -, they might reafonably be fup-
pofed to ftart out of their dark Retreat, and with
a Curiofity not below the Seraphic Dignity 5 for
thefe are fome of the things which the jfngels de-
fire to look into, to take a flight thro all the ama
zing Syflcms of the fix d Suns or Stars, which
we fee now but at a Diflance, and only make
Ailronomical Guefles at.
Here the Devil found not fubject of Wonder
only, but matter to fwell his revolted Spirit

in the Language of the Devil, as an invafion up
on his Kingdom.
Here it naturally occur d to them, in their
State of Envy and Rebellion, that tho they could
not aflault the impregnable Walls of Heaven^
and could no more pretend to raife War in the
Place of BlefFednefs and Peace &amp;gt;
yet that per
haps they might find Room in this new, and
however glorious, yet inferior Kingdom or Cre
ation, to work fome defpite to their great Crea
tor, or to affront his Majefty in the Pcrfon of
fome of his new made Creatures * and upon this
they may be jufHy fuppofed to double their Vi
gilance, in the furvey they refolve to take of theie
new Worlds, however ercat, numbeiiefs and won
derful.
What Difcoverics they may have made in the
other and greater Worlds, than this Earth, we
have not yet had an account 5 poffibly they are
converfant with other Parts or God s
Creation,
bcfidcs this little little Globe, which is but as
a Point in comparifon of the Rell j and with

according to the Opinion of our Philofophers, in
habit thofe Worlds ; but as no body knows that
Part but the Devil^ we {hall not trouble our felves
with the Enquiry.
Rut tis
very rcafonable, and indeed probable,
that the Devils were more than ordinarily fur-
priz d at the Nature and Reafon of all this
glo
rious Creation, after they had, with the utmoft
Curiofity, view d all the parts of it 5 The Glories
of the feveral Syftems; the immenfe fpaces iu
which thofe glorious Bodies that were created and
made part of it, were allow d refpe&ively to move &amp;gt;
the innumerable fix d Stars, as fo many Suns in

many diftant Solar Syflems-, the

(likewife innumerable) dark opaque Bodies recei
ving light, and depending upon thofc Suns re-
fpetively for fuch light, and then reflecting that
light again upon and tor the Ufe of one another ;
To fee the Beauty and Splendor of their Forms,
the Regularity of their Pofition, the Order and
Exactnefs, and yet inconcievable Velocity of their
Motions, the certainty of their Revolutions, and
the Variety and Virtue of their Influences &amp;gt;
and
then, which was even to the Devils themfelves
moil aflonifhing, That after all the red of their
Obfervations they fhould find this whole immenfe
Work was adapted for, and made fubfervient to
the Ufe, Delight and Blefling only of one poor
Species, in iticlf fmall, and in Appearance con
temptible -,
the meaner! of all the Kinds fuppo-
fcd to inhabit fomany glorious Worlds, as appear
ed now to be form d -&amp;gt;
I mean, that Moon call d the
Earth, and the Creature call d Man 5 that all was
made for him, upheld by the wife Creator, on his
account only, and would necefTarily end an4
ceaie whenever that Species {hould end and be
dctermin d.
That this Creature was to be found no where
but (as above) in one little individual Moon-,*. Spot
leis than almofh any of the Moons, which were in
fuch great Numbers to be found attendant upon,
and prefcrib d with in every Syftem of the whole
created Heavens 5 This was aftontfhing even to
the Devil himfelf, nay the whole Clan of Devils
could fcarce entertain any juft Ideas of the thing j
Till at laft Satan^ indefatigable in his Search or En
quiry into the Nature and Reafon of this new
Work, and particularly fearching into the Spe
cies of Man, whom he found God had thus
plac d in the little Globe, call d Earth; he foon
came to an Eclairiciffement^ or a clear Underftand-
ing of the whole. For Example^
Firft,
9 z The HI ST O R Y
He found this Creature, call d Man,
was however mean and fmall in his Appea
rance, a kind of a Seraphic Species j that he
was made in the very Image of God, endow
ed with reafonable Faculties to know Good
and Evil, and poiTefs d of a certain thing till
then unknown and unheard of even in Hell it
felf ; that is,
in the Habitation of Devils, let
that be where it would, (viz.)
. That GOD had made him indeed of the low-
eft and coarfeft Materials, but that he had
breath d into him the Breath of Life, and
that he became a living thing call d SOUL,
being a kind of an extraordinary heavenly
and divine Emanation 3 and confequently
that Man, however mean and Terrefinal
his Body might be, was yet, Heaven-born,
in his fpirituous Part compleatly Seraphic j
and after a Space of Life here, (determined
to be a ftate of probation) he fhould be tranf-
latcd thro the Regions of Death into a Life
purely and truly Heavenly, and which fhould
remain fo for ever 5 being capable of knowing
and enjoying God his Maker, and (landing
in his Pretence, as the glorified Angels do.
. That he had the moll fublime Faculties infu-
fed into him 5 was capable not only of know
ing and contemplating God, and which was
ilill more, of enjoying him, as above , but
(which the Devil now was not) capable of
honouring and glorifying his Maker &amp;gt;
who
nlfo had condeicended to accept of Ho
nour from him.
.
And which was flill more, that being of an
Angelic Nature, tho mix d with, and con-
fin d for the prefent in a Cafe of mortal
Flefli j he was intended to be removed from
this
of the D E V I L. 9 j
this Earth after a certain time of Life here,
to inhabit that Heaven, and enjoy that very
Glory and Felicity, from which Satan and his
Angels had been expell d.
When he found all this, it
prefently occur d
to him, that God had done it all as an aft of
Triumph over him (Satan,) and that thefe Crea
tures were only created to people Heaven, depo
pulated or ftript of its inhabitants by his Expul-
fion, and that thefe were all to be made Angels in
the Devil s ftead.
If this thought encreas d his Fury and Envy,
as far jas Rage of Devils can be capable of being
made greater &amp;gt;
it doubtlefs fet him on work to
give a Vent to that Rage and Envy, by fearching
into the Nature and Conftitution of this Crea
ture, calPd Man &amp;gt;
and to find out whether he
was invulnerable, and could by no means be hurt
by the Power of Hell, or deluded by his Sub-
tilty 3 or whether he might be begun&quot;
d and delu
ded, and fo, inftead of being prelerv d in Holi-
nefs and Purity, wherein he was certainly crea
ted, be brought to fall and rebell as he (Satan)
had done before him &amp;gt;
by which, inftead of be
ing tranfplanted into a glorious State, after this
Life in Heaven, as his Maker had defign d him
to be, to fill
up the Angelic Choir, and fup-
ply the Place from whence he (Satan) had fallen,
he might be made to fall alfo like him, and in a
Word, be made a Devil like himfelf.
This convinces us that the Devil has not loft
his natural Powers by his Fall; and our learned
Commentator Mr. Pool is of the fame Opinion j
tho he grants that the Devil has loft his moral
Power, or his Power of doing Good, which he
can never recover. Tide Mr. Pool upon Afts
xix. 17. where we may particularly obferve^
when
94 The H I S T O R Y
when the Man poflefs
d with an evil Spirit
flew upon the feven Sons of Swua the Jew^
who would have Exorcis d them in the Name
of Jeftts, without the Authority of Jefus9
or
without Faith in him &amp;gt;
He flew on them and maf-
ter d them, fo that they fled out of the Houfe
from the Devil conquered, naked and wounded :
But of this Power of the Devil I fhall fpeak bv
it felf.
In a Word, and to fum up all the Devil s
Story
from his firft Expulfion, it Hands thus : For fa
many Years as were between his Fall and the Cre
ation of Man, tho we have no Memoirs of his par
ticular Affairs, we have Reafon to believe he was
without any Manner of Employment j but a cer
tain tormenting Endeavour to be always expref-
fing his
Rage and Enmity again ft Heaven 3 1 call
it
tormenting, Becaufe ever difappointed $ every
thought about it
proving empty j every attempt
towards it abortive j Leaving him only Light
enough to lee ftill more and more Reafon to de-
fpair of Succefs j and that this made his Condi
tion ftill more and more a Hell than it was be
fore.
After a Space of Duration in this Mifery, which
we have no light given us to meafure or judge
of, He at
length difcover d the new Creation of
Man, as above, upon which he foon found Mat
ter to fet himielf to work upon, and has been
bufily em ploy d ever fincc.
And now indeed there may be room to fug-
geft a Local /&//, and the Confinement of Souls
(made corrupt and degenerate by him) to it, as a
Place &amp;gt;
tho he himfelf, as is ftill
apparent by his
Aftings, is not yet confin d to it -,
of this Hell,
its
Locality, Extent, Dimenfions, Continuance
and Nature, as it docs not belong to Satan s
Hiftory, I have a good excufe for faying nothing,
and
of the DEVIL; $*
and.fo put off my meddling with that, which if
I would meddle with, I could fay nothing of to
the Purpofe.

Of the &quot;Power
of the Devil at the Time of
the Creation of this World ; whether it
has not been farther ftraitn d and limited
Jince that Time, and what Shifts andStra

CUnning
Men have fabled, and tho it be
without either Religion, Authority or phy-
fical Foundation, it
may be we may like it ne er
the worfefor that} that when God made the Stars
and all the Heavenly Luminaries, the Devil, to
mimick his Maker and infult his new Creation,
made Comets, in Imitation ofthe fix d Stars ; but
that the Compofition of them being combufti-
ble, when they came to wander in the Abyfs, rol
ling by an irregular ill-grounded Motion, they
took Fire, in their Approach tofome of thofe great
Bodies of Flame, the fix d Stars &amp;gt;
and being thus
kindled (like a Fire-work unskilfully let off) they
then took wild and excentrick, as alfo different
Motions of their own, out of Satan s Dire&ion,
and beyond his Power to regulate ever after.
Let this Thought itand by it felf5
it matters not
to our purpofe whether we believe any thing of
it, or no 5 tis
enough to our Cafe, that if Satan
had any fuch Power then, he has no fuch Power
now, and that leads me to enquire into his more
recent Limitations,
I am
$6 The HI STORY
I am to fuppofe, he and all his Accomplices
being confounded at the Difcovery of the new
Creation, and racking their Wits to find out the
meaning of it, had at lafl (no matter how) difco^
ver d the whole Syftem, and concluded, as I have
faid, that the Creature, caWd Man, was to be
their SuccefTor in the Heavenly Manfions j upon
which I fuggeft that the firft Motion ofHell was
to deftroy this new Work, and, if poffible, to
overwhelm it.
But when they came to make the Attempt, they
found their Chains were not long enough, and that
they could not reach to the Extremes ofthe Syftem :
They had no Power either to break the Order, or
ftop the Motion, diflocate the Parts, or confound
the Situation of Things 5 they traverfed, no doubt,
the whole Work, vifited every Star, landed upon
every Solid, and fail d upon every Fluid in the whole
Scheme, to fee what Mifchief they could do.
Upon a long and full Survey, they came to this
Point in their Enquiry, that in fhort they could
do nothing by Force 3 that they could not dif-
place any Part, annihilate any Atom, or deftroy
any Life in the whole Creation ; but that as Om
nipotence had created it, fo the fame Omnipotence
had arm d it at all Points againft the utmoft Power
of Hell, had made the fmalleft Creature in it invul
nerable, as to Satan ; fo that without the Permiffion
of the fame Power which had made Heaven, and
conquered the Devil, he could do nothing at all, as
to deftroying any thing that God had made, no,
not the little diminutive thing call d Man, who
Satan faw fo much reafon to hate, as
being created
to fucceed him in Happinefs in Heaven.
Satan found him placed out of his Power to hurt,
or out of his Reach to touch 5 and here, by the
way, appears the fecond Conqueft of Heaven over
the Devil; that having pluc d his Rival, as ic
were
of the D E V I L. 97
were, juft before his Face, and fhew d the hate
ful %ht to him, he faw written upon his Image,
Touch him if you dare.
*It cannot be doubted, bur, had it not been thus,
Man is fo fir from being a Match for the J)evil9
that one of Satan s leaft
Imps or Angels could deftroy
all the Race of them in the World, ay World
and all in a moment j
As he is Prince of the Power of the Air, taking
the Air for the Elementary World,
how eafily could
he, atoneBlaft, fweep all the Surface of the Earth
into the Sea, or drive weighty immenfe Surges of
the Ocean over the whole Plane of the Earth, and
deluge the Globe at once with a Storm ? Or how
eafily could he, who, by the Situation of the Em
pire, mull be fuppofed able to manage the Clouds,
draw them up, in fuch Pofition as fhould natu
rally produce Thunders and Lightnings, caufethofe
Lightnings to blaft the Earth, dafli in Pieces all the
Buildings, burn all the populous Towns and Ci
ties, and lay wait the World 5
At the fame time he might command fuited
Quantities of fublimated Air to burft out of the
Bowels of the Earth, and overwhelm and fwailow
up, in the opening Chafms, all the Inhabitants %L
of the Globe?
In a Word, Satan left to himfelf as a Devil,
and to the Power, which by virtue of his Sera
phic Original he mult be veiled with, was able to
have made Devilifli Work in the World, if by a
fuperior Power he was not reftrain d.
But there is no doubt, at haft to we, but that
with his fall from Heaven, as he loft the Recti
tude and Glory of his Angelic Nature, 1 mean
his Innocence, fo he loft the Power too that he
had before -
y and that when he fir ft commenced
Devil, he received the Chains of Reftraint too,
as the Badge of his Apoftacy, viz. a general Pro-
H hibition,
98 The HISTORY
hibition, to do any thing to the Prejudice of
this Creation, or to aft any thing by Force or
Violence without fpecial Permiffion.
This Prohibition was not fent him by a Mef-
fenger, or by an Order in Writing, or proclaimed
from Heaven by a Law ; but Satan^ by a ftrange,
invifible and unaccountable Imprefiion felt the
Reftraint within him ; and at the fame time that
his moral Capacity was not taken away, yet his
Power of exerting that Capacity felt the Rc-
ftraint, and left him unable to do, even what he
was able to do at the fame time.
I make no queftion, but the Devil is fenfiblc of
this Reilraintj that is to fay, not as it is a reftraint
only, or as an effeft of his Expulfion from Hea
ven ; But as it
prevents his Capital Defign againft
Man, who, for the Reafon I have given already,
he entertains a mortal Hatred of, and would de-
ftroy with all his Heart, if he might ; and therefore,
like a chain d MaflifF, we find him oftentimes
making a horrid hellifli Clamour and Noife, bark
ing and howling, and frighting the People, letting
them know, that if he was loofe he would tear them
in pieces ; but at the fame time his very Fury {hakes
his Chain, which lets them know, to their Satis
faction, he can only Bark, but cannot Bite.
Some are of Opinion that the Devil is not re-
ftrain d fo much by the fuperior Power of his So
vereign and Maker; but that all his milder Mea-
fures with Man are the effeft ofa political Scheme,
and done upon mature Deliberation ; that it was
refolved to aft thus, in the great Council or P 1
of Devils, call d upon this very Occafion, when
they firft were informed of the Creation of Man;
and efpecially when they confidered what kind
of Creature he was, and what might probably
be the Reafon of making him, (viz.) to fill
up
the Vacancies in Heavens I fay, that then the
4 Devils
of the DEVIL. 99
Devils refolv d, that it was not for their Inte-
reft to fall
upon him with Fury and Rage, and
fo deftroy the Species, for that this would be no
Benefit at all to them, and would only caufe ano
ther original Man to be created 5 for that they
knew GOD could, by the fame Omnipotence,
form as many new Species of Creatures as he
pleafed 5 and, if he thought fit, create them in
Heaven too, out of the Reach of Devils or evil
Spirits, and that therefore, to deftroy Man would
no way anfwer their End.
On the other hand, examining ftrictly the
Mould of this new made Creature, and of what
Materials he was form d &amp;gt;
how mixt up of a Nature
convertible and pervertible, capable indeed of
infinite Excellence, and confequently of eternal
Felicity &amp;gt;
but fubjecl: likewife to Corruption and
Degeneracy, and confequently to eternal Miferyj
That inftead of being fit to fupply the Places of
Satan and hisrejefted Tribe (the expelPd Angels)
in Heaven, and filling up the Thrones or Stalls in
the Geleftial Choir, they might, if they could but
be brought into Crime, become a Race of Re
bels and Traytors like the reft &amp;gt;
and fo come at laft
to keep them Company, as well in the Place of
eternal Mifery, as in the Merit of it, and in a
Word, become Devils inftead of Angels.
Upon this Difcovery, I fay, they found it infi
nitely more for the Intereft of Satan s infernal
Kingdom, to go another way to work with Man
kind, and fee if it were poffiWe, by the ftrength
of all their infernal Wit and Counfels, to lay
fome Snare for him, and by fome Stratagem to
bring him to eternal Ruin and Milery.
This being then approved as their only Method,
(and the D*w7ihew d he was no Fool in the Choice)
he next refolv d that there was no time to be loft
-
9
that it was to be fet about immediately3
before the
H 4 Race
ioo The HISTORY
Race was Multiplied, and by that means the
Work be not made greater only, but perhaps the
more difficult too ; accordingly the diligent Devil
went inftantly about it, agreeably to all the Story
of Eve and the ferpent, as before &amp;gt;
the belief of
which, whether historically or allegorically, is not
at all obftru&ed by this Hypothecs.
I do not affirm that this was the Cafe at n*rn%
becaufe being not prefent in that black Di-van^
at lead not that I know of, for who knows where
be was or was not in his pre-exiftent State ? I can
not be pofitive in the Refolve that pail there j
but except for fome very little Contradiction,
which we find in the facred Writings, I fhouLd,
I confefs, incline to believe it
Hiftorically j and I
fhall fpeak of thofe things which I call Contra
dictions to it more largely hereafter. &amp;gt;
In the mean time, be it one way or other, that
is to fay&amp;gt;
either that Satan had no Power to have
proceeded with Man by Violence, and to have de-
uroy d him as foon as he was made &amp;gt;
or that he
had the Power, but chofe rather to proceed by
other Methods to deceive and debauch himj /
fay^ be it which you pleafe, I am ilill of the Opi
nion that it
really was not the Devil s Bufinefs
to deftroy the Species 5 that it would have been
nothing to the purpofe, and no Advantage at all
to him, if he had done it j for that, as above,
GOD could immediately have created another Spe
cies to the fame end, whom he either could have
made invulnerable, and not fubject to the Devil s
Power, or remov d him out of Satan s Reach,
plac d him out of the Devil s Ken, in Heaven or
fome other Place, where the Devil could not
come to hurt him ; and that therefore it is infi
nitely more his Advantage, and more fuited to
his real
Defign of defeating the End of Man s Cre
ation, to debauch hint and make a Devil of him,
that
of the DEVIL. 101
that he may be rejefted like himfelf, and increafe
the infernal Kingdom and Company in the Lake
of Mifery In sternum.
It may be true, for
ought I know, that Satan
,-has not the Power of Definition put into his
Hand, and that he cannot take away the Life of a
Man : and it feems probable to be fo, from the
Story ofSatan and Job^ when Satan appeared among
the Sons of GOD, as the Text fays, Job i. 6. Now
when God gave fuch a Character of Job to him,
and ask d him if he bad confider d bis Servant
Job, f. 8. why did not the Devil ,go immedi
ately and exert his Malice againft the good
Man at once, to let his Maker fee what would
become of his Servant Job in his Diftrefs? On the
contrary, we fee he only anfwers by ihewing the
Reafon of Job s
good Behaviour j that it was but
common Gratitude for the Bleffing and Prote&ion
he enjoy d, f 10. and pleading that if his Eftate
was taken away, and he was exposed as he (Satan)
was, to be a beggar and a
Vagabond, going to and
fro in the Earth, and walking up and down therein,
he fhould be a very Devil too, like himfelf, and
curfe God to his Face.
Upon this, the Text fays, that Godanfwered ir.
1 1 . Behold all that he hath is in thy Power &amp;gt;
now tis
plain here, that God gave up Job s Wealth and
Eftate, nay his Family, and the Lives of his Chil
dren and Servants into the Devils Power 5 and
accordingly, like a true mercilefs Devil, as he is,
he deftroy d them all ; he mov d the Sabeans
to fall
upon the Oxen and the AfTes, and carry
them off} he mov d the Chaldeans to fall
upon the
Camels and the Servants, to carry off the firft,
and murther the laft 5 he made Lightning flafh
upon the poor Sheep, and kill them all -&amp;gt;
and he
blow d his Houfe down upon his
poor Children,
and buried them all in the Ruins.
H 3 Now
102 The HISTORY
Now here is
(i .)
a Specimen of Satan s
good
Will to Mankind, and what Havock the Devil
would make in the World, if he might-, and here
is a Teftimony too, that he could not do this
without leave , fo that I cannot but be of the Opi
nion he has fome Limitations, fome Bounds fet to
his natural Fury j a certain Number of Links in
his Chain, which he cannot exceed, or, in a
Word, that he cannot go a Foot beyond his
fetter.
The fame kind of Evidence we have in the
Gofpel, Matth. viii.
31. where Satan could not
fo much as poflcfs the filthieft and meaneft of all
Creatures, the Svjine^ till he had ask d leave &amp;gt;
and
that ftill,
to fliew his good Will, as foon as he
had gotten leave, he hurried them all into the Sea
and choak d them &amp;gt;
thefe, I fay, are fome of the
Rcafons why I am not willing to fay, the Devil
is not reftrain d in Power $ but on the other fide,
we are told of fo many mifchievous things the Devil
has done in the World, by virtue of his Domini
on over the Elements, and by other Teftimonies
of his Power, that I don t know what to think
of it 5 tho , upon the whole, the firft is the fafeft
Opinion
-
y for if we fliould believe the la ft, we
might, for ought I know, be brought, like the
American Indians^ to worfhip him at laft&amp;gt;
that he
may do us no Harm.
And now I have nam d thofe People in Ame-
rica^ I confefs it would go a great way in favour
of Satan s
Generofity, as well as in Teftimony of
his Power, if we might believe all the Accounts,
which indeed Authors are pretty well agreed in
the Truth of, namely, of the Mifchicfs the Devil
does in thofe Countries, where his Dominion feems
to be eftablifh d j how he ufes them when they
deny him the Homage he claims of them as his
Due 3 what Havock and Combuftion he makes
among
ofthe DEVIL; 103
among them 3 and how Beneficent he is
(or at
lead negative in his Mifchiefs) when they Appeafe
him by their hellith Sacrifices.
Likewife we fee a Teft of his wicked Subtilty
in his Management of thofe dark Nations, when
he was more immediately worfhip d by them ;
namely, the making them believe that all their
good Weather, Rains, Dews, and kind Influences
upon the Earth, to make it fruitful, was from Him 5
whereas they really were the common Bleflmgs of
a higher Hand, and came not from him, theZVi;//,
but from him that made the Devi/^ and made him
a Devil or fallen Angel by his Curie.
But to go back to the Method the Devil took
with the fir ft of Mankind 3 tis
plain the Policy of
Hell was right, tho the Execution of the Re-
folves they took did not fully anfwer their End
neither 3 For Satan fattening upon poor, proud, ri
diculous Mother Eve, as I have faid before, made
prefently a true Judgment of her Capacities, and
of her Temper 3 took her by the right Handle,
and foothing her Vanity (which is to this Day
the fofteft Place in the Head of all the Sex)
wheedl d her out of her Senfes, by prailing her
Beauty, and promiiing to make her a Goddefs.
The foolifh Woman yielded prefently, and that
we are told is the Reafon why the fame Method fo
flrangely takes with all her Pofterity (viz.) that you
are fore to prevail with them, if
you can but once
perfuade them that you believe they are Witty and
Handfome 3 for the Devil, you may obfervc, never
quits any Hold he gets, and having once found a
way into the Heart, always takes care to keep
the Door open, that any of his Agents may en
ter after him without any more Difficulty: Hence
the fame Argument, efpecially the lair, has fo be-
witching an Influence on the Sex, that they rarely
deny you any thing, after
they are but weak
H 4 enough
104 The H I ST O R Y
enough and vain enough to accept of the Praifcs you
offeAhem on that Head; on the other hand you
are fure they never forgive you the unpardonable
Crime of faying they are Ugly or Difagreeable : It is
fuggefled that the firfl: Method the Devil took to
inunuate all thofe fine things into Eve s
giddy
Head, was by creeping dole to her one Night,
\vhen fhe was afleep, and laying his Mouth to her
Ear^ whilpcring all the fine things to her, which
he knew would fet her Fancy a Tip-toe, and fo
made her receive them involuntarily into her Mind &amp;gt;
knowing well enough that when fhe had form d
fuch Ideas in her Soul, however they came there,
fhe would never be quiet till fhe had work d them
up to fome extraordinary thing or other.
It was evident what the Devil zim d at, namely,
that fhe fhould break in upon the Command of
GOD, and fo having corrupted her felf, bring
the Curfe upon her felf and all her Race, as GOD
had threatn d &amp;gt;
but why the Pride of Eve fnould
be fo eafily
tickled by the Motion of her exquifite
Beauty, when there then was no profpect of the
ufe or want of thofe Charms ? that indeed makes
a kind of Difficulty here, which the Icarn d have
not determined. For,
I . If fhe had been as
Ugly as the Devil, fhe had
no body to rival her, fo that fhe need not
fear Adam fhould leave her and ^et another
&quot;Miflrefs.
z. If fhe had been Bright and Beautiful as an
Angel, flie had no other Admirer but poor
Mam, and he could have no room to be jea
lous of her, or afraid fhe fhould cuckold
him 5 fo that in fhort, Eve had no fuch Oc-
cafion for her Beauty, nor could fhe make any
ufe of it either to a bad purpofeor to a good,
and therefore I believe the Devi^ who is too
cunning
of the D JE V I L. 105
cunning to do any thing that fignifies
No
thing, rather tempted her by the Hope of
encreafing her Wit, than her Beauty.
But to come back to the Method of Satan s
tempting her, viz.by whifpering to her in her ileep j
twas a cunning Trick, that s the Truth of it, and
by that means he certainly fet her Head a madding
alter Deifm, and to be made a Goddefs, and then
back d it by the fubtle talk he had with her af
terward.
I am the more particular upon this Part, be-
caufe, however the Devil may have been the firft
that ever practifed it.
yet I can aflure him the
Experiment has been tried upon many a Woman
fince, to the wheedling her out of her Modefty,
as well as her Simplicity j and the Cunning Men
tell us ftill, that if you can come at a Woman when
fheis in a deep fleep, and Whifper to her clofe to
her Ear, {he will certainly Dream of the Thing
you fay to her, and fo will a Man too.
Well, be this fo to her Race or not, it was it
feems fo to her; for {he wak d with her Head fill d
with pleafing Ideas, and as fome will have it, un
lawful Defires &amp;gt;
fuch, as to be fure {he never had
entertain d before , Thefe are fuppofed to be fatally
infufed in her Dream, and fuggeiled to her waking
Soul, when the Organ Ear which convey d them
was doz d and infenfible; flrange Fate of fleeping
in
Paradife ! that whereas we have Notice but of
two Sleeps there, that in one a PFoman {hould
go out of him, and in the other, the Devil {hould
come into her.
Certainly, when Satan fir ft made the Attempt
upon Eve, he did not think he fhould have fo
ealily conquered her, or have brought his Bufinels
about fo foon 5 the Devil himfelf could not have
imagined {he {hould have been fo foon brought
to
io6 The HIS TORY
to forget the Command given,
or at leaft who
gave it, and have ventured to tranfgrcfs againil
him, and made her forget that GOD had told her, it
fhould be Death to her to touch it j and above
all, that {he fhould afpirc to be as wife as him,
who was fo ignorant before, as to believe it was
for fear of her being like himfclf, that he had for
bid it her.
Well might {he be faid to be the weaker Vei-
fel, tho Adam himfelf had little enough to fay
for his being the ftronger of the two, when he
was over-perfuaded (if it were doneby Perfuafion)
by his Wife to do the fame thing.
And mark how wife they were after they had
Eaten, and what Fools they both acted like, even
to one another 5 nay, even all the Knowledge
they attam d toby it was, for ought I fee, only to
know that they were Fools, and to be fenfible
both of Sin and Shame j and fee how (imply they
a6ted, I fay, upon their having committed the
Crime, and being detected in it.
c
View them to Day converfing with their God,

His Image both enjoy d and underftood,
c
fo Morrow skulking with a fordid Flight, ^
c
Among the Buflies from the Infinite^ (Sight 5
&amp;gt;
c
As if that Power was blind^ which gave them J

of the DEVIL. 107
But thus encroaching Crime dethrones the Senfe,
*
And intercepts the Heavenly Influence,
4
Debauches Reafon, makes the Man a Fool,
4
And turns his aftive Light to Ridicule.
It muftbe confefs d that it was unaccountable De
generacy, even of their common Reafoning, which
Adam and Eve both fell into upon the fir 11 com
mitting the Offence of taking the forbidden
Fruit : If that was their being made as Gods,
it made but a poor Appearance in its fidl coming,
to hide their Nakednels when there was no body
to fee them, and cover themfelves among the
Bufhes from their Maker) but thus it was, and
this the Devil had brought them to, and well
might he, and all the Clan of Hell, as Mr. Mil
ton brings them in, laugh and triumph over the
Man after the Blow was given, as
having fo egre-
gioufly abufed and deluded them both.
But here, to be fure, began the Devil s new-
Kingdom $ as he had now feduc d the two firft
Creatures, he was pretty fure of Succefs upon all
the Race, and therefore prepared to attack them
alfo, as foon as they came on 5 nor was their en-
creafing Multitude any Difcouragcment to his At
tempt, but juil the contrary j for he had Agents
enough to employ, if every Man and Woman
that fhould be born was to want a Devil to wait
upon them, feparately and fingly to feduce them 5
whereas fome whole Nations have been fuch
willing fubjects to him, that one of his Seraphic
Imps may, for ought we know^ have been enough
to guide a whole Country \ the People being en
tirely fubje&ed to his Government for many Ages 5
as in America^ for example, where fome will have
it, that he convey d the firil Inhabitants, at leaft
if
io8 The HI S T O R Y
if he did not, we don t well know who did, of
how they got thither.
And how came all the Communication to be fo
entirely cut off between the Nations of Europe and
Africa, from whence America mull certainly have
been peopl d, or elfe the Devil muft have done it
indeed ? I fay, how came the Communication to
be fo entirely cut off between them, that except
the time, whenever if was, that People did at
firft reach from one to the other, none ever came
back to give their Friends any account of their
Succefs5
or invite them to follow? Nor did they hear
of one another afterwards, as we have Reafon to
think: Did Satan politically keep them thusafun-
der, left News from Heaven fhould reach them,
and fo they fhould be recover d out of his Govern
ment ? We cannot tell how to give any other rational
Account of it, that a Nation, nay a Quarter of the
World, or as fome will have it be, halfthe Globe,
fhould be peopled from Europe or Africa, or both,
and no body ever go after them, or come back
from them in above three thoufand years after.
Nay, that thofe Countries fhould be peopled
when there was no Navigation in ufe in thefe
Parts of the World, no Ships made that could
carry Provifions enough to fupport the People
that fail d in them, but that they mud have been
ilarved to death before they could reach the Shore
o America; the Ferry from Europe or Africa, in
any Part ( which we have known Navigation to
be pradbifed in) being at leaft 1000 Miles, and in
moft Places much more.
But as to the Americans, let the Devi? and they
alone to account for their
coming Thither, this we
are certain of, that we knew nothing of them for
many hundred Years $ and when we did, when the
Difcovery was made, they that went from Hence
found Satan in* faH and quiet PoiTeflion of them,
ruling
of the D EVIL. 109
ruling them with an arbitrary Government, parti
cular to himfelf-
y He had led them into a blind Sub-
jedion to himfelf, nay, I
might call it
Devotion, for
it was all of Religion that was to be found among
them) worfhipping horrible Idols in his Name, to
whom he directed human Sacrifices
continually to
be made, till he deluged the Country with Blood,
and ripen d them up for the Deftru&ion that fol-
low d, from the Invalion of the Spaniards, who he
knew would hurry them all out of the World as
faft as he (the Devil) himfelf could defire of them.
But to go back a little to the Original of Things,
It is evident that Satan has made a much better
Market of Mankind, by thus fubtilly attacking
them, and bringing them to break with their
Maker as he had done before them, than he could
have done by fulminating upon them at firlr, and
fending them all out of the World at once &amp;gt;
for
now he has peopled his own Dominions with
them, and tho a Remnant are fnatch d as it were
out of his Clutches, by the Agency of Invinci
ble Grace, of which I am not to difcourfe in this
Place ; yet this may be faid of the Devil, with
out Offence, that he has in fome Senie carried his
Point, and as it were forc d his Maker to be fa-
tisfied with a Part of Mankind, and the lead
Part too, inftead of the great Glory he would have
brought to himfelf by keeping them all in his
Service.
Mr. Milton, as I have noted above, brings in
the Devil and all Hell with him, making a Feu
de Joye for the Viftory Satan obtain d over one
filly Woman &amp;gt;
indeed it was a Piece of Succefs
greater in its
Confequence than in the immediate
Appearance 5 nor was the
Conqueft fo
compleat
as Satan himfelf imagin d to make, fince the Pro-
mife of a
Redemption out of his Hands, which
was immediately made to the Man, in behalf of
himfelf
no The HISTORY
himfelf and his believing Pofterity, was a great
Difappointment to Satan, and as it were fnatch d
the beft Part of his Victory out of his Hands.
It is certain the Devils knew what the mean
ing of that Promife was, and who was to be the
Seed of the Woman^ namely, the incarnate Son of
God) and that it was a fecond Blow to the whole
infernal Body 3 but as if they had refolved to
let that alone, Satan went on with his Bufi-
nefs &amp;gt;
and as he had introduc d Crime into the
common Parent of Mankind, and thereby fecu-
red the Contamination of Blood, and the De-
fcent or Propagation of the corrupt Seed, he had
nothing to do but to affift Nature in time to come,
to carry on its own Rebellion, and act it felf in the
Breads of Eve s tainted Pofterity &amp;gt;
and that in
deed has been the Devil s Bufinefs ever iince his
firft Victory upon the Kind, to this Day.
His Succefs in this Part has been fuch, that
jye fee upon innumerable Occafions a general De-
*&quot;
etion has followed &amp;gt;
a kind of a Taint upon Na
ture, call it what you will, a Blaft upon the Race of
Mankind ; and were it not for one thing,he had ruin
ed the whole Family; I fay, were it not for one
thing, namely, a felected Company or Number,
which his Maker has refolv d he fhall not be able to
corrupt, or ifhe does, the fending the promised Seed
ihall recover back again from him, by the Power of
irrefiftible Grace 5 which Number thus feleftedor
ele&ed, call it which we will, are ftill to fupply
the Vacancies in Heaven, which Satan s Defe6tion
left open &amp;gt;
and what was before filPd up with crea
ted Seraphs, is now to be reftor d by recovered
Saints, by whom infinite Glory is to accrue to
the Kingdom of the Redeemer.
This glorious Eftabliihment has robb d Satan
of all the Joy of his
Victory, and left him juft
where he was, defeated and difappointed &amp;gt;
nor
does
of the DEVIL. in
does the Pofleffion of all the Myriads of the Sons
of Perdition, who yet fome are of the Opinion
will be fnatch d from him too at laftj I fay, the
PolTeilion of all thefe makes no amends to him,
for he is fuch a Devil in his Nature, that the Envy
at thofe he cannot feduce, eats out all the Satis-
fa&ion of the Mifchief he has done in feducing all
the reft &amp;gt;
but / mujl not preachy fo I return to
things as much needful to know, tho lefs folemn.
CHAP. IX.
Of the Progrefs of Satan in carrying on his
Conqueft over Mankind, from the Fall of
Eve to the Deluge.
I
Doubt if the Devil was ask d the Queftion
plainly, he would confefs, that after he had con-
quer d Eve by his own wicked Contrivance, and
then by her Afliftance had brought Adam too (like
a Fool as he was) into the fame Gulph of Mifery,
he thought he had done his Work, compared the
whole Race, that they were now his own, and
that he had put an End to the grand Defign of
their Creation $ namely, of Peopling Heaven with
a new Angelic Race of Souls, who when glori-
fy d, (hould make up the Defection of the Hod
of Hell, that had been expung d by their Crime j
in a Word, that he had gotten a better Conqueft
than if he had deftroy d them all.
But in the midft of his Conqueft, he found
a Check put to the Advantages he expected to
reap from his Victory, by the immediate Promifo
of Grace to a Part of the Pofterity of ddam^
who, notwithftanding the Fall, were to be purcha-
fed by the MeJJiah^ and fnatch d out of his (Satan s)
Hand?,
The HI ST O R Y
Hands, and over whom he could make no final
Conqueft 3 fo that his Power met with a new
Limitation, and that fuch, as indeed fully
dif
ap
pointed him in the main thing he aim d at, (viz.)
preventing the Beatitudes of Mankind, which
were thus fecur dj (And what if the Numbers of
Mankind were upon this account cncreated in
fuch a manner, that the fele6ted Number iliould,
by Length of Time, amount to juffc
as many as
the whole Race, had they not fallen, would have
amounted to in all?) And thus, indeed, the World
may be faid to be upheld and continued for the
Sake of thofe few, fince till their Number can
be compleated, the Creation cannot fall, any more
than, that without them, or but for them it would
not have flood.
But leaving this Speculation, and not having
enquir d of Satan what he has to fay on that Sub-
&quot;jecl:,
let us go back to the Antediluvian World :
The Devil to be furc, gain d his Point upon Eve^
and in her upon all her Race : He drew her into
Sin j got her turned out of Paradife, and the
Man with her: The next Thing was to go to
work with her Pofterity, and particularly with
her two Sons Cain and dbel-
Adam having, notwith ftand ing his Fall, repent
ed very fincerely of his Sinj receiv d the Promife
of Redemption and Pardon, with an humble but
believing Heart -,
Charity bids us fuppofe that
he led a very religious and fober Life ever after &amp;gt;
and efpecially in the firit Part of his Time, That
he brought up his Children very foberly, and gave
them all the neccflary Advantages of a Religious
Education,and a good Introduction into the World,
that he was capable of &amp;gt;
and that Eve likewife
afllfted to both in her Place and Degree.
Their two elded Sons Cain and Abel-, The one
Heir apparent to the Patriarchal Empire, and the
4 other
oftheVEVl L. 113
other Heir prefumptive, I
fuppofealfo, lived very
lober and religious Lives &amp;gt;
and as the Principles of
natural Religion dictated a
Homage and Subjecti
on due to the Almighty Maker, as an Acknow
ledgment of his Mercies, and a Recognition of
their Obedience 5 ib thereceiv d Ufage of Religi
on dictating at that Time that this Homage was to
be paid by a Sacrifice, they either of them brought
a Free-will-offering to be dedicated to God re-
fpectively for themfelves and Families,
How it was, and for what Reafon that God
had refpect to the Offering of Abel^ which the
Learn d fay, was a, Lamb of the Firfilings of the
Flock, and did not give any Teflimony ofthe like
Refpect to Cain and his Offering, which was of the
fir ft Fruits of the Earth, the Offerings being equal
ly fuited to the refpective Employment of the
Men, that is not my prefent Bufinefsj but this
we find made Heart-burnings, and raifed Envy
and Jealoufy in the Mind of Cain 5 and at that
Door the Devil immediately entred&amp;gt; for he, who
from the Beginning, was very diligent in his way,
never flip
d any Opportunity, or mifs d any Ad
vantages that the Circum fiances of Mankind of
fered him to do Mifchief.
What Shape or Appearance the Devil took up
to enter into a Converfation with Cam upon the
Subject, that Authors do not take upon them to
determine &amp;gt;
but tis
generally fuppofed he perfo-
nated fome of Cain s Sons or Grandfons to begin
the Difcourfe, who attack d their Father, or per
haps Grandfather, upon this Occaflon, in the fol
lowing manner, or to that Purpofe.
D. Sir, I perceive your Majefty (for the firft
Race were certainly all Monarchs as great as
Kings, to their immediate Poflerity) to be greatly
difturb d of late, your Countenance is chang d,
I your
114 The HISTORY
yournoble Chearfulnefs (the Glories of your Face)
are ftrangely funk and gone, and you are not the
Man you ufed to be&amp;gt;
pleafe yourMajefty to com
municate your Griefs to us your Children, you
may be fufe, that if it be poflible, we would pro
cure you Relief, and reftore your Delights, the
Lofs ofwhich, ifthus you go on tofubjecl: yourfelf
to too much Mejancholy, will be very hurtful to
you, and in the End deftroy you.
Cain. It is
very kind, my dear Children, to
{hew your Refpect thus to your true Progenitor,
and to offer your Afliftance : I confefs, as you fay,
my Mind is
opprefs d and difpleafed , but tho tis
very heayy, yet I know not which way to look
for Relief, for the Diftemper is above our Reach,
no Cure can be found for it on Earth.
D. Do not fay fo. Sir j there can be no Difeale
fure on Earth but may be cur d on Earth &amp;gt;
if it
be a mental Evil, we have heard that your great
Anceflor, the firft Father of us all, who lives ftill
on the great weftern Plains towards the Sea, is the
Oracle to which all his Children fly
for Direction
in fuch Cafes as are out of the Reach of the or
dinary understanding of Mankind j pleafe you to
give leave, we will take a Journey to him, and re-
prefenting your Cafe to him, we will hear his Ad
vice, and bring it to you with all
Speed, for the
Eafe of your Mind.
Cain. I know not whether he can reach my
Cafe or no.
Z). Doubtlefs he may, and if not, the Labour of
our Journey is
nothing when plac d in Competi
tion with the Eafe of your Mind &amp;gt;
tis but a few
Days travel loft, and you will not be the worfe if
we fail of the deflred Succefs.
Cain. The offer is filial, and I
accept your af-
fedionate Concern for me, with a juft Scnfe of
an obliged Parent j go then, and my Bleffing be
upon
of the DEVIL. 115
upon you; but alas !
why do I blefs? can he blefs
whom God has not blefsM !
Z). O !
Sir, -do not fay fo, has not God blefs d
you? are you not the fccond Sovereign of the
Earth ? and does he not converfe with you Face
to Face ? are not you the Oracle to all
your,
growing Pofterity, and next after his Sovereign
Imperial Majetty Lord Adam^ Patriarch of the
World ?
Cain. But has not God rejected me, and.refu-
fed to converfe any more with me, while he dai
ly Favours and Countenances my younger Bro
ther Abel) as if he refolv d to fet him up to rule
over me?
D. No, Sir, that cannot be, you cannot be
difturb d at fuch a thing $ is not the Right of So
vereignty yours by Primogeniture? can Godhim-
felf take that away, when tis once given? are
not you Lord Adam s eldeft Son ? are you not the
firftborn Glory of the Creation ? and does not
the Government defcend to you by the divine
Right of Birth and Blood ?
Cain. But what does all that fignify to me,
while God appears to favour and carets my youn
ger Brother, and to ihine upon him, while a
black Dejection and token of Difpleafure fur-
rounds me every Day, and he does not appear to
me as he ufed to do ?
D. And what need your Majefty be concern d
at that, if it be fo? if he does not appear pleafed,
you have the whole World to enjoy your felf in,
and all your numerous and rifing Pofterity Adore
and Honour you &amp;gt;
what need thofe remote Things
be any difturbance to you ?
Cain. How !
my Children, not the Favour of
God be valued !
yes, yes, in his favour is Life 5
what can all the World avail without the Smiles
and Countenance of him that made it?
I z D. Doubt-
ti6 The HISTORY
D. Doubtlefs, Sir, he that made the World
and plac d you at the Head of it all, to govern
and direct it, has made it
agreeable, and it is able
to give you a full Satisfaction and Enjoyment, if
you pleafe to confider it well,tho you were never
to converfe with him all the while you live in t.
Cain. You are quite wrong there, my Children,
quite wrong.
*
D. But do you not, great Sir, fee all your
Children as well as us rejoicing in the Plenty of
all Things, and are they not compleatly happy,
and yet they know little of this great GOD ? He
feldom converfes among us, we hear of him in
deed by your (age Advices, and we bring our Of
ferings to you for him, as you direct, and when
that s done, we enjoy whatever our Hearts de
fine; and fo -doubtlefs may you in an abundant
manner, if you pleafe.
Cain. But your Felicity is
wrong plic d then,
or you fuppofe that God is
pleafed and fatisfied
in that your Offerings are brought to me; but
what would you fay,
if you knew that God is
difpleafed ? that he docs not accept your Offerings ?
that when J iacrific d to him in behalf of you all,
he reje&ed my Offerings, tho I
brought a prince
ly Gift, being of the fined: of the Wheat, the
choked and earlieft Fruits, and the fweeted of the
Oil, an Offering fuited to the Giver of them all ?
D. But if
you offered them, Sir, how are you
fore they were not accepted ?
Cain. Yes, yes, I am fure; did not my Brother
Abel offer at the fame Time a Lamb of his Flock,
for he, you know, delights in Cattle, and covers
the Mountains with his Herds ? over him, all the
while he wasfacrificing, a bright Emanation (hone
cheating and enlivening ; a Pledge of Favour, and
light ambient Flames play d hovering in the low
er Air, as if
attending his Sacrifice $ and when rea
dy
of the DEVIL. 117
dy prepared, immediately defcended and burnt up
the Flefh, a fweet odoriferous Savour afcending to
him, who thus teftified his Acceptance &amp;gt;
whereas,
over my Head a black Cloud, mifly, and difbilling
Vapour, hung dripping upon the humble Altar
I had raifed, and wetting the fineft and choicefl
Things I had prepar d, fpoil
d and defac d them ;
the Wood unapt to burn by the Moiiture which
fell, fcarce receiv d the Fire I
brought to kindle
it, and even then, rather fmother d and choaked,
than kindled into a Flames in a Word, it went
quite out, without confuming what was brought
to be offer d up.
D. Let not our truly reverenced Lord and Father
be difquieted at all this j if he accepts not what you
bring, you are difcharg d of the Debt, and need
bring no more ; nor have the Trouble of fuch la-
bourd Collections of Rarities any more &amp;gt;
when
he thinks fit to require it
again, pou will have
Notice, no Queftion, and then it
being call d
for, will be accepted 9
or elfe why fhould it be
requir d ?
Cain. That may indeed be the Cafe, nor do
I think of attempting any more to bring an Offer
ing, for I rather take it, that I am forbidden for
the prefentj but then, what is it that my younger
Brother Triumphs in ? and how am I infulted,
in that he and his Houfe are all
Joy and Triumph,
as if
they had fome great Advantage over me, in
that their Offering was accepted when mine was
not ?
D. Does he Triumph over your Majefty, our
Lord and Sovereign ?
give us but your Order, and
we will go and pull him and all his Generation in
pieces i for to triumph over you who are his
elder Brother, is a horrid Rebellion and Treafon,
and he ought to be expell d the Society of Man
kind.
I } Cain. I
118 The HISTORY
Cain. I think fo too, indeed &amp;gt;
however, iny dear
Children and faithful
Subjects, tho I
accept your
Offer of Duty and Service, yet I will confider
very well, before I take up Arms againftmy Bro
ther 5 befides, our Sovereign Father and patri
archal Lord, Adam, being yet alive, it is not in my
t- Right to aft
offenfively without his Command.
. D. We are ready therefore to carry your Pe
tition to him, and doubt not to obtain his Licence
and Commiflion too, to empower you to do
your felf Juftice upon your younger Brother j
who being your Vaflal, or at lead inferior, as he
is
junior in Birth, infults you upon the fancied
Opinion of having a larger Share in the Divine
Favour, and receiving a Bleffing on his Sacri^
frees, on Pretence of the fame Favour being de
nied you.
Cain. I am content, go then, and give a juft
Account of the State of our Affairs.
D. We {hall foon return with the agreeable
anfwcrj let not our Lord and Father continue
fad and deje&ed, but depend upon a fpeedy Re
lief, by the Affiftance of thy numerous IlTue, all
devoted to thy Intercft and Felicity.
Cain. My Bleffing be with you in your Way,
and give you a favourable Reception at the vcne-
Tent of our univerfal Lord and Father.
Note, Here thecurfed Race being fully given
up to the Direction of the Evil-Spirit, which
fo early poflcfs d them, and fwelling with Rage
at the innocent Mel and his whole Family, they
refolved upon forming a moil wicked and detef^
table lie, to
bring about the Advice which they
had already given their Father Cain a touch of3,
and to pretend that Adam being juftly provok d
at the undutiful Behaviour of Abelj had gr*i
Cain a CommiiHon to chaftife him3 and by
Force
ofthe DEVIL; 119
Force to cut him off and all his Family, as guilty
of Rebellion and Pride.
Fill d with this mifchievous and bloody Re-
folution, they came back to their Father Caln^
after flaying a few Days, fuch as were fufficient
to make Cain believe they had been at the fpaci-
ous Plains, where Adam dwelt &amp;gt;
the fame which
are now calPd the blefled Valleys, or the Plains
of Mecca in Arabia Foslix, near the Banks of the
Red-Sea.
Note here alfo, that Cain having received a
wicked Hint from thefe Men, his Children and
Subjects, as before, intimating that Abel had bro
ken the Laws of Primogeniture in his Behavi
our towards him, (Cain) and that he might be
juftly puninYd for it; Satan, that cunning Ma
nager of all our wayward PalTions, fan d the Fire
of Envy and Jealoufy with his utmoft Skill all
the while his other Agents were abfent ; and by
the Time they came back had blown it
up in
to fuch a Heat of Fury and Rage, that it wanted
nothing but Air to make it burn out, as it foon
afterwards did in a furious Flame of Wrath and
Revenge, even to Blood and Deftruftion.
Juft in the very critical Moment, while Things
flood thus with Cain^ Satan brings in his wicked
Inftruments, as if juft arriv d with the Return of
his Meflage from Adam, at whofe Court they had
been for Orders 5 and thus they, that is the De+
vil afluming to fpeak by them, approach their
Father with an Air of folemn but chearful Satif-
fa&ion at the Succefs of their EmbafTy.
D. Hail Sovereign, Reverend, Patriarchal Lord !
we come with Joy to render thee an Account of
the Succefs of our MefTage.
Cain. Have you then feen the venerable Tents
where dwell the Heaven-born, the Angelic Pair,

ought always to be humbly paid ?
D. We have.
Cain. Did you, together with my grand Requeft,
a juft,
a humble Homage for me pay, to the great
Sir- and Mother of Mankind ?
D We did.
Cain. Did you in humble Language reprefent
the Griefs and Anguifh which opprets my Soul ?
D. We did, and back their Bleffrng to thee

D. Forbid it Heaven ! as jtfdam too forbids,
who with a jutlice God-like and peculiar to in-

Cain. To punifh? fay you, did he ufe the Word,

Cain. The Race indeed have fliar d the Merit

Shout of Triumph mock my Sorrow, when they
faw me from my Sacrifice deje&ed come, as if
my Difappointment was their Joy ?
D. This too the venerable Prince refents, and
to preferve the Race in Bounds of Laws fubordi-
nate and limited to Duty, Commands that this
firft Breach be not pafs d by, leil the Precedent
upon Record ftand to future Times to encourage
like Rebellion.
Cain. And is it then my Sovereign Parent s
Will? V
D. It is his Will, that thou his elded Son, his
Image, his belov d, fhould be maintained in all the
Rights of Sovereignty deriv d to thee from him j
and not be left expos d to injury and Power ufurp-
ed, but fhould do thy felf Juilice on the rebel
Race.
Cain. And fo I will &amp;gt;
Abel {hall quickly know
what tis to trample on his elder Brother j lhall
know that he s thus fentenc d by his Father, and
I m commiflion d but to execute his high Com
mand, his Sentence, which is God s, and that he
falls
by the Hand of Heavenly Juftice.
So now Satan had done his Work, he had de
luded the Mother to a Breach againft the firft
and only Command, he had drawn Adam to the
fame Snare, and now he brings in Cam prompted
by his own Rage, and deluded by his, (Satan s,)
Craft, to commit Murder, nay a Fratricide, an ag
gravated Murther.
Upon this he fends out Cainj while the bloody
Rage was in its Ferment, and wickedly at the fame
Time bringing Abel^ innocent and fearing no ill,
juft in his Way, he fuggefts to his Thoughts fuch
Words as thefe.
Look
122 The HIS TORY
Look you Cain^ fee how Divine Juftice con
curs with your Father s
righteous Sentence, fee
there s
thy Brother Abel directed by Heaven to fall
into thy Hands unarm d, unguarded, that thou
may ft do thy felf Juftice upon him without Fear&amp;gt;
fee thou may ft kill him, and if thou haft a Mind
to conceal it, no Eyes can fee, or will the World
ever know it, fo that no Refentment or Revenge
upon thee, or thy Pofterity, can be apprehended,
but it
may be faid fome wild Bead had rent him;
nor will any one fuggeft that thou, his Brother,
and Superior, could poffibly be the Perfon.
Cain prepared for the Fact, by his former a-
vow d Rage and Refolution of Revenge, was
fb much the lefs prepar d to avoid the Snare
thus artfully contriv d by the Mafter of all Sub-
tilty, the Devil &amp;gt;
fo he immediately runs upon his
Brother ^^/,and after a little unarm d Refiftance,
the innocent poor Man expecting no fuch Mif-
chief, was conquer d and murther d 5 after which,
as is to be fuppofed, the exafperated Crew of
Cairis outrageous Race, overrun all his
Family and
Houfhold, killing Man, Woman and Child.
It is
obje&ed here that we have no Authority
in Scripture to prove this Part of the Story; but
I anfwer, tis not likely but that Abel^ as well as
Cain* being at Man s
Eftatelong before this, had
feveral Children by their own Sifters, for they
were the only Men in the World who were al-
low d the Marrying their own Sifters, there be
ing no other Women then in the World ; and as
we never read of any of Abel s
Pofterity, tis
likewife as probable they were all murther d, as
that they fhould kill Abel only, whofe Sons might
immediately fall upon Cain for the Blood of their
Father, and fo the World have been involv d in
a Civil War as foon as there were two Families
in it,
But
of the DEVIL. 123
But be it fo or not, tis not doubted the Devil
wrought with Cain in the horrid Murther, or
he had never done it 5 whether it was directly or
by Agents is not material, nor is the Latter unlike
ly &amp;gt;
and if the Latter, then there is no Improba
bility in the Story, for why might not he that made
Ufe of the Serpent to tempt Eve^ be as well fuppo-
fed to make a Tool of fome of Cain s Sons or
Grandfons to prompt him in the wicked Attempt
of murthering his Brother ? and why muft we
be oblig d to bring in a Miracle or an Apparition
into the Story, to make it
probable that the Devil
had any Hand in it, when twas fo natural to a de
generate Race to act in fuch a Manner?
However it was, and by whatever Tool the
Devil wrought, tis certain that this was the Confe-
quence, poor Abel was butcher d, and thus the Devil
made a fecond Conqueft in God s Creation j for
Adam was now., as may be faid, really Childlefs,
for his two Sons were thus far loft, Abel was kill
ed, and Cain was curft and driven out from the
Prefence of the Lord, and his Race blafted with
him.
It would be a ufeful enquiry here, and worthy
our giving an Account of, could we come to a
Certainty in it, namely, what was the Mark that
God fet
upon Cain^ by which he was kept from
being fallen upon by Abel s Friends or Relations?
but as this does not belong to the Devil s
Hiftory,
and it was God s Mark, not the Dm/ s, I have
nothing to do with it here.
The Devil had now gain d his Point, the King
dom of Grace, fo newly erected, had been as it
were extinct without a new Creation, had not
Adam and Eve been alive, and had not Eve^ tho now
1
30 Years of Age, been a breeding young Lady,
for we muft fuppofe the Woman, in that State of
Longevity, bare Children till
they were feven or
eight
124 The HISTORY
eight hundred Year old : This Teeming of Eve
peopled not the World fo much as it reftored
the blefled Race&amp;gt;
for tho Abel was kill d Cain
had a numerous Offspring prefently, which had
Setb9 (Adam s third Son) never been born, would
foon have replenifh d the World with People,
fuch as they were ; the Seed of a Murtherer,
curfed of God, branded with a Mark of Infamy,
and who afterwards fell all
together in the univerfal
Ruine of the Race by the Deluge.
But after the Murther of Abel^ Adam had ano
ther Son born, namely, Seth^ the Father of Enos9
and indeed the Father of the holy Race * for du
ring his Time and his Son Enos9 the Text fays
that Men began to call on the Name ofthe Lord 5
that is to fay, they began to look back upon Cain
and his wicked Race, and being convinc d of the
Wickednefs they had committed, and led their
whole Pofterity into, they began to fue to Heaven
for Pardon of what was paft, and to lead a new
fort of Life.
But the Devil had met with too much Succefs
in his firft
Attempts, not to go on with his ge
neral Refolution of debauching the Minds of Men,
and bringing them off from God &amp;gt;
and therefore
as he kept his Hold upon Cain s curfed Race, em-
broiPd already in Blood and Murther $ fo he pro
ceeded with his
degenerate Offspring, till in a
Word he brought both the holy Seed and the
degenerate
Race to joyn in one univerfal Confent
of-
Crime, and to go on in it with fuch aggra
vating Circumflances, as that it
repented the
Lord that he had made Man, and he rcfolv d to
overwhelm them again with a general Deftruc-
tion, and clear the World of them.
The Succeffion of Blood in the royal original /
Line of Adam^ is
prefcrv d in the facred Hiflories
and brought down as low as Noah and his three
Sons,
of the DEVIL: 125
Sons, for a continu d feries of I4)*o Years, fay
fome, 1640 fay others 5 in which Time Sinfpread
it felf fo generally thro the whole Race, and the
Sons of God, fo the Scripture calls the Men of
the righteous Seed, the Progeny of Seth, came
in unto the Daughters of Men, that is, join d them-
felves to the curs d Race of Cain, and married
promifcuoufly with them, according to their Fan
cies, the Women it fecms being beautiful and
tempting j andtho the Devil could not make the
Women handfome or ugly in one or other Families,
yet he might work up the Guft of wicked Incli
nation on either Side, fo as to make both the
Men and Women tempting and agreeable to one
another, where they ought not to have been fo *
and perhaps, as it is often feen to this Day, the
more tempting for being under legal Rcftraint.
It is
objected here, that we do not find in the
Scripture that the Men and Women of either
Race were at that Time forbidden intermarrying
with one another 5 and it is true, that literally it is
not forbid 5 but if we did not fcarch rather to
make doubts than to explain them, we might fup-
pofe it was forbidden by fome particular Command
at that Time 5 feeing we may reafonably allow every
Thing to be forbidden, which they are tax d with
a Crime in committing
-
y and as the Sons of God
taking them Wives as they thought fit to choofe,
tho from among the Daughters of the curfed
Race, is there charg d upon them as a general
Depravation, and a great Crime 5 and for which,
tis faid, GOD even repented that he had made
them, we need go no farther to fatisfy our felves
that it was certainly forbidden.
Satan no doubt too had a Hand in this Wick-
ednefs 5 for as it was his Bufinefs to prompt Men
to do every Thing which God had prohibited, fo
the Reafon given why the Men of thofe Days
i did
The HISTORY
did this Thing was, they faw the Daughters of
Men, that is of the wicked Race or forbidden
Sort, were fair,
he tempted them by the Luft of
the Eye j in a word, the Ladies were beautiful
and agreeable, and the Devil knew how to make
life of the Allurement $ the Men liked and took
them by the meer Direction of their Fancy and
Appetite, without regarding the fiipreme Pro
hibition &amp;gt; They took them Wives of all which they
chofe^ or fuch as they lik d to choofe.
But the Text adds, that this promifcuous Ge
neration went farther than the meer outward
Crime of it, for it fhew d that the Wickednefs
of the Heart of Man was great before God, and
that he refented it ; In hort,God perceived a Dege
neracy orDefedk ofVirtue had feiz d upon the whole
Race, that there was a general Corruption of
Manners, a Depravity of Nature upon them,
that even the holy Seed was tainted with it, that
the Devil had broken in upon them, and prevaiFd
to a great Degree , that not only the Pra&ice of
the Age was corrupt, for that God could eafily
have reitrain d, but that the very Heart of Man
was debauch d, his Defires wholly vitiated, and
his Senfes engag d in it &amp;gt;
fo that in a Word, it
became neceflary to fhew the divine Difpleafure,
not in the ordinary Manner, by Judgment and Re
proofs of fuch kind as
ufually reclaim Men, but
by a general Deftru&ion to Yweep them away,
clear the Earth of them, and put an End to the
Wickednefs at once, removing the Offence and
the Offenders all
together ^ this is
fignify d at large,
Gen. vi. f. God faw that the
Wickednefs of Man
was great in the Earth, and that every Imagination
of the
Thoughts of his Heart was only evil continu
ally. And again ^ 1
1, it. The Earth atfo was
corrupt before God ; and the Earth was fitted with
Violence. And God looked upon the Earth, and be
hold
of the DEVIL: 127
hold it was corrupt
-
3 for all Flejh bad corrupted
his Way upon the Earth.
It muft be confefs d it was a ftrange Conqueft
the Devil had made in the Antediluvian World,
that he had, as I may fay, ,
brought the whole
Race of Mankind into a general Revolt from
God -
y Noah was indeed a Preacher of Righte-
oufnefs, and he had preach d about foo Years
to as little
Purpofe as moil of the good Minifters
ever did j for we do not read there was one Man
converted by him, or at leaft not one of them left,
for that at the Deluge there was either none of
them alive, or none fpar d but Noah and his three
Sons, and their Wives -
y and even they are (
tis evi
dent) recorded, not fo much to be fav d for
their own Goodnefs, but becatife they were his
Sons j Nay, without Breach of Chanty we may
conclude, that at leaft one went to the Devil even
of thofe three, namely, Ham or Cham for triumph
ing in a brutal Manner over his Father s Drunk-
ennefs 5 for we find the fpecial Curfe reached to
him and his Pofterity for many Ages 3 and whether
it went no farther than the prefent State of Life
with them, we cannot tell.
We will fuppofe now that thro this whole i
foo
Years the Devil having fo effe&ually debauch d
Mankind, had advanc d his infernal Kingdom to
a prodigious Height &amp;gt;
for the Text fays, the whole
Earth ivasfilFd with violence; in a Word, Blood,
Murder, Rape, Robbery, Oppreffion and Injuftice
prevail d every where, and Man, like the wild
Bear in the Foreft, liv d by Prey, biting and
devouring one another.
At this Time Noah begins to preach a new
Doctrine to them, for as he had before been a
Preacher of Righteoufnefs, now he becomes a
Preacher of Vengeance $ firft he tells them they
ftiall be all oyerwhelm d with a Deluge, thac
i for
The HISTORY
that for their Sins God repented they were made,
and that he would deftroy them all, adding, that
to prevent the Ruin of himfelf and Family, he
refolv d to build him a Ship to have recourfe to
when the Water fhould come over the Reft of
the World.
What Jefting, what Scorn, what Contempt
did this Work expofe the good old Man to for
above a 100 Years? for fo long the Work was
building, as antient Authors fay &amp;gt;
let us reprefent to
our felves in the moil lively Manner how the
witty World at that Time behav d to poor old
Noah , how they took their Evening Walks to fee
what he was doing, and paiTed their Judgment
upon it, and upon the Progrefs of it 5 I fay, to
reprefent this to our felves, we need go no far
ther than to our own Witicifms upon Religion^
and upon the molt folemn Myileries of Divine
Worfhip -y
how we damn the Serious for Enthu-
fiafts, think the Grave mad, and the Sober me
lancholy y call Religion it felf Flatus and Hyp-
po -y
make the Devout ignorant, the Divine mer
cenary, and the whole Scheme of Divinity a
Frame of Prieflcraft j and thus no doubt the
building an Ark or Boat, or whatever they call d
it, to float over the Mountains, and dance over the
Plains,, what could it be but a religious Frenzy,
and the Man that fo buried himfelf, a Lunatick ?
and all this in an Age when divine Things came
by immediate Revelation into the Minds of
Men ! the Devil muft therefore have made a
ftrange Conquer! upon Mankind to obliterate all
the Reverence, which but a little before was fo
ftrangcly imprefs d upon them concerning their
Maker.
This was certainly the Height of the Devtrs
Kingdom, and we fhall never find him arrive to
fuch a Pitch again-, he was then truly and lite
rally
of the DEVIL. I2 p
rally
the univerfal Monarch, nay the God of
this World 5 and as all Tyrants do, he governs
them with an arbitrary abfolute
f
Sway &amp;gt;
and had
not God thought fit to give him a Writ of
Ejectment, and afterwards drown him out of Pof-
feiHon, I know not what would have been the
Cafe, he might have kept his Hold for ought I
know till the Seed of the Woman came to bruife
his Head, that is to fay, cripple his Government,
Dethrone him and Depofe his Power, as has been
fulfill d in the Meffiah.
But as he was, I fay, drown d out of the World,
his
Kingdom for the prefent was at an End j at
leaft., if he had a Dominion he had no Subjects,
and as the Creation was in a Manner renewed, fo
the Devil- had all his Work to do over again :
Unhappy Man ! how has he, by his weak Reiif-
tance, made the Devil^ recovering his Hold too
eafy to him, and given him all the Advantages,
except as before excepted, which he had before?
Now whether he retired in the mean Time, and
how he got footing again after Noah and his Fa
mily were landed upon the New Surface, that we
come next to enquire.

THE Story of Noah, his

they took, and the bad Weather they met with,
tho it would embellifh this Work very well, and

come
i$o The HISTORY
come in very much to the Purpofe in this Place,
yet as it does not belong to the Devtfs Story, for
I cannot prove what fome fnggeft (viz.) that he
was in the Ark among the Reft, I fay, for that
Reafon I muft omit it.
And now having mentioned Satan s being in
the Ark j as I fay, I cannot prove it, fo there are,
I think, fome good Reafons to believe he was
not there : Firft^ I know no Bufinefs he had there $
fecondly^
we read ofno Mifchiefdone there, and thefe
joyn d together make me conclude he was ab-
(ent } the la ft I
chiefly infift upon, that we read ofno
Mifchief done there, which if he had been in
the Ark, would certainly have happened &amp;gt;
and there
fore I fuppofe rather, that when he faw his
Kingdom diflblv d, his Subjects all
ingulph d in
an inevitable Ruin and Defolation, a Sight fuitable
enough to him, except as it
might unking him for
a Time} I fay, when he faw this, he took care to
fpeed himfcif away as well as he could, and make
his Retreat to a Place of Safety, where that was, is
no more difficult to us, than it was to him.
It is
fuggefled that as he is Prince of the Power
of the Air, he retired only into that Region. It is
molt rational to fuppofe he went no further on
many Accounts, of which I fliall
fpeak by and by :
Here he ftay d hovering in the Earth s Atmof-
pherc, as he has often done fince, and perhaps
now does &amp;gt;
or if the Atmofphere of this Globe
wasafFcted by the Indraft oftheAbforption,asfomc
think, then he kept himfelf upon the Watch, to
lee what the Event of the new Phenomenon would
be, and this Watch, wherever it was, I doubt not,
was as near the Earth as he could place himfelf
perhaps in the Atmofphere of the Moon, or in
a Word, the next Place of Retreat he could
find.
i
From
of the DEVIL; 131
Froni hence I took upon me to irififtj that Sa
tan has not a more certain Knowledge of Events
than we &amp;gt;
I lay, he has not a more certain Know
ledge
-
9 that he may be able to make ftronger Con
jectures and tnore rational Conclufions from that
he fees, I will not deny
-
y and that which he moil
outdoes us in is, that he fees more to conclude
from than we can, but I am fatisfied he knows
nothing of Futurity more than we can fee by Obfer-
vation and Inference $ nor, for Example) did he
know whether God would repeople the World
any more or no.
I muft therefore allow that he only waited to
fee what would be the Event of this flrange E-
ruption of Water, and what God proposed to do
with the Ark, and all that was in it.
Some Philofophers tell us, befides what I hinted
above, that the Devil could have no Retreat in
the Earth s Atmofphere, for that the Air being
wholly condens d intoWater, and having continual
ly pour d down its Streams to deluge the Earth, that
Body was become fo fmall, and had fufFer d fuch
Convullions, that there was but juft enough Air
left to furround the Water, or as might ffcrve
by
its PrefTure to preferve the natural Pofition of
Things, and fupply the Creatures in the Ark with
a Part to breath in.
The Atmofphere indeed might fuffer feme ftrange
and unnatural Motions at that Time, but not (I be
lieve) to that Degree, however, I will not affirm that
there could be room in it, or is now for the Devil,
much lefs for all the numberlefs Legions of Sa
tan s Hoft j but there was, and now certainly is, fuf-
ficient Space to receive him, and a fufficient Body
of his Troops for the Bufinefs he had for them -a c
that time, and that s
enough to the Purpofe j cr
if the Earth s
Atmofphere did fuffer any particular
Convulflon, on that Occafion, he might make his
K i Retreat
1 33 The HISTORY
Retreat to the Atmofphere of the Moon, or of
Mars^ or of Venus^ or of any of the other Pla
nets y or to any other Place, for he that is Prince
of the Air could not want Retreats in fuch a
Cafe, from whence he might watch for the I flue
of Things &amp;gt;
certainly he did not go far, becaufe
his Buiinefs lay here, and he never goes out of his
Way of doing Mifchief.
In particular, his more than ordinary Concern
was, to fee whnt would become of the Ark &amp;gt;
he
was wife enough doubtlefs to fee, that GOD, who
had directed its
making, nay even the very Struc
ture of it, would certainly take Care of it, preferve
it
upon the Water, and bring it to fome Place
of Safety or other &amp;gt;
tho where it fhould be, the
Devil with all his
Cunning could not refolve,
whether on the fame Surface the Waters draw
ing off, or in any other created or to be created
Place 5 and this State of Uncertainty being evi
dently his Cafe, and which proves his Ignorance
of Futurity, it was his Bufinefs, If*)-*
to watch
with the utmoil vigilance for the Event.
If the Ark was (as Mr. Burnet thinks) guided
by two Angels, they not only held it from foun
dering or being fwallow d up in the Water, but
certainly kept the Waters calm about it, efpecially
when the Lord brought a flrong Wind to blow
over the whole Globe, which by the Way was the
firft, and, I
fuppofe, the only univerfal Storm that
ever blew, for to be fure it blew over the whole
Surface at once 5 I fay, if it was thus guided, to be
furc the Devil faw it, and that with Envy and
Regret that he could do it no Injury, for doubt
lefs had it been in the Devil s Power, as God had
drown d the whole Race of Man, except what
was in the Ark, he would have taken care to have
difpatch d them too, and fo made an End of the
Creation at once 5 but either he was not empowered
4 to
of the DEVIL. 135
to go to the Ark, or it was fo well guarded by
Angels, that when he came near it he could do
it no harm : So it relied at
length, the Waters
abating on the Mountains of Arrarat in Armenia^
or fome where elfe that Way, and where they
fay a Piece of the Keel is
remaining to this Day ,
of which, however with Dr. I fay, I be
lieve not one Word.
The Ark being fafe landed, tis reafonable to
believe Noah prepared to go on Shore, as the Sea
men call it, as foon as the dry Land began to ap
pear &amp;gt;
and here you mufl allow me to fuppofe
Satan, tho himielf cloth d with a Cloud, fo as
not to be feen, came immediately, and pearching
on the Roof, faw all the Heaven-kept Houmold
fafely landed, and all the Hoft of living Creatures
difperfing themfelves down the Sides of the Moun
tain, as the Search of their Food or other proper
Occafions directed them.
This Sight was enough -,
Satan was at no Lofs
to conclude from hence that the Defign of God
was to repeople the World by the Way of ordi
nary Generation, from thePofterity of thefe eight
Perfons, without creating any new Species.
Very well, fays the Devil

and I am now juft where I was

is
my Man now, and if I do not matter him
one way or another, I am miftakenjn my Mark.
Pardon me for making a Speech for the Devil.
Noah big with a Senfe of his late Condition,
and while the Wonders of the Deluge were frefh
in his Mind, fpent his firft
Days in the Extaiies
of his Soul, giving Thanks, and praifing the Power
K 3 that
134 The HISTORY
that had been his Prote&ion, in and thro the
Flood of Waters, and which had in fo miraculous
a Manner, lately landed him on the Surface of the
newly difcover d Land 3 and the Text tells us, as
pnc of the firft
Things he was employ d in, H&
built an Altar unto the Lord^ and offered Burnt-Of
ferings upon the Altar. Gen. viii. 20.
While Noah was thus employ d he was fafe?
the Devil himfelf could no where break in uponf
him , and we may fuppofe very reafonably, as he
found the old Father invulnerable, he left him
for foine Years, watching notwithstanding all
poflible Advantages againil his Sons and their
Children j for now the Family began to encreafe,
and Noah s Sons had feveral Children j whether
himfelf had any more Children after the Flood or
not, that we are not arrived to any Certainty about.
Among his Sons the Devil found Japhet and
Sbem^ good, pious, religious, and very devout Per-
fons -,
jerving God daily, after the Example of their
good old Father Noah^ and he could make no
thing of them, or of any of their Pofterity -, but
Ham the fecond, or according to fome, the young
er Son of Ncah^ had a Son who was nam d Ca-.
naan^ a loofe young profligate Fellow, his Edu
cation was probably but curfory and fuperficial?
his Father Ham not being near fo religious and
ferious a Man as his Brothers Shew and Japhet
were 3 and as Canaan s Education was defe&ive,
fo he prov d, as untaught Youth generally do, a
wild, and in fhort a very wicked Fellow, and con-
fequcntly a fit Tool for the Devil to go to work
with.
Noah) a diligent induftrious Man, being with
all his Family thus planted in the rich fruitful
Plains of Armenia^ or wherever you pleafe,let it be
near the Mountains of Caucafas or Arrarat &amp;gt;
went
immediately to work? cultivating and improv
ing
of fife DEVIL: 135
Ing the Soil, encreafing his Cattle and Paftures,Tow
ing Corn, and among other Things planting Trees
for Food, and among the Fruit Trees he planted
Vines, of the Grapes thereof he made no doubt, as
they ftill in the {ame Country do make, moil excel
lent Wine, rich, lufcious, thong, and pleafant.
I cannot come into the Notion of our Criticks,
who to excufe Noah from the guilt of what follow
ed, or at leaft from the Cenfure, tell us, he knew
not the Strength or the Nature of Wine, but
chat gathering the heavy Clutters of the Grapes,
and their own weight cruthing out their balmy
Juices into his Hand, he tafled the tempting Li
quor, and that the Devil afliiling he was charm d
with the delicious Fragrance, and tafted again and
again, preffing it out into a Bowl or Difh, that
he might take a larger Quantity 3 till at
length the
heady Froth afcended and feizing his Brain, he
became intoxicate and drunk, not in the leaft ima
gining there was any fuch Strength in the Juice
of that excellent Fruit.
But to make out this Story, which is indeed
very favourable for Noah^ but in it felf extremely

wilt by no means fuppoie what is

as Wine made before the Deluge, and that no
Body had been ever made drunk with the Juice
of the Grape before N&ab, which, I
fay, is
beg
ging the Qucftion in the grofTeil Manner.
If the Contrary is
true, as I fee no Reafon to
queflion, if, I fay, it was true that there was
Wine drank, and that Men were or had been
drunk with it before, they cannot then but fup-
pofe that Noah) who was a wife, a great and a
good Man, and a Preacher of Righteoufmfs, both
K 4 knew
ij6 The HISTORY
knew of it, and without doubt had in his preach
ing againft their- Crimes, preach d againfl this
among the reft, upbraided them with it, reprov d
them for it, and exhorted them againft it.
jigain^ tis
highly probable they had Grapes
growing, and confequcntly Wines made from
them, in the Antediluvian World, how elfe did
Noah come by the Vines which he planted ? For
we are to fuppofe, he could plant no Trees or
Shrubs, but fuch as he found the Roots of in the
Earth, and which no doubt had been there before
in their higheft Perfection, and had confequent-
ly grown up and brought forth the fame lufci-
ous Fruit before.
Befides, as he found the Roots of the Vines,
fo he underftood what they were, and what Fruit
they bore, or elfe it
may be fuppofed alfo he
would not have planted them 5 for he planted
them for their Fruit, as he did it in the Provilion
he was making for his Subfiflence, and the Sub-
iiftence of his Family : and if he did not know
what they were, he would not have fet them, for
he was not planting for Diverfion but for Profit.
Upon the whole it feems plain to me he knew
what he did, as well when he planted the Vines as
when he prefled out the Grapes &amp;gt;
and alfo when he
drank the Juice that he knew it was Wine, was
llrong and would make him drunk if he took
enough of it : He knew that other Men had been
drunk with fuch Liquor before the Flood, and
that he had reprehended them for it $ and there
fore it was not his Ignorance, but the Devil took
him at forne Advantage, when his Appetite was
eager, or he thirfty, and the Liquor cooling and
pleafant ; and in fhort, as Eve faid, the Serpent be-
gmldedher^ and ihe DID EAT, fo the Devil beguiled
Noah, and be DID DRINK -
y the Temptation was
too llrong for Noab^ not the Wine$ he knew
well
of the DEVIL. 137
well enough what he did, but as the Drunkards
fay to this Day, it was fo good he could not for
bear it, and fo he got drunk before he was aware j
or as our ordinary Speech exprefTes it, he was over
taken with drink) and Mr. Pool and other Expo-
fitors are partly of the fame Mind.
No fooner was the poor old Man conquer d, and
the Wine had lighten d his Head, but it
may be
fuppofed he falls off from the Chair or Bench
where he fate, and tumbling backward his Clothes,
which in thofe hot Countries were only loofe
open Robes, like the Vefts which the Armenians
wear to this Day, flying abroad, or the Devil fo
affifting
on purpofe to expofe him, he lay there
in a naked indecent Poiture not fit to be feen.
In this juncture who fhould come by but young
Canaan^ fay fome $ or as others think,&quot;
this
young
Fellow firIt attack d him byway of Kindncfs and
pretended Affection ; prompted his Grandfather
to drink, on Pretence of the Wine being good
for him, and, proper for the Support of his old
Age, and fubtilly let
upon him, drinking dfo with
him, and fo (his Head being too ftrong for the old
Man s) drank him down, and then, Devil like, tri-
umph d over him 5 boafled of his
Conqueir,, in-
fulted the Body as it were dead, uncovered hi in
on purpofe to expofe him, and leaving him in
that indecent Poihire, went and made Sport with
it to his Father Ham^ who in that Part, wicked
like himfelf, did the fame to his Brethren Japhet
and Shew &amp;gt;
but they like modeil and good Men,
far from carrying on the wicked Infult on their
Parent, went and cover d him, as the Scripture
exprelles it, and as may be fuppofed inform d him
how he had been abus d, and by whom.
Why elfe fhould Noah^ when he came to him
felf, {hew his Refentment fo much again ft Canaan

ag^inft
Ham his Father,
and
i 3 8 The HISTORY
and who tis fuppofed in the Story the guilt chief*
ly lay upon? we fee the Curfe is
(as it were) laid
wholly upon Canaan the Grandfon, and not 3
Word of the Father is
mentioned, Gen. ix.
if, 16,
2.j, Curfed be Canaan, a Servant of Servants Jball
he be, 8cc.
That Ham was Guilty, that s certain from the
Hiilory of Fact, but I cannot but fuppofe his
Grandlon was the Occafion of it ; and in this
Cafe the Devil fcems to have made Canaan the
Tnftrument or Tool to delude Noah^ and draw
liim in to Drunkennefs, as he made the Serpent the
Tool to beguile Eve^ and draw her into Difobe-
dience.
Poffibly Canaan might do it without Defign
at fir ft, but might be brought in to ridicule
and make a Jeft of the old Patriarch afterward,
as is too frequent lince in the Practice of our
Days 5
but I rather believe he did it
really with a
wicked Defign, and on Purpofe to expofe and in*-
fult his Reverend old Parent 5 and this feems more
likely too, bccaufe of the great Bitternefs with
which Noah relented it, after he came to be in-
form d of it.
But be that as it will, the Devil certainly made
a great Conquer! here, and as to outward Ap^
pcarance no Ids than that which he gain d be
fore over Adam-y nor did the Devil s
Victory con-
fid barely in his having drawn in the only righte
ous Man of the whole Antediluvian World, and fo
beginning or initiating the new young Progeny
with a Crime} but here was the great Oracle filenc d
at once; the Preacher of Righteoufnefs, for fuch
no doubt he would have been to the new World,
ns he was to the old, I lay, the Preacher was
turn d out of Office, or his Mouth itopt, which
was worfe , nay, it was a flopping of his Mouth in
cheworft kind5
far wprfc than Hopping his Breath,
for
DEVIL; i^
for had he died, the Office had defcended to his
Sons Shem and Jafhet, but he was dead to the
Office of an Inftru6bor, tho alive as to his Being
-
9
For of what Force could his Preachings be, who
had thus fallen himfelf into the moil fharneful
and bealHy Excefs?
Befides fome are of the Opinion, tho I
hope
without Ground, that Noah was not only over
taken once in his Drink, but that being fallen
into that Sin it became habitual, and he continued
in it a great while, and that it was this which is the
meaning of his being uncovered in his Tent, and
that his Son faw his Nakednefs , that is, he conti?
nually expofed himfelf for a long Time, a hun^
dred Years, fay they, and that his Son Ham^ and
his Grandfon Canaan having drawn him into it,
Jccpt him in it, encourag d and prompted it, and all
the while Satan ftill
prompting them, joined their
Scoffs and contempt of him, with their wicked En-*
deavours to promote theWickednefsj and both with
as much Succefs as the Devil himfelf could wifli for.
Then as for his two Sons modeftly and decent
ly covering their Father, they tell us, that Repre-
fents Shem and Japhet applying themfelves in an
humble and dutiful Manner to their Father, to.
entreat and befeech him to confider his antient
Glory, his own pious Exhortations to the late
drowned World, and to confider the Offence
which he gave by his evilCourfes to God, and the
Scandal to his whole Family, and alfothat they arc
brought in effectually prevailing upon him 5 and
that then Noah curfed the Wickednefs of Ham s
degenerate Race, in
Teftimony of his fincere Re
pentance after the Fact.
The Story is not fo very unlikely as it is cer
tain that it is not to be proved, and therefore we
had better take it as we find it (viz.) for one fin-
gle
At j but fuppqfe it was fo, tis ftill certain
that
I 4o The HISTORY
that Noab s
Preaching was fadly interrupted, the
Energy of his Words flatter d, and the Force of
his Pcrfuafions enervated and abated, by thisfhamc-
ful Fall 5 that he was effectually filenc d for an
Inftruc~bor ever after, and this was as much as the
Devil had Occafion for 3 and therefore indeed we
read little more of him, except that he lived three
hundred and fifty Years after the Flood j nay, we
do not fo much as read that he had any more
Children, but the contrary, nor indeed could
Noah have any more Children, except by his old
and perhaps fuper-annuated Wife , who it was
very likely he had had four or five hundred Year,
unlefs you will fuppofe he was allow d to marry
fome of his own Progeny, Daughters or Gran*
daughters, which we do not fuppofe was allow d,
no not to Adam himfelf.
This was certainly a Matter-piece of the Devil s
Policy, and a fatal Inftance of his
unhappy Di
ligence, (viz.) that the Door of the Ark was no
fooner open, and the Face of the World hardly
dry from theuniverfal Deftruftion ofMankind, but
he was at work among them j and that not only
to form a general Defection among the Race,
upon the Foot of the original Taint of Nature,
but like a bold Devil he ftrikes at the very Root,
and flies at the next general Reprefentative of
Mankind, attacks the Head of the Family, that
in his Mifcarriage the Rife and Progrefs of a Re
formation of the new World fhould receive an
early Check, and {hould be at once prevented;
I fay, like a bold Devil, he ftrikes at the Root,
and alas ! poor unhappy Noah^ he proved too
weak for him, Satan prevaiPd in his
very fir/ft At
tempt, and got the Victory over him at once.
Noah thus overcome, and Satan s Conqueft
carried on to the utmoft of his own Wiihes,
the Devil had little more to do in the World
for
of the DEVIL. 141
for fome Ages, than to carry on an univerfal De
generacy among Mankind, and to finilh it
by a like diligent Application, in deluding the
Generality of the Race, and them as they came
on gradually into Life j this he found the lefs dif
ficult, becaufe of the firft Defection which fpread
like a Contagion upon the Earth immediately
after.
The firft Evidence we have of his Succefs in
this mifchievous Defign was in the Building that
great ftupendious Stair-cafe, for fuch it feems it
was intended, calPd Babel^ which if the whole
World had not been drunk, or otherwife infatua
ted, they would never have undertaken &amp;gt;
even Sa
tan himfelf could never have prevaiPd with them
to undertake fuch a prepofterous Piece of Work,
for it had neither End or Means, Poffibility or
Probability in it.
I muft confefs I am fometimes apt to vindicate
our old Ancestors, in my Thoughts, from the
Charge it felf, as we generally underftand it, name
ly, that they really defign d to build a Tower
which fhould reach up to Heaven, or that it
fhould fccure them in cafe of another Flood ; and
Father Cafaubon is of my Opinion, whether I am.
of his or no, is a Queflion by it felf5 his opini
on is that the Confufion was nothing but a Breach
among the Undertakers and Direftors of the
Work, and that the Building was defign d chiefly
for a Store-houfe for Provinons, in Cafe of a fe-
cond Deluge $ as to their Notion of its
reaching
up to Heaven, he takes the Expreffion to be alle
gorical rather than little, and only to mean that it
fhould be exceeding high ; perhaps they might
not be Aftronomers enough to meafure the Dif-
tance of Space between the Earth and Heaven,
as we pretend to do now , but as Noah was then
alive,
I4i the HISTORY
alive, and as we believe all his three Sons were fo
too, they were able to have inform d them how
abfurd it was to fuppofe either the one or the other
.(viz.) (i.) that they could build up to Heaven, or
(2..) that they could build firm enough to refill:,
or high enough to overtop the Waters, fuppofing
fuch another Flood Should happen &amp;gt;
I would ra
ther think it was only that they intended to build
a moft glorious and magnificent City, where they
might all inhabit together j and that this Tower
was to be built for Ornament and alfo for Strength,
or as above, and for a Store- houfe to lay up vaft
Magazines of Provifions, in Cafe of extraordinary
Floods or other Events, the City being built in a
great Plain, namely, the Plains of Shimar near the
River Euphrates.
But the Story, as it is recorded, fuits better
with Satan s Mealurcs at that Time -
y and as he
was from the Beginning prompting them to every
Thing that was contrary to the Happinefs of
Man, fo the more prepofterous it was, and the more
inconfifient with common Senle, the more to his
Purpofe; and it fhew d the more what acornpleat
Conqueft he had gain d over the Reafon as well
as the Religion of Mankind at that Time.
Again, tis evident in this Cafe, they were not
only aching contrary to the Nature of Things,
but contrary to the Defign and to the Command
of Heaven j for God s Command was that they
fhould replenifh the Earth, that is, that they fhould
fpread their Habitations over it, and People the
whole Globe j whereas they were pitching in one
Place, as if they were not to multiply fufficient
to take up any more.
But what car d the Devil for that, or to put
it a little handfomer, that was what Satan aim
ed at 5 for it was enough to him, to bring Man
kind
bf the D E V I L; 143
kind to ab juft contrary to what Heaven had di-
re&ed or commanded them in any thing, and if
poffiblc in every Thing.
But God himfelf put a flop to this foolifh Piece
of Work, and it was time indeed to do fo, for
a madder thing the Devil himfelf never propofed
to them 5 I fay, God himfelf put a flop to this
new Undertaking, and difappointed the Devil j
and how was it done? not in Judgment and An
ger, as
perhaps the Devil expefted and hop d for,
but as pitying the Simplicity of that dreaming
Creature Man, he confufed their Speech, or as
fome fay, divided and confufed their Councils, fo
that they could not agree with one another, which
would be the fame Thing as not to underftand
one another &amp;gt;
or he put a new Shibboleth upon
their Tongues , thereby feparating them into
Tribes or Families, for by this every Family found
themfelves under a Neceffity of keeping together,
and this naturally encreafed that Differing jargons
of Language, for at firft it
might be no more,
What a Confufion this was to them we all
know, by their being oblig d to leave off their
building, and immediately feparating one from an
other j but what a Surprize it was to the old
Serpent, that remains to be confidered of, for in
deed it
belongs to his Hiftory.
Satan had never met with any Disappointment
in all his wicked .Attempts till now -,
for firft, he
fucceeded even to triumph upon Eve^ he did the
like upon Cam^ and in fhort upon the whole
World, one Man (Noah) excepted-, when he blend
ed the Sons of God, and the Daughters of Hell,
for fo the Word is underftood, together, in
pro-
mifcuous Voluptuous Living as well as Genera
tion.
As to the Deluge, Authors are not agreed whe
ther it was a Difeppointment to the Devil or no,
it
144 The H I STORY
it
might be indeed a Surprize to him, for tho*
Noah had preach d of it for a hundred Year toge
ther, yet as he (Satan) daily prompted the People
not to heed or believe what that old Fellow Noah
faid to them, and to ridicule his whimfical Build
ing a monftrous Tub to fwim or float in, when
the faid
Deluge fhould come; fo I am of the Opi
nion he did not believe it himfelf, and am pofitive
he could not forefee it, by any infight into Futu
rity that he was Matter of.
Tis true the Aftronomers tell us, there was a
very terrible Comet feen in the Air, that it
ap
peared for 1 80 Days before the Flood continual
ly -,
and that as it
approach d nearer and nearer
every Day all the while, fo that at laft it burft
and fell down in a continual Spout or Stream of
Water, being of a watry Subftance, and the
Quantity fo great, that it was forty Days a
falling ;
fo that this Comet not only foretold die
Deluge
or drowning of the Earth, but actually performed
it, and drown d it from it felf.
But to leave this Tale to them that told it,
let us contider the Devil, furpris d, and a little
amaz d at the Abforption or Inundation, or what
ever we are to call it, of the Earth in the
Deluge,
not, I
fay, that he was much concerned at it, per
haps juft the Contrary 5 and if God would drown
it
again, and as often as he thought fit, I do not
fee
by any thing I meet with in Satan s
Hiflory,
or in the Nature of him, that he would be at all
difturb d at it$ all that I can fee in it, that could
give Satan any Concern, would be that all his Fa
vourites were gone, and he had his Work to do over
again, to lay a Foundation for a new Conqueft in
the Generation that was to come$ But in this his
ProfpecT: was fair
enough, for why fhould he be
difcouraged, when he had now eight People to
work upon, who met with fuch Succefs when he
had
of the D E V I L. 145
had but two ? and why fliould he queftion break
ing in now where Nature was already vitiated
and corrupted, when he had before conquer d the
fame Nature, when in its
primitive ReHtude and
Purity, juft come out of the Hands of its Maker,
and fortify d with the Awe of his high and fo-*
lemn Command juft given them, and the threat-
ning of Death alfo annext to it, if broken?
But I
go back to the Affair of Babel : This
Confufion of Language or of Councils, take it
which way you will, as the firll
Difappoint-
ment that I find the Devil met with, in all his At
tempts and Practices upon Mankind, or upon
the new Creature, which I mentioned above 5 for
now he forefaw what would follow j namely, that
the People would feparate and fpread themfelves
over the whole Surface of the Earth, and a
thoufand new Scenes of Actions would appear^ in
which he therefore prepares himfelf to behave
as he fhould fee Occafion.
How the Devil learn d to fpeak all the Lan
guages that were now to be ufed, and how many
Languages they were, the feveral ancient Wri*
ters of the Devil s
Story have not yet determin
ed &amp;gt;
fomc tell us they were divided only into fif
teen, fome into feventy two, others into one hun
dred and eighty, and others again into feveral
Thoufands.
It alfo remains a doubt with mej and, I fuppofe,
will be fo with others alfo, whether Satan has yet
found out a Method to converfe with Mankind,
without the Help of Language and Words, or
not :
feeing Man has no other Medium of Con
verting, no not with himfelf: This I have not
time to enter upon here 5 however, this feems
plain to rne (viz.) that the Devil foon learn d to
make Mankind underfland him, whatever Lan*
gunge he fpoke, and no doubt but he found
L Ways
146 The HISTORY
Ways and Means to underftand them, whatever
Language they fpoke.
Alter the Confufion of Languages, the People
neceflarily forted themfelves into Families and
Tribes, every Family understanding their own
particular Speech, and that only j and thefe Fa
milies multiplying grew into Nations, and tho(e
Nations wanting Room, and feeking out Habi
tations wandred Come this Way, fome that, till
they found out Countries refbettively proper for
their fettling, and there they became a Kingdom,
fpreading and poflcfling (till more and more Land
as their People encrealed, till at laft the whole
Earth was fcarce
big enough for them : This pre-
fented Satan with an Opportunity to break in
upon their Morals at another Door, (viz.) their
Pride ; for Men being naturally Proud and Envi
ous, Nations and Tribes began to joflle with one
another for Room j cither one Nation enjoy d
better Accommodations, or had a better Soil or a
more favourable Climate than another 3 and thefe
being numerous and ftrong thru ft the other out,
and encroach d upon their Land -,
the other liking
their Situation, prepare for their Defence, and
fo began Oppreffion, Invafion, War, Battle and
Blood, Satan all the while beating the Drums,
and his Attendants clapping their Hands, as Men
do when they fet
Dogs on upon one another.
The bringing Mankind thus to JVar and Con-
fit/ion, as it was the fir ft Game the Devil play d
after the confounding of Languages and Divifions
at Babel) fo it was a Conqueft upon Mankind,
purely devilifri, born from Hell, and fo exactly
tinctured with Satan s
original Sin Ambition^ that
it
really transform\i Men into meer Devils j for
when is Man transformed into the very Image of
Satan himfelf, when is he turn d into a meer
Devil, if it is not when he is
fighting with his
fellow
of the DEVIL. 147
fellow Creatures and dipping his Hands in the
Blood of his own Kind ? Lee his Picture be
confider d, the Fire of Hell flames or fparkles
in his Eyes, a voracious Grin (its
upon his Coun
tenance , Rage and Fury diftort the Mufcles of
his Face , his Paflions agitate his whole Body, and
he is
metamorphos d from a comely Beauteous
angelic Creatureinto a Fury, a Satyr^
a terrible and
frightful Monfter, nay, into a Devil $ for Satan
himfelf is defcrib d by the fame Word which on
his very Account is
ehang d into a Subftantive,
and the Devils are call d Furies.
This fowing the Seeds of Strife in the World,
and bringing Nations to fight and make War
upon one another, would take up a great Part of
the Devil s
Hiftory, and abundance of extraor
dinary Things would occur in relating the par
ticulars y for there have been very great Conflagra
tions kindled in the World, by the Artifice of
Hell, under this Head, (viz.) of making War 5 in
which it has been the Devil s Mailer- piece, and
he has indeed ilicwn himfelf a Workman in it,
that he has wheedled Mankind into fl
range un
natural Notions of things, in order to propagate
and fupport the fighting Principle in the World j
fuch as Laws of War, fair
Fighting, behaving
like Men of Honour, fighting at the lad:
Drop,
and the like, by which killing and murdering is
underftood to be juftifiable. Virtue and a true
Greatnefs in Spirit is rated now by Rules which
God never appointed, and the Standard of Ho
nour is
quite different from that of Reafon and of
Nature :
Bravery is denominated not from a fear-
lefs undaunted Spirit in the jufl Defence of Life
and Liberty, but from a
daring Defiance of God
and Man, fighting, killing and treading under
Foot his fellow Creatures, at the ordinary Com-
majad of the Officer, whether it be right or wrong,
L i and
14* The HISTORY
and whether it be in a juft Defence of Life, and
our Country s Life, that is
Liberty, or whether
it be for the Support of Injury and Oppreffion.
A prudent avoiding caufelefs Quarrels is calFd
Cowardice, and to take an affront Bafenefs, and
Meanncfs of Spirit ; to refute fighting,&quot;and putting
Life at a Call on the Point of a Sword, a Practice
forbid by the Laws of God and of all
good
Government, is
yet call d Cowardice -,
and a Man
is bound to die duelling, or live and be laugh d at.
This trumping upthefe imaginary Things call d
Bravery and Gallantry, naming them Virtue and
Honour, is all from the Devil s new Management,
and his fubtil influencing the Minds of Men to
fly in the Face of God and Nature, and to act
againfl his Senfes j nor but for his Artifice in the
Management, could it be poflible that fuch In-
confidencies could go down with Mankind, or
they could pafs fuch abfurd Things among them
for reafoning ; for Example, A is found in Bed
with B s Wife, B is the Perfoninjur d, and there
fore offended, and coming into the Chamber with
his Sword in his Hand, A exclaims loudly, Why
Sir^ you- won t murder me^ will you ? as you are a&amp;gt;
Man of Honour let me rife and take my S-word.
A very good Story indeed ! fit for no body but
the Devil to put into any Man s Head; But fo
it is, B being put in mind, forfooth, that he is
a Man of Honcnr^ Harts back and muft ab the
honourable Part; fo he lets A get up, put on his
Clothes and take his Sword ; then they fight,
and B is kill d for his Honour ; whereas had the
Laws of God, of Nature and of Reafon taken
Place, the Adulterer and the Adulterefs fhould
have been taken Prifoners and carried before the
Judge, and being taken in the Fab, fhould have
been immediately fcntenc d, he to the Block and
he to the Stake, and the innocent abus d Hus-
4 band
of the DE VIL. 149
band had no Reafon to have run any Rifque o^
his Life for being made a Cuckold.
But thus has Satan abus d the Reafon ofMan -
y and
if a Man does me the greateft Injury in the World,
I mutt do my felf Juitice upon him, by venturing
my life
upon an even Lay with him, and muft fight
him upon equal Hazard, in which the injur d
Perfon is as often kill d as the Perfon offering the
Injury :
Suppofe now it be in the fame Cafe as
above^ a Man abufes my Wife, and then to give
me Satisfaction, tells me, he will fight me, which
the French call doing me Keafon \ No Sir^ (ay I, let
me lie withyour PVife too^ and then ifyou defere it^1may
fight you -,
then Iam upon even Terms with you ; but
this indeed is the Reafoning which the Devil has
brought Mankind too at this Day : But to go
back to the Subject, viz. the Devil bringing the
Nations to fall out, and to quarrel for Room in
the World, and fo to fight in order to difpofTefs
one another of their Settlements : This began at
a Time when certainly there were Places enough
in the World for every one to choofe in, and
therefore the Devil^ not the want of Elbow-
room, muft be the Occaiion of it j and tis carried
on ever fince, as apparently from the fame Intereft,
and by the fame original.
But we (hall meet with this Part again very often
in the Devil s
Story, and as we bring him farther on
in the Management of Mankind , I therefore lay it
by for the Prefent, and come to the next Steps the
Devil took with Mankind after the Confufion of
Languages, and this was in the Affair of Worlhip ;
It does not appear yet that ever the Devil was fo
bold, as either,
i. To fet himfelf up to be worftiip d as a God,
or which was ftill
worfe,
^. To perfuade Man to believe there was no
God at all to worfhip.
L Both
I 5 o The HISTORY
Both thefe are introduced fince the Deluge, one
indeed by the Der
oil^ who icon found Means to
fet himfelf up for a God in many Parts of the
World, and holds it to this Day 3 but the lafl is
brought in by the Invention of Man, in which
it mull bcconfefs d Man has out-fin d the Devil ;
for to do Satan jutlice, he never thought it could
ever pafs upon Mankind, or that any Thing fo
grofs would go down with them ; fo that, injhort^
thcfe modern Cafuifts, in the Reach of our Days,
have, Ifay^ out-iin d the Devil.
As then both thefe are modern Inventions, Sa
tan went on gradually, and being to work upon
human Nature by Stratagem, not by Force, it
would have been too grofs to have fet himfelf up
as an Object of Worihip at firlt, it was to be
done Step by Step 3 for Example.
I. It was fufficient to bring Mankind to a
Neglect of God, to worfhip him by halves,
and give little or no Regard to his Laws,
and fo grow loofe and immoral, indirect Con
tradiction to his Commands &amp;gt;
this would not
go down with them at firft, fo the Devil
went on gradually.
z. From a
Negligence Mn worshiping the true
GOD, he by Degrees introduc d the worfhip
of falfe GODS j and to introduce this he be
gan [with the Sun^ Moon, and Sfars, call d
in the holy Text the Hoft of Heaven 5 thefe
had greater Majefty upon them, and feem d
fitter to command the Homage of Mankind 5
fo it was not the hardeft Thing in the World,
to bring Men, when they had once forgot
ten the true God, to embrace the Worfhip
of fuch Gods as thofe.
J. Having thus debauch d their Principles in
Worfhip, and led them from the true and
only
ofthe DEVIL; 151
only Object of Wor/hip to a falfe, it was the
eafier to carry them on $ ib in a few Grada
tions more he brought them to downright
Idolatry, and even in that Idolatry he proceed
ed gradually too 5 for he began with awful
Names, fuch as were venerable in the
Thoughts of Men, as BAAL or BELL, which,
in Chaldaick and Hebrew^ fignifies Lord or
Sovereign, or Mighty and Magnificent, and
this was therefore a Name afcrib d at firft
to the true God&amp;gt; but afterwards they de-
fcended to make Images and Figures to re-
prelent him ,
and then they were call d by
the fame Name, as Baal^ Baalim, and after
wards Belly from which, by a p
hellifh
Dege
neracy, Saturn brought Mankind to adore
every Block of their own hewing, and to
worshipping Stocks, Stones, Monfters, Hob
goblins, and every fordid frightful Thing,
and at lall the Devil himfelf.
What Notions fome People may entertain of the
Forwardnefs of the firfl:
Ages of the World, to run
into Idolatry, I do not enquire here 5 I know they
tell us ftrange Things, of its
being the Product of
meer Nature, one remove from its
primitive State -
y
but I, who pretend to have ib
critically enquir d
into Satan s
Hiflory, can aflure you, and that
from very good Authority, that the Devil did
not find it fo eafy a tafk to obliterate the Know
ledge of the true God, in the Minds and Con-
fciences of Men, as thofe People fuggeft.
It is true he carried Things a great Length un
der the Patriarchal Government of the fidl Ages,
but ftill he was (Ixteen hundred Years bringing
it to pafs 5 and tho we have Reafon to believe
the old World, before the Flood was arrived to
a very great Height of Wickednefs, and Ovid
L 4 very
j 5 2 ^HISTORY
very nobly defcribes it
by the War of the fitans
againft Jupiter^ yet we do not read that ever Sa
tan was come to fuch a Length as to bring them
to Idolatry 3 indeed we do read of Wars car
ried on among them, whether it was one Nati
on againft another, or only Perfonal, we cannot
tell 3 But the World feem d to be fwallow d up in
a Life of Wickednefs, that is to fay, of Luxury
and Lewdnefs, Rapine and Violence, and there
were Giants among them, and Men of Renown,
that is to fay, Men fanVd for their mighty Va
lour, great A&ions of War we may fuppofe,
and their Strength, who perfonally oppofs d
others. We read ofno confiderable Wars indeed,
but tis not to be doubted but there was fuch Wars,
or elfe it is to be underftood that they iiv d (in
common) a Life fomewhat like the Brutes, the
Strong devouring the Weak 3 for the Text fays,
the whole Earth was filled with Violence, hunting
and tearing one another in Pieces, either for Do
minion or for Wealth, either for Ambition or for
Avarice, we know not well which.
Thus for the ojd Antediluvian World went,
and very wicked they were, there is no doubt of
that 3 but we have Reafon to believe that was no
Idolatry, the Devil had not brought them to that
Length yet :
perhaps it would ibon have follow d,
but the Deluge intervened.
After the Deluge, as / have faid^ he had all
his Work to do over again, and he went on by
the lame Steps 3 firft he brought them to Violence
and War, then to Qppreffion and Tyranny, then
to negle&of true Worfhip, then to falfe worfhip,
and then Idolatry by the meer natural Confe-
quence of the Thing 3 who were the firft Na
tion or People that fell from the Worfhip of the
true God, is
fomething hard to determine 3 the De-
yjl)
who certainly of all God s Creatures is beft able
of the DEVIL; 153
to inform us, having left us nothing upon Record
upon that Subject, but we have Reafon to be
lieve it was thus introduc d.
Nimrod was the Grandfon of Ham, Noah s
fecond Son, the fame who was curfed by his Fa
ther for expofing him in his Drunkennefs: This
Nimrod was the firft who it feems Satan pick d
out for a Hero : Here he infpir d him with am
bitious Thoughts, dreams of Empire, and hav
ing the Government of all the Reft, that is to
ay^ univcrfal Monarchy
-
9 the very fame Bait with
which he has plaid upon the Frailty of Princes,
and enfnard the greateft of them ever fince, even
from his moil Auguft Imperial Majefty KingM^-
rod the firft, to his moft Chriftian Majefty Louis
the XIV. and many a mighty Monarch between.
When thefe mighty Monarchs and Men of
Fame went off the Stage, the World had their
Memories in efteem many Ages after j and as
their great Aftions were no otherwife recorded
than by oral Tradition, and the Tongues and Me^
mories of fallible Men, Time and the Cuftom of
magnifying the paft Aftions of Kings, Men
foon fabl d up their Hiftories, Satan affiftmg^ into
Miracle and Wonder: Hence their Names were
had in Veneration more and more 3 Statues and Bu
boes repreicnting their Perfons and great Actions
were fet up in public Places, till from Heroes and
Champions they made Gods of them, and thus
(Satan prompting) the World was quickly fill d
with Idols.
This Nimrod is he, who according to the re*
ceived Opinion, tho I do not find Satan s
Hiftory
exactly concurring with it, was firft call d Eelus^
then Baal) and worfhip d in moft of the eaftem
Countries under thofe Names -,
fometimes with
Additions of Sir- names, according to the feveral
o^intries? or People, or Towps where he was
particu-.
154 The HIS TORY
particularly fct
up, as Baal Peor, Baal Zephon*
Baal Phegor, and in other Places plain Baal^ as
Jupiter in after Times had the like Additions j as
Jupiter Ammon, Jupiter Capitolinus^ Jupiter Pif-
t&amp;lt;jY, Jupiter FeretriuS) and about ten or twelve
Jupiters more.
1 rnuft acknowledge, that I think it was a Maf~
ter-piece of Hell to bring the World to Idola
try fo foon after they had had fuch an eminent
Example of the infinite Power of the true God,
as was feen in the Deluge, and particularly in the
Efcape of Noah in the Ark, to bring them (even
before Noah or his Sons were dead) to forget
whofe Hand it was, and give the Homage of the
World to a Name, and that a Name of a mortal
Man dead and rotten, who was famous for no
thing when he was alive but Blood and War -
y I
fay, to bring the World to fet up this Nothing,
this meer Name, nay the very Image and Picture
of him for a God^ it was firfl a Mark of moil
prodigious Stupidity in the whole Race of Men,
a monftrous Degeneracy from Nature, and even
from common Senfe &amp;gt;
and in the next Place twas
a token of an inexpreffible Craft and Subtilty in
the Devil) who had now gotten the People into
fo full and compleat a Management, that in ihort,
he could have brought them, by the fame Rule, to
have worfhip d any thing j and in a little while more,
did bring many of them to worfhip himfelf, plain
Devil as he was, and knowing him to be fuch.
As to the Antiquity of this horrible Defection
of Mankind, tho we do not find the beginning
of it
particularly recorded, yet we are certain it
was not long after the Confufion of Babel 5 for
Nimrod^ as is faid, was rio more than Noah s
great
Grandfon and Noah himfelf, I fuppofe, might be
alive fome Years after Nimrod was born &amp;gt;
and as
Nimrod was not long dead, before they forgot that
he
of the DEVIL. 155
he was a Tyrant and a Murtherer, and made a
Baal^ that is a Lord or Idol of him, I fay, he
was not long dead, for Nimrod was born in the
Year of the World 1
847, and built Babylon the
Year 1
879 5 and we find Terah the Father of A~
braham^ who liv d from the Year 1
879 was an Ido
later, as was doubtlefs Bethuel, who was Terab s
Grandfon &amp;gt;
for we find Laban, who was BethueFs
Son, was fo, and all this was during the Life of
the firft Poft-Diluvian Family, for Terab was born
within one hundred ninety three Years after the
Flood, and one hundred fifty feven Years before
Noah was dead ; and even Abram himfelf was
eight and fifty Years old before Noah died, and
yet Idolatry had been then, in all
probability,
above an hundred Years pradifed in the World.
N. B. It is worth Remark here, what a ter
rible Advantage the Devil gain d by the de
bauching poor Noah, and drawing him into
the Sin of Drunkennefs 5 for by this, as I
faid, he filenc d and flop d the Mouth of
the great Preacher of Righteoufnefs, that
Father and Patriarch of the whole World,
who not being able for the Shame of his
own foul Mifcarriage, to pretend to inftruft
or reprove the World any more, the Devil
took hold of them immediately, and for
want of a Prophet to warn and admonifh,
ran that little of Religion which there might
be left in Shem and Japhet^ quite out of the
World, and delug d them all in IDOLATRY.
How long the whole World may be faid to be
thus overwhelmed in Ignorance and Idolatry, we
may make fome tolerable guefs at by the Hiftory
of Abraham ; for it was not till God call d him
from his Father s Houfe, that any fuch Thing as a
Church
i 5 6 TfoHIS T O R Y
Church was eftablinYd in the World $ nor even
then, except in his own Family and Succeflors for
almoft four hundred Years after that Call ; and
till God brought the Ifraelites back out oF Egypt,
the whole World may be faid to be involved in
Idolatry and Devil worfhip.
So abfolute a Conqueft had the Devil made
over Mankind immediately after the Flood, and
all
taking its Rife and Beginning at the fatal De
feat ofNoab, who had he liv d untainted and in
vulnerable, as he had done for fix hundred Years
before, would have gone a great way to have
ilem d the Torrent or Wickednefs which broke
in upon Mankind &amp;gt;
and therefore the Devil^ I fay,
was very cunning and very much in the Right
of it, take him as he is a meer Devil^ to attack
Noah perfonally, and give him a Blow- fo foon.
It is true, the Devil did not immediately raze out
the Notion of Religion and of a GOD from
the Minds of Men, nor could he eafily fupprefs
the Principle of Worfhip and Homage to be paid
to a Sovereign Being, the Author of Nature and
Guide of the World &amp;gt;
the Devil faw this clearly
in the firft
Ages of the new World, and there
fore, as I have faid, he proceeded politically and
by Degrees : That it was fo, is evident from the
Story of Job and his three Friends, who, if we
may take it for a Hiftory, not a Fable, and may
judge of the Time of it
by the Length of Job s
Life, and by the Family of Eliphaz the femanite^
who it is manifeft was at lead Grandfon or Great
Grandfon to Efau Ifaac s eldefl Son, and by the
Language of Ablmilech King of Gerar to .Abra-
haW) and of Laban to Jacob^ both the Latter
being at the fame Time Idolaters &amp;gt;
I fay, if we
may judge of it
by all thefe, there were ftill
very
found Notions of Religion in the Minds of Men 5
nor could Satan with all his Cunning and Policy
deface
of the D EVIL. 157
deface thofe Ideas^ and root them out of the
Minds of the People.
And this put him upon taking new Meafures
to keep up his Intereft and prelerve the Hold
he got upon Mankind -,
and his Method was
like himfelf, fubtle and politick to the lall De
gree, as his whole Hiftory makes appear &amp;gt;
for fee
ing he found they could not but believe the Being
of a God, and that they would needs worfhip fome-
thing, it is evident, he had no Game left him to
play but this, namely, to fet up wrong Notions
of Worfhip, and bring them toafalfe Worfhip in-
ftead of a True, fuppofing the Object worfnip d
to be flill the fame.
To finifh this Stratagem, he firftinfinuates that
the true God was a terrible, a dreadful, unap
proachable Being 5 that to fee him was fo fright
ful, that it would be prefent Death ; that to wor
fhip him immediately, was a Prefumption which
would provoke his Wrath ; and that as he was a
confuming Fire in himfelf, fo he would burn up thofe
in his
Anger that dar d to offer up any Sacrifice to
him, but by the Interpolation of fome Medium
which might receive their Adorations in his Name.
Hence it occur d prefently, that fubordinate
Gods were to be found out and fet
up, to whom
the People might pay the Homage due to the
fuprcme God, and who they might worihip in
his Name } this I take from the moft ancient Ac
count of Idolatry in the World 5 nor indeed could
the Devil himfelf find out any other Reafon why
Men ihould Cannonife or rather Deify their Princes
and Men of Fame, and worfhip them after they
were dead, as if
they could fave them from Death
and Calamity, who were not able to fave them-
felves when they were alive ; much lefs could
Satan bring Men to fwallow fo
grofs, fo abfurd a
Thing as the bowing the Knee to a Stock or a
Stone,
I 5 8 The HISTORY
Stone, a Calf, an Ox5 a Lion, nay the Image or
Figure of a Calf, fuph as the IJraelites made at
Mount Sinaii and fay, Thefe be thy Gods, O Ifrael,
who brought tbce out of the Land of Egypt.
Having thus, I fay, brought them to fatisfy
themfelves that they worfhip d the true God and no
other, under the Figures and Appearances which
they made to reprefent him, it was eafy after that
to worfhip any thing for the true God j and thus
in a few Ages they worfhip d nothing but Idols,
even throughout the whole World 5 nor has the
Devil loft this hold in fome Parts of the World,
nay not in moft Parts of the World to this Dayj
He holds dill all the Eaftern Parts otAfea, and the
Southern Parts of Africa, and the Northern Parts
ofEurope, and in them the vaft Countries of China
and fartary. Perfect and India, Guinea^ Ethiopia,
Zanquebar, Congo, Angola, Monomotapa, &c. in
all which, except Ethiopia^ we find no Veftiges of
any other worfhip but that of Idols, Monfters,
and even the Devil himfelf 5 till after the very
coming of our Saviour, and even then, if it be
true that the Gofpel was preach d in the Indies
and China by St. ffomas, and in other remote
Countries by other of the Apoftles 5 we fee that
whatever Ground Satan loft, he feems to have
recovered it
again j and all AJia and Africa is
at prefent
overrun with Paganifm or Mahome-
tanifm, which I think of the two is rather the
worft y Befides all America, a Part of the World, as
fome fay, equal in Bignefs to all the other, in which
the Devil s
Kingdom was never interrupted from
its firft
being inhabited, whenever it was, to the
firft Difcovery of it
by the European Nations in
the (ixteenth Century.
In a Word, the Devil got what we may call
an entire Victory over Mankind, and drove the
Worfhip of the true God, in a Manner quite
out
of the DEVIL. 159
out of the World, forcing, as it were, his Maker
in a new kind of Creation, the old one proving
thus ineffe&ual to recover a certain Number by
Force and meer Omnipotence to return to their
Duty, ferve him and worfhip him 5 But of that
hereafter.

having, as I have faid in the preceding
Chapter, made, as it were, a full Conqueft of
Mankind, debauch d them all to Idolatry, and
brought them at lead to worfhipingthe true God
by the wretched Medium of corrupt and idola
trous Reprefentations &amp;gt;
God feem d to have no
true Servants or Worfhippers left in the World,
but if I may be allow d to fpeak fo, was oblig d, in
order to reftore the World to their Senfes again,
to call a felect Number out from among the reft,
who he himfelfundertook iTiould own his Godhead
or fupreme Authority, and worfhip him as he
requir d to be worfhip dj this, I fay, God was
oblig d to do, becaufe tis evident it has not been
done fo much by the Choice and Council of Men,
for Satan would have over-ruVd that Part9
as by
the Power and Energy of fome irrefiftible and
invincible Operation, and this our Divines give
high Names to 3 but be it what they will, it is the
fecond Defeat or Difappointment that the Devil
4 has
160 The HI ST O R Y
he met with in his Progrefs in the World j the
firft I have fpoken of already.
It is true, Satan very well underftood what
was threatn d to him in the original Promiic to
the Woman, immediately after the Fall, namely,
tboujhalt bruife his Head, Sec. but he did riot ex
pect it fo fuddenly, but thought bimfelf fure of
Mankind, till the Fullnefs of Time when the
Meffiah fhould comej and therefore it was a great
Surprize to him, to fee that Abraham being call d
was fo immediately received and eilablifh d, tho*
he did not fo
immediately follow the Voice that
directed him, yet in him, in his Loins was all
God s Church at that time contained.
In the calling Abraham, it is
eafy to fee that
there was no other way for God to form a
Church, that is to fay, to fingle out a People to
himfelf, as the World was then dated, but by
immediate Revelation and a Voice from Heaven :
All Mankind were gone over to the Enemy, ovef-
whelm d in Idolatry, in a Word, were engag d
to the Devil-, God Almighty, or as the Scrip
ture diftinguifhes \nm,the Lord, the true GOD, was
out of the Queflion ; Mankind knew little or
nothing of him, much lefs did they know any
thing of his Worfhip, or that there was fuch a
Being in the World.
Well might it be faid the Lord appeared to
Abraham, 6en. xii.
7. for if God had not ap-
pear d himlelf, he muft have fent a Meflenger
from Heaven, and perhaps it was fo too, for he had
not one true Servant or Worihiper that we
know of then on Earth, to fend on that Errand j
no Prophet, no Preacher of Righteoufnefs, Noah
was dead, and had been fo above feventeen Year j
and if he had not, his
preaching, as I obferved
after his great Mifcarriage, had but little Effet }
we are indeed told, that Noah left behind him
certain

Worfhip
of GOD, which were call d the Precepts ofNoah,
and remain d in the World for a
long Times tho*

Difficulty which Remains to be folv dj and this

Land of Canaan, gave him the Promife of it for

him to meddle with Abraham. This is certain

fome will
fuggeft that
the Command to Abraham to go and offer up his
Son Ifaac, was a
Temptation of the Devil, if pof-

Abraham had difobey d that Call, the new Fa
vourite had been overcome and made a Rebel of

Seed had been cutoff, and Abraham defeated 3 but
as the Text is
exprefs that GOD himfelf propofed
it to Abraham, I {hall not ftart the Suggeftions
of the Criticks, in Bar of the facred Oracle.
Be it one way or other, Abraham fhew d a
Hero-like Faith and
Courage, and if the Devil
had been the Author of it, he had feen himfelf
M
162 The HISTORY
difappointed in both his Views &amp;gt;
(i.)by Abraham s
ready and bold Compliance, as believing it to
be GOD S Command 5 and (i.) by the divine Coun
termand of the Execution, juft as the fatal Knife
was lifted up.
But if the Devil left Abraham, and made no
attack upon him, feeing him invulnerable, he made
himfelf amends upon the other Branch of his Fa
mily, his poor Nephew LOT &amp;gt; who, notwit (land
ing he was fo immediately under the particular
Care of Heaven, as that the Angel who was fent
to deftroy Sodom^ could do nothing till he was
out of it &amp;gt;
and who, tho after he had left Zoar,
and was retir d into a Cave to dwell, yet thefubtle
Devil found him out, deluded his two Daughters,
took an Advantage of the Fright they had been
in about Sodom and Gomorrah^ made them be
lieve the whole World was burnt too, as well
as thofe Cities, and that in fhort, they could
never have any Husbands, 6cc. and fo in their
abundant Concern to repeople the World, and
that the Race of Mankind might not be deftroy-
ed, they go and lie with their own Father-, the
Devil telling them doubtleis how to do it, by in
toxicating his Head with Wine 5 in all which
Story, whether they were not as drunk as their
Father, feems to be a Queition, or elfe
they could
not have fuppofed all the Men in the Earth were
confum d, when they knew that the little City
Zoar had been preferv d for their Sakes.
This now was the third Conqueil Satan ob-
tain d by the Guft of humane Appetite &amp;gt;
that is
to fay, once by Eating and twice by Drinking, or
Drunkennefs, and {till the laft was the worft and
moft fhameful &amp;gt;
for Lot^ however his Daughters
manag d him, could not pretend he did not un-
derfland what the Strength of Wine was 5 and
one would have thought after fo terrible a Judg
ment
of the DEVIL.
ment as that of Sodom was, which was, as we may
fay,
executed before his Face, his Thoughts
fhould have been too folemnly engag d in praif-
ing God for fparing his Life, to be made drunk,
and that two Nights together.
But the Devil pJay d his Game fure, he fet his
two Daughters to work, and as the Devil s In-
ftruments feldom fail, fo he fecur d his by that
hellifh Stratagem of deluding the Daughters, to
think all the World was confum d but they two
and their Father : To be fure the old Man could
not fufpecl: that his Daughters Defign was fo
wicked as indeed it was, or that they intended to
debauch him with Wine, and make him drink till
he knew not what he did.
Now the Devil having carried his Game here,
gain d a great Point ; for as there were but two re
ligious Families in the World before, from whence
a twofold Generation might be fuppoled to rife
religious and righteous like their Parents, (viz.)
that of Abraham and this of Lot ; this Crime
ruin d the Hopes of one of them &amp;gt;
it could no
more be (aid that juvt Lot was in Being, who
vex d his righteous Soul from Day to Day with
the wicked Behaviour of the People of Sodom $
righteous Lot was degenerated into drunken in-
ceituous Lot) LOT fallen from what he was, to be
a wicked and unrighteous Man -
9 no pattern of
Virtue, no Reprover of the Age, but a poor fal

more reprove or exhort, but look down and be
afham d, and nothing to do but to repent &amp;gt;
and
fee the poor mean Excufes of all the three.
Eve fays, The Serpent beguiled me^ and I did eat.
Noah lays, My Grand/on beguiFd m^ or the
Wind beguird me^ and I did drink.
M z Lot
i64 The HISTORY

It is obfervable, that as I faid above, Noah was
filenc d, and his Preaching at an
End,^
after that
one Action, fo the like may be faid of Lot ;
and
in fhort, you never hear one Word more of either
of them after it 3 as for Mankind, both wereufe-
lefs to them, and as to themfelves, we never read
of any of their Repentance, nor have we much
Reafon to believe they did repent.
From this Attack of the Devil upon Lot^ we
hear no more of the Devil being fo bufily em
ploy d as he had been before in the World; he
had indeed but little to do, for all the reft of the
World was his own, lull d alleep under the Witch
craft of Idolatry, and are fo ftill.
But it could not be long that the Devil lay
idle j as foon as God call d himfelf a People,
the Devil could not be at Reft till he attacked
them.
c
Wherever God fets up aHoufe ofPrayer,
c
The Devil always builds a Chapel there.
Abraham indeed went off the Stage free, and fo
did Ifaac too, they were a Kind of firft Rate
Saints , we do not fo much as read of any failing
they had, or of any Thing the &quot;Devil had ever
the Face to offer to them 3 no, or with Jacob
either, if you will excufe him for beguiling his
Brother Efau, of both his Birthright and his Blef-
fing, but he was bufy enough with all his Chil
dren &amp;gt;
for Example,
He fent Judah to his Sheep-{hearing, and
placed aWhore (famar) in his Way, in the Po(-
ture
of the DEVIL. 165
ture ofTemptation, fo made him commit In-
cefr. and Whoredom both together.
Hefent inceftuous Reubenio lie with his Father s
Concubine Billah.
He fent Dinah to the Ball, to dance with the
Sichemite Ladies, and play the Whore with
their Matter.
He enrag d Simeon and Levi^ at the fuppofed
Injury, and then prompted them to Revenge,
for which their Father heartily curfed them.
He fet them all
together to fall
upon poor
Jofeph^ fir ft to murther him intentionally,
and then actually fell him to the Midia-
nites.
He made them {hew the Party- coloured Coat,
and tell a lie to their Father, to make the
poor old Man believe Jofefh was kill d by a
Lion, &c.
He fent Potiphar s Wife to attack Jofeph s
Chaftity, and filFd her with Rage at the Dif-
appointment.
He taught Jofeph to fwear by the Life of Pha*
roab.
In a Word, he debauch d the whole Race, ex
cept Benjamin^ and never Man had fuch a Set of
Sons, fo wicked and fo notorious, after fo good
an Introduction into the World as they all of
them had, to be fure 5 for Jacob^ no doubt, gave
them as good Inftru&ion as the Circumitances
of his wandring Condition would allow him
to do.
We muft now confider the Devil and his Af
fairs in a quite differing Situation: When the
World firil
appeared peopled by the creating
Power of God, he had only Adam and Eve to
take care of, and I think he ply d his Time with
them to purpofe enough : After the Deluge he ha4

Noah only to pitch upon, and he quickly conquer d
him by the Inftigation of his Grand/on.
At the Building of Babel he guided them by
their acting all in a Body as one Man 3 fo that in
fhort he managed them with eafe, taking them as a
.Body politic j and we find they came into his Snare
as one Man &amp;gt;
but Now, the Children offfrael multi
plying in the Land oftheir Bondage, and God feem-
ing to fhew a particular Concern for them, the
Devil was obliged to new Meafures, Hand at a
Di(lance, and look on for fome Time.
The Egyptians were plagued even without his
Help, nor tho the cunning Artift, as I (aid, flood
and looked on, yet he durfl not meddle ; nor could
he make a few Lice, the lead and meancil of the
Armies of Infects raifed to afflict the Egyptians.
However, when he perceiv d that God refolv-
ed to bring the Ifraelites out, he prepared to at
tend them, to watch them, and be at Hand up
on all the wicked Occafions that might offer, as
if he had been fully fatisfied fuch Occafions would
offer, and that he fhould not fail to have an Op
portunity to draw them into fome Snare or another,
and that therefore it was his Bufinefsnot to be out
of the Way, but to be ready (as we fay) to make
his Market of them in the befl Manner he could :
How many Ways he attempted them, nay, how
many Times he conquered them in their Journey,
we {hall fee
prefently.
Firft he put them in a fright at Baal-Zephon^
where he thought he had drawn them into a Noofe,
and where he tent Pharoah and his Army to block
them up between the Mountains of Piahiroth
and the Red Sea j but there indeed Satan was
outwitted by Mofes, fo far as it
appeared to be
a humane Action, for he little
thought of their
going dry footed thro* the Sea, but depended up
on having them all cut in Pieces the next Morn
ing
of the DEVIL. 167
ing by the Egyptians 5 an eminent Proof, by the
Way^ that the Devil has no Knowledge of Events,
or any Infight into Futurity j nay that he has not
fo much as a fecond Sight, or knows to Day what
his Maker intends to do to Morrow j for had
Satan known that God intended to Ford them over
the Sea, if he had not been able to have prevent
ed the Miracle, he would certainly have prevent
ed the Efcape, by fending out Pharoah and his
Army time enough to have taken the Strand be
fore them, and fo have driven them to the Ne-
ceffity
of travelling on Foot round the North
Point of that Sea, by theWildernefs of Etan, where
he would have purui d and harrafs d them with his
Cavalry, and in all Probability have deftroy d them :
But the blind fhort-fighted Devil, perfectly in the
Dark, and unacquainted with Futurity, knew no
thing of the Matter, was as much deceived as
Pharoah himfelf, flood ftill
flattering himfelfwith
the Hopes of his Booty, and the Revenge he
fhould take upon them the next Morning j till he
faw the frighted Waves in an Uproar, and to his
utter Aftoniihment and Confufion faw the Paf-
fage laid open, and Mofes leading his vaft Army
in full March over the dry Space ^ nay even then
tis
very propable Satan did not know that if the
Egyptians follow d them, the Sea would return
upon and overwhelm them j for I can hardly
think fo hard of the Devil himfelf, that if he had,
he would have fuffer d, much lefs
prompted Pha
roah to follow the Chafe at fuch an Expence
-
y fo
that either he mufl be an ignorant unforefeeing
Devil, or a very ungrateful falfe Devil to his
Friends the Egyptians.
I am enclin d alfo to the more charitable Opini
on of Satan too, becaufe the Efcape of the Ifraetites
was really a Triumph over himfelf5 for theWar was
certainly his, or at lead he was auxiliary to Pharoah^
M 4 it
168 The HISTORY
it was a
Victory over Hell and Egypt toge
ther, and he would never have fuffer d the Dif-
grace, if he had known it beforehand -&amp;gt;
that is to
lay, tho he could not have prevented the Efcape
of Ifrael) or the
dividing the Water, yet he might
have wairn d the Egyptians, and cautioned them
not to venture in after them.
But we fhall fee a great many weak Steps
taken by the Devil in the Affair of this very Peo
ple
and their forty Years Wandring in the Wil-
tiernefsj and tho he was in fome things fuccefs-
ful, and wheedled them into many foolifh and
miferable Murmurings and Wranglings agajnft
God, and Mutinies againft poor Mofe^ yet the
Devil was oftentimes baulk d and difappointed &amp;gt;
and
tis for this Reafon that I choofe to finifh the firft
Part of his Hiftory with the particular Relation
of his Behaviour among the Jews, becaufe alfo,
we do not find any extraordinary Things happen
ing any where elfe in the World for above one
thoufand five hundred Years, no Variety, jio Re
volutions 5 all the Red of Mankind lay ft ill under
his Yoke, quietly fubmitted to his Government,
did jufl as he bad them, worfhip d every Idol
he fee
up, and in a Word, he had no Difficulty
with any Body but the Jews, and for this Reafon,
I
fay, this Part of his Story will be the more life-
ful and
inftru&ing.
To return therefore to M&fes and his
dividing
the Red Sea , that the People went over or thro
it., that we have the facred
Hiftory for; but how

for, or I know not where you will find a true
Accobnt of it, at leaft not in Print.

But
of the DEVIL.
ut when he had Day-Light for it, and view d
the next Day s Work, I make no Queftion but all
Hell felt the Surprife, the Prey being thus fnatch d
out of their Hands unexpe&edly. Tis true the
Egyptians Holt was lent to him in their Room, but
that was not what he aim d at 5 for he was fure
enough of them his own Way, and if it was not
juft at that Tiwe^ yet he knew what and who they
were -
y but as he had devour d the whole Jfraelt-
tijh Hoft in his Imagination, to the Tune of at
leaft a Million and a half of Souls &amp;gt;
Men., Wo
men and Children j it was, no doubt, a great Di
appointment to the Devil to mifs of his Prey, and to
fee them all
triumphing on the other Side in Safety.
It is true, Satan s Annals do not mention this
Defeat, for Hiilorians are generally backward to
regifter their own Misfortunes $ but as we have
an Account of the Fa6b from other Hands, fo
as we cannot queftion the Truth of it j the Na
ture of the Thing will tell us it was a Difappoint-
ment to the Devil, and a very great one too.
I cannot but obferve here, that I think this
Part of the Devil s
Story very entertaining, ber
caufe of the great Variety of Incidents which ap
pear in every Part of it &amp;gt;
fometimes he is like a
hunted Fox, curvetting and counter-running to
avoid his
being purfued&quot;
and found out, while at
the fame time he is
carrying on his fecret Defigns
to draw the People he pretends to manage, into
fpme Snare or other to their Hurt 5 at another
time, tho the Comparifon is a little too low for
his Dignity, like a
Monkey that has done Mil-
chief, and who making his own Efcape fits and
chatters at a Diftance, as if he had triump d in
what he had done 5 fo Satan, when he had drawn
them in to worfhip a Calf, to offer
ftrange Fire,

them in their Diftrefs, kept at a Diftancc, as i
he look d on with Satisfaction to fee them Burnt*
fwallow d up, fwept away, and the like 5 as the
feveral Stories relate.
His indefatigable Vigilance is, on the other
hand, a ufeful Caveat, as well as an improving
View to us &amp;gt;
no (boner is he routed and cxpos d,
defeated and difappointed in one Enterprise, but
he begins another, and, like a cunning Gladiator,
warily defends himfelf, and boldly attacks his Ene
my at the fame time. Thus we fee him, up and down,
conquering and conquered, thro this whole Part
of his Story, till at laft he receives a total De
feat -
9 of which you fhall hear in its place : In the
mean time, let us take up his Story again at the
Red Sea9 where he receiv d a great Blow, inilead
of which he expected a compleat Victory &amp;gt;
for
doubtlefs the Devil and the King of Mgypt too,
thought of nothing but Conqueft at Piahiroth.
However, tho the Triumph of the Ifraelites
over the Egyptians muft needs be a great Morti
fication to the Devil, and exafperated him very
much, yet the Confequence was only this, viz.
that Satan^ like an Enemy who is baulk d and
defeated, but not overcome, redoubles his Rage,
and reinforces his Army, and what the Egyptians
could not do for him, he refolves to do for him
felf5 in order then to take his Opportunity for
what Mifchief might offer, being defeated, and
provok d, I fay, at the Slur that was put upon him,
he refolves to follow them into the Wildernefs,
and many a vile Prank he plaid them there &amp;gt;
as
firft, he ftraitens them for Water, and makes
them murmur againft GOD, and againft- Mofes^
within a very few Days, nay, Hours, of their
great Deliverance of all.
Nor was this all, but in lefs than one Year more
we find them, (at his Inftigation too) fetting up
4 a golden
of t^ DEVIL: 171
a golden Calf^ and making all the People dance
about it at Mount Sinai $ even when God himfelf
had but juft before appear d to them in the Ter
rors of a burning Fire upon the Top of the
Mountain j and what was the Pretence ? Truly,
nothing but that they had loft Mofes, who ufed
to be their Guide, and he had hid himfelf in the
Mount, and had not been feen in forty Days, fo
that they could not tell what was become of him.
This put them all into Confufion $ a poor Pre
tence indeed, to turn them all back to Idolatry !
but the watchful Devil took the Hint, pufh d the
Advantage, and infinuated that they (hould never
fee Mofes again, that he was certainly devour d by
venturing too near the Flafhes of Fire in the
Mount, and prefuming upon the Liberty he had
taken before j in a word, that God had deftroyed
Mofes,
or he was ftarved to Death for want of
Food, having been forty Days and forty Nights
abfent.
All thefe were, it s true, in themfelves moft
foolifh Suggeftions, confidering Mofes was ad
mitted to the Vifion of God, and that God had
been pleafed to appear to him in the moft inti
mate manner &amp;gt;
that as they might depend God
would not deftroy his faithful Servant, fo they
might have concluded he was able to fupport his
Being without Food as long as he thought fit $
but to a People fo eafy to believe any thing, what
could be too grofs for the Devil to perfuade them
to?
A People who could dance round a Calf, and
call it their God, might do any things that could
fay to one another, that this was the Great JE
HOVAH, that brought them out of the Land of E-
gypt ; and that within fo few Days after God s
miraculous Appearance to them, and for them 5 I
fay, fuch a People were really fitted to be im-
pofed
The H I S T O R Y
pofed upon, nothing could be too grofs for
them.
This was indeed his firft confiderable Experi
ment upon them as a People , or a as Body
-
y and
the Truth is, his Affairs required it, for &atanj
\vho had been a Succefsful Devil in moil of his
Attempts upon Mankind, could hardly doubt of
Succefs in any thing after he had carried his Point
at Mount Sinai : To bring them to Idolatry in the
very Face of their Deliverer, and juft
after their
Deliverance ! It was more aftonifhing in the main
than even their paffing the Red Sea : In a Word,
the Devil s whole Hiilory does not furnifh us with
3. Story equally furpriting.
And how was poor Aaron bewilder d in it too ?
He that was A/0/w s Partner in all the great Things
that Mofes did in Pharaoh s
Sight, and that was
appointed to be his Affiftant and Oracle, or Ora
tor rather) upon all public Ocean*ons ; that he,
above all the reft, fhould come into this abfurd
and ridiculous Propofal, he that was fingled out
for the facred Priefthood, for him to defile his
holy Hands with a polluted abominable Sacrifice,
and with making the Idol for them too, (for tis
plain that he made it,) how monftrous it was !
And fee what an Anlwer he gives to his Bro
ther Mofes,
how weak ! how fimple ! I did fo and
fe, indeed^ \ bad them bring the Ear-rings, &c.
and I caft the Gold into the Fire, and // came out
tbis Calf. Ridiculous ! as if the Calf came out
by meer fortuitous Adventure, without a Mould
to caft it in j which could not be fuppofed : And
if it had not come out ib without a Mould, Mofes
would certainly have known of it j had Aaron
been innocent, he would have anfwered after
quite another manner, and told Mofes honeftly
that the whole Body of the People came to him
in a Fright, that they forced him to make them
of the DEVIL; 173
an Idol $ which he did, by making firft a pro
per Mould to caft it in, and then taking the pro
per Metal to caft it from : That indeed he had
finn d in fo doing, but that he was mobb d into
it, and the People terrified him, perhaps they
threatned to kill him ; and if he had added, that
the Dwil prompting his Fear beguiPd him, he
had faid
nothing but what was certainly true$ for
if it was in Satan s Power to make the People in-
folent and outrageous enough to threaten and bully
the old venerable Prophet (for he was not yet a
Prieft) who was the Brother of their Oracle Mo-
feS) and had been Partner with him in fo many of
his Commiffions -,
I fay, if he cou d bring up the
Paffions of the People to a Height to be rude and
unmannerly to him (Aaron) and perhaps to threat
en and infult him, he may be eafily iiippos d to
be able to intimidate Aaron^ and terrify him into
a Compliance.
See this
cunning Agent, when he has Man s
Deftruciion in his View, how fecurely he ac~b !
he never wants a handle 5 the beft of Men have
one weak place or other, and he always finds it
out, takes the Advantage of it, and conquers
them by one Artifice or another 5 only take it
with you as you go, tis
always by Stratagem^
never by Force $ a Proof that he is not empower d
to ufe Violence : He may tempt, and he does
prevail $ but tis all
Legerdemain^ tis all Craft and
Artifice, he is ftill ArajBoXn, the Calumniator and
Deceiver, that is, the Mifreprefenter $ he mifre-
prefents Man to GOD, and mifreprefents GOD to
Man\ alfo he mifreprefents Things i he puts falfe
Colours, and then manages the Eye to fee them
with an irnperfec~b View, raifing Clouds and Fogs
to intercept our Sight 5 in fhort, he deceives all
our Senies, and impofes upon us in Things which
otherwife would be the caueft to difcern and judge
of. And
174 The HISTORY
This indeed is in part the Benefit of the Devil s
Hiflory, to let us fee that he has ufed the fame Me
thod all
along y and that ever fince he has had
any thing to do with Mankind, he has pra&is d
upon them with Stratagem and Cunning j alfo
tis obfervable that he has carried his Point bet
ter that way than he would have done by Fury
and Violence, if he had been allowed to make ufe
of it 5 for by his Power indeed he might have
laid the World defolate, and made a Heap of
Rubbifh of it
long ago &amp;gt; but, as I have obferved
before, that would not have anfwered his Ends
half fo well, for by deflroying Men he would
have made Martyrs, and fent abundance of good
Men to Heaven, who would much rather have
died, than yielded to ferve him, and, as he aim
ed to have it, to fall down and worfhip him &amp;gt;
I
fay, he would have made Martyrs, and that not
a few: But this was none of Satan s Bufinefs;
his Defign lies
quite another Way&amp;gt;
hisBufinefsis
to make Meny#, not to make them fuffer-
y to
make Devils of them, not Saints ; to delude them,
and draw them away from their Maker, not fend
them away to him 5 and therefore he works by
Stratagem, not by Force.
We are now come to his Story, as it relates to
the Jewijh Church in the Wildernefs, and to the
Children of Ifrael in their travelling Circumftan-
ces 3 and this was the firft Scene of publick Ma
nagement that the Devil had upon his Hands in
the World &amp;gt;
for, as I have faid, /;// now, he dealt
with Mankind either in their feparate Condition,
one by one, or elfe carried all before him,engrof-
fing whole Nations in hisSyftems of Idolatry, and
overwhelming them in an ignorant Definition.
But having now a whole People as it were
fnatch d away from him, taken out of his Go
vernment, and, which was ftill worfe3 having a
View
of the DEVIL; 175
View of a Kingdom being fet up independent of
him, and fuperior to his Authority, it is not to
be wondred at if he endeavour d to overthrow
them in the Infancy of their Conftitution, and
tried all poffible Arts to bring them back into
his own Hands again.
He found them not only carried away from the
Country where they were even in his Clutches,
furrounded with Idols, and where we have Rea-
fon to believe the greater! part of them were pol
luted with the Idolatry of the Egyptians \ for we
do not read of any ftated Worfhip which they
had of their own, or if they did worfhip the
true God, we fcarce know in what manner they
did it y they had no Law given them, nothing
but the Covenant of Circumcifion, and even Mo-
fes himfelf had not ftrictly obferv d that, till he was
frighted into it 3 we read of no Sacrifices among
them, no Feafts were ordain d, no folemn Wor
fhip appointed, and how, or in what manner they
perform d their Homage, we know not 5 thePaf-
Fover was not ordain d till
juft at their coming a-
way j fo that there was not much Religion among
them, at leaft that we have any Account of&amp;gt;
and
we may fuppofe the Devil was pretty eafy with
them all the while they were in theHoufe of their
Bondage.
But. flow, to have a Million of People fetch d
out of his Hands, as it were all at once, and to
have the immediate Power of Heaven engaged
in it, and that Satan faw evidently God had fin-
gled them out in a miraculous manner to favour
them, and call them his own ; this allarm d him
at once, and therefore he refolves to follow them,
lay dole Siege to them, and take all the Meafures
poffible to bring them to rebel againfl,
and dif-
obey GOD, that he might be provok d to deftroy
them &amp;gt;
and how near he went to bring it to pafs,
we fhall fee prefently.
This
I 7 6 The HISTORY
This making a Calf, and paying an idolatrous
Worfhip to it (for they afted the Heathens and
Idolaters, not in the Jetting up the Calf only,
but in the manner of their
Worshiping, viz.
Dancing and Mufick^ Things they had not been-
acquainted with in the Worihip of the true God)
I mention here, to obferve how the Devil not
only impofed upon their
Principles, but upon
their Senfes too 3 as if the awful Majefty of Hea
ven, whofe Glory they had feen in Mount Sinai,
where they flood, and whofe Pillar of Cloud and
Fire was their Guide and Prote&ion, would be
worfhip d by dancing round a Calf! and that not
a living Creature, or a real Calf, but the mere
Image of a Calf caft in Gold, or, as fome think,
in Brafs gilded over.
But this was the DeviFs Way with Mankind,
namely, to impofe upon their Senfes, and bring
them into the grofleft Follies and Abfurdities 5 and
then, having firft made them Fools, it was much
the eafier to make them Offenders.
In this very manner he a&ed with them thro
all the Courfe of their Wildernefs Travels 5 for
as they were led by the Hand like Children, de
fended by Omnipotence, fed by Miracles, in-
flrufted
immediately from Heaven, and in all
things had Mofes for their Guide 3 they had no
room to mifcarry, but by acting the greater! Ab
furdities, and committing the grcateft Follies in
Nature j and even thefe, the Devil brought them
to be guilty of, in a
furprifing manner: i. As
GOD himfelf reliev d them in
every Exigence,
and fupply d them in every Want, one would
think twas impoffible they fhould be ever brought
to
queftion either his
Willingnefs or his Ability,
and yet they really objected againft both j which
was indeed very provoking, and I doubt not,
that when the Devil had brought them to aft
m
of tfo DEVIL: 177
in fuch a prepofterous Manner, he really hoped
and believed God would be provok d effectually :
The Teftimonies of his Care of them, and Abi
lity to fupply them, were miraculous and unde
niable 5 he gave them Water from the Rock,
Bread from the Air, fent. the Fowls to feed them
with Flefh, and fupported them all the Way by
Miracles &amp;gt;
their Health was preferv d, none were
lick among them, their clothes did not wear
out, nor their Shoes grow old upon their Feet &amp;gt;
could any thing be more abfurd, than to doubt
whether he could provide for them who had ne
ver let them want for fo many Years ?
But the Devil managed them in fpight of Mi
racles j nor did he ever give them over till he had
brought fix hundred thoufand of them to pro
voke God fo highly that he would not fuffer a-
bove two of them to go into the Land of Pro-
mifej fo that in fhort, Satan gained his Point as
to that Generation, for all their CarcafTes fell in
the Wildernefs. Let us take but a fhort View-
to what a Height he brought em, and in what
a rude, abfurd Manner they acted 3 how he fee
them upon murmuring upon every Occafion,
now for Water, then for Bread j nay, they mur
mured at their Bread when they had it 5 Our Soul
Ioaths this light Bread.
He fow d the Seeds of Church-Rebellion in
the Sons of Aaron^ and made Nadab and Abihu
offer ftrange Fire till
they were flrangely con-
fumed by Fire for the doing it.
He fet them a
complaining at Taberah, and a
lufting for Flefti at the firft three Days Journey
from Mount Sinai.
He planted Envy in the Hearts of Miriam and
Aaron, againft the Authority of Mofes^ to pre
tend GOD had fpoke by them as well as by him,
till he humbled the Father, and made a Leper of
the Daughter. N He
z.7 s The HISTORY
He debauched ten of the Spies, frighted them
with fham Appearances of Things, when they
went out to fearch the Land j and made them
fright the whole People out of their Underftand-
ing as well as
Duty, for which fix hundred thou-
fond of their Carcafles fell in the Wildernefs.
He rais d the Rebellion of Korah, and the two
hundred and fifty Princes, till he brought them
to be fwallowed up alive.
He put Mofes into a Paffion at Meribah, and
ruffled the Temper of the meekeft Man upon
Earth, by which he made both him and Aaron
forfeit their Share of the Promife, and be ihut
out from the Holy Land.
He rais d a Mutiny among them when they
travelled from Mount Hor^ till
they brought fiery
Serpents among them to deftroy them.
He tried to make Baalim the Prophet curfe
them, but there the Devil was diiappointed :
However, he brought the Midianites to debauch
them with Women, as in the Cafe of Zimri and
Casff.
He tempted Jlcban with the Wedge of Gold,
and the Babyknijh Garment, that he might take
of the accurfed thing, and be deftroy d.
He tempted the whole People, not effectually
to drive out the curfed Inhabitants of the Land
of Promife, that they might remain, and be
Goads in their Sides, till at laft
they often op-
prefs d them for their Idolatry j and, which was
worfe, debauched them to Idolatry.
He prompted the Benjamites to refufe Satisfac
tion to the People, in the Cafe of the Wicked-
nefs of the Men of Gibeah, to the Deilrudion
of the whole Tribe, four hundred Men excepted
in the Rock Rimmon.
At laft he tempted them to rejecl:
the The
ocracy of their Maker, and call upon Samuel
2. to
of the D E V I L. 179
to make them a King &amp;gt;
and moft of thofe King
3
he made Plagues and Sorrows to them in their
time, as you {hall hear in their Order.
Thus he plagued the whole Body of the Peo
ple continually, making them fin againft God,
and bring Judgments upon themfelves, to the con-
fuming fome Millions of them, fir It and laft, by
the Vengeance of their Maker.
As he did with the whole Congregation, fo
he did with their Rulers, andieveralof the fudges,
who were made Inlfouments to deliver the Peo
ple, yet ^ere drawn into fnares by this fubnl
Serpent, to ruin themfeives or the People they
had delivered.
He tempted Gideon to make an Ephod, con
trary to the Law of the Tabernacle, and made
the Children of Ifraei go a whoring (that is, a
worihiping) after ir.
He tempted Sampfon to debauch himfelf with
a Harlot, and betray his own happy Secret to a
Whore, at the Expence &amp;gt;f both his&quot;
Eyes, and at
laft of his Life.
He tempted Eli s Sons to lie with the Women,
in the very Doors of the Tabernacle, when they
came to bring their Offerings to the Prieft 5 and
he tempted poor Eli to connive at them, or
not fufficiently reprove them.
He tempted the People to carry the Ark of
God into the Camp, that it
might fall into the
Hands of the Pbiliftines. And
He tempted Uzzi to reach out his Hand to
hold it
up &amp;gt;
as if he that had preferved it in the
Houfe of Dagon the Idol of the Pbiliftines^ couldv
not keep it from falling out of the Cart.
When the People had gotten a King, he im
mediately fet to work in diverle Ways to bring
that King to load them with Plagues and Cala
mities not a few.
N * He
I8o The HISTORY
tie tempted Saul to (pare the King of Ama-
contrary to God s
exprefs Command.
He not tempted Saul only, but poflefled him
with an evil Spirit, by which he was left to way
ward Difpoiitions, and was forced to have it fiddl d
out of him with a Minftrel.
He tempted Saul with a Spirit of Difcontent,
and with a Spirit of Envy at poor David^ to
hunt him like a Partridge upon the Mountains.
He tempted Saul with a Spirit of Divination,
and fent him to a Witch to enquire of Samuel
for him ; as if God would help him when
he was dead, that had forfaken him when he was
alive.
After that, he tempted him to kill himfelf, on a
Pretence that he might not fall into the Hands
of the Uncircumcifed 5 as if Self-Murther was
not half fo bad, either for Sin againfl God, or
Di(grace among Men, as
being taken Prifoner by
a Philiftine ! A Piece of Madnefs none but the
Devil could have brought Mankind to fubmit to,
tho fome Ages after that, he made it a Fafhion
among the Romans..
After Saul was dead, and David came to the
Throne, by how much he was a Man chofen and
particularly favoured by Heaven, the Devil fell
upon him with the more Vigour, attacked him
fo many Ways, and conquered him fo
very often,
that as no Man was fo good a King, fo hardly
any good King was ever a vvorfe Man &amp;gt;
in many
Cafes one would have almoft thought the Devil
had made Sport with David^ to fhew how eafily
he could overthrow the belt Man God could
choofe of the whole Congregation.
He made him diilruft his Benefactor fo much
as to
feign himfelf mad before the King of Gathy
when he had fled to him for Shelter.

He made him march with his four hundred
Gut-throats, to cut off poor Nabal, and all hi^s

Sheep-fhcarers.
He made him, for his Word s fake, give Ziba
half his Mailer s Eftate for his Treachery, after
he knew he had been the Traitor, and betray d
poor Mephibojhetb for the fake of it &amp;gt;

4
To break his Word, and therefore broke his Oath.
Then he tempted him to the ridiculous Pro
ject of numbring the People, tho agaimt God s
exprefs Command 3 a Thing Joab himfelf was not
wicked enough to do, till David and the Devil
forc d him to it.
And to make him compleatly wicked, he car
ried him to the Top of his Houfe, and fhew d
him a naked Lady bathing her felf in her Garden,
in which it
appear d that the Devil knew David
too well, and what was the particular Sin of his
Inclination &amp;gt;
and fo took him by the Right Handle -
9
drawing him at once into the Sins oMurtber and
Adultery.
Then, that he might not quite give him over,
(tho Davids
Repentance for the kit Sin kept the
Devil off for a while) when he could attack him
no farther
perfonally he fell
upon him in his Fa
mily, and made him as miferable as he could de-
fire him to be, in his Children, three of whom he
brought to Deftruftion before his Face, and ano
ther after his Death.
Firir., he tempted Ammon to raviih his Sifter
Tamar j fo, there was an End of her (poor Girl!)
as to this World, for we never hear any more of
her.
N 5 Then
is*
Then he tempted Abfalom to murther his Bro
ther Amnon^ in Revenge for Tamar s Maiden
head.
Then he made Joab run Avfalom thro the Bo
dy, contrary to David s Command.
And after David s Death he brought Adonija,
(weak Man !
) to the Block, for ufurping King
Solomon s Throne.
As to Abfalom, he tempted him to Rebellion,
and railing War againft; his Father, to the turn
ing him fhamefully out of Jerufakw, and aim oft
out of the Kingdom.
He tempted him, for David s farther Mortifica
tion, to lie with his Father s Wives, in the Face
of the whole City &amp;gt;
and had AcbitopbeTs honeft
Council been follow d, he had certainly fcnt him
to Sleep with his Fathers, long before his time-
But there Satan and Achitophel were both out
witted together.
Thro all the Reigns of the feveral SucceMbrs
of David) the Devil took care to carry on his
own Game, to the continual infulttng the Mea-
fures which God himfelf had taken for the efta-
blifhing his People in the World, and efpecially
as a Church j till at lad he fo effectually debauch d
them to Idolatry j that Crime which of all others
was moft provoking to GOD, as it was carrying
the People away from their
Allegiance, and tranf-
pofing the Homage they ow d God their Ma
ker, to a contemptible Block of Wood, or an
Image of a brute Beaft -,
and this how fordid and
brutilh foever it was in] it felf, yetfo did his Ar
tifice prevail among them, that, firft or laft, he
brought them all into it, the ten Tribes as well
as the two Tribes &amp;gt;
till at laft God, himfelf was
provoked to unchurch them, gave them up to
their Enemies, and the few that were left of them,
after incredible Slaughters and Defolation, were
hurried
of the D E V I L. 183
hurried away, fome into fariafy^ and others into
Babylon^ from whence very few, of that few that
were carried away, ever found their Way Home
again 5 and fome, when they might have come,
would not accept of it, but continued there to
the very coming of the Meflrah. See Epiftles of
St. James and of St. Peter^ at the Beginning.
But to look a little back upon this Part (
for
it cannot be omitted, it makes fo confiderable a
Part of the Devil s
Hiftory) I mean his drawing .
God s
People, Kings and all, into all the Sins and
Mifchiefs which gradually contributed to their
Deftruchon.
Firft, (for he began immediately with the very
befl and wifeft of the Race) he drew in King So-
lomon, in the mid ft of all his Zeal for the build
ing God s Houfe, and for the making the moft
glorious and magnificent Appearance for God s
Worfhip that ever the World faw &amp;gt;
I
fay, in the
middle of all this, he drew him into fuch im
moderate and infatiable an Appetite for Women,
as to fet up the firft, and perhaps the greateft Se
raglio of Whores that ever any Prince in the
World had, or pretended to before &amp;gt;
nay, and to
bring whoring to much into Reputation, that,
as the Text fays, feven hundred of them were
Princefles.j that is to fay, Ladies of Quality :
Not as the Grand Seigniors, and Great Moguls,
(other Princes of the Eaftern World ) have fince
pra&ifed, namely, to pick up their moft beauti
ful Slaves j but thefe, it ieems, were Women of
Rank, King s
Daughters, as Pharaoh s
Daughter,
and the Daughters of the Princes and prime Men
among the
Moabites^ -Ammonites^ Zidonians, Hit-
tites^ dec. i
Kings xi. i .
Nor was this all &amp;gt;
but as he drew him into the
Love of thefe forbidden Women (for fuch they
were, as to their Nation, as well as Number) fo he
N 4 cnfnar d
1 84 The H I S T O R Y
enfnar d him by thofe Women to a Familiarity
with their Worihip; and by degrees brought that
famous Prince (famous for his Wifdom) to be the
freateft
and mohSimpos d-upon old Fool in the
V^orld y Bowing down to thofe Idols by the In-
t icing of hjs Whores, whom he had abhorr d and
detelted in his Youth, as dishonouring that God
for whom, and for whofe Worlhip he had finiih d
and dedicated the moil magnificent Building and
Temple in the World :
Nothing but tl^ffinci-
ble Subtlety of this Arch Devil could ever have
brought fuch a Man as Solomon to fuch a Dege
neracy of Manners, and to fuch MeanneiTes 5 no,
not the Devil himfelf, without the Aflifhmce of
his Whores, nor the Whores themfelves, without
the Devil to help them.
As to Solomon^ Satan had made Conqueft enough
there, we need hear no more of him 3 the next
Advance he made,, was in the Perfon of his Son
Rehoboam ; had not the Devil prompted his Pride
and tyrannical Humour, he would never have
given the People fuch an Anfwer as he did &amp;gt;
and
when he faw a Fellow at the Head of them too
whom he knew wanted and waited for an Occafion
to raife a Rebellion, and had ripened up the Peo
ples Humour to the Occafion : Well might the
Text call it
liftening to the Council of the young
Heads j that it was indeed with a Vengeance ! but
thofe young Heads too were a&amp;lt;5ted
by an old t&amp;gt;e-
id!, who for his Craft is called, as I have obferv d,
I\K Old Serpent.
Having thus pav d the Way, Jeroboam revolts.
So far God had directed him -
y for the Text fays
exprefly, faking in the firft Perfon of GOD
himfelf, This Thing is
of Me.
But tho GOD might appoint Jeroboam to be
King, .(that is to fay, of ten Tribes,) yet GOD
did not appoint him to fet up the two Calves in
the
of the DEVIL; is 5
the two extreme Parts of the Land, viz. in Dan^
and in Bethel; that was Jeroboam s own doing,
and done on purpofe to keep the People from
falling
back to Rehobcam^ by being obliged to go
to Jerufakm to the publick Worfhip : And the
Text adds, Jeroboam made Ifraelto fin. This was
indeed a Mafter-piece of the Devil s
Policy, and it
was effectual to anfwer the End, nothing could
have been more to the Purpofe &amp;gt;
what Reafon he
had to expec~b the People would fo univerfally
come into it, and be fo well fatisfied with a
couple of Calves, inftead of the true Worfhip of
GOD at JeriffaIem-,01 what Arts and Management
he (Satan) made ufe of afterwards, to bring the
People in, to join with fuch a Delufion, that we
find but little of in all the Annals of Satan; not
is it much to the Cafe : Tis certain the Devil
found a flrange kind of Propenfity to worfhip-
ing Idols rooted in the Temper of that whole
People, even from their firft breaking away from
the Egyptian Bondage 5 fo that he had nothing to
do but to work upon the old Stock, and propa
gate the Crime that he found was fo natural to
them. And this is Satan s
general Way of work
ing, not with them only, but with us alfo, and
with all the World, even then, and ever flnce.
When he had thus fecur d Jeroboam s Revolt,
we need not trace him among his SuccefTors &amp;gt;
for
the fame Reafon of State that held for thefetting
up the Calves at Bethel and Dan^ held good for
the keeping them up, to all Jeroboam s
Pofterity j
nor had they one good King ever after &amp;gt;
even
JehU) who call d his Friends to come and fee his
Zeal for the Lord^ and who fulfill d the Threat-
nings of God upon Ahab and his Family, and up
on Queen Jezabel and her Offspring, and knew
nil the while that he was executing the Judgment
of the true God upon an idolatrous Race 3 yet
he
iS6 TAeHlS T O R Y
he would not part with his Calves, but would
have thought it to have been parting with his
Kingdom, and that as the People would have
gone up to Jerufalcm to worfhip, fa they would
at the fame Time have transfcr d their civil Obe
dience to the King of Judab^ (whofe Right it
really was, as far as they could claim by Birth and
right Line) ; fo that by the way, Satan any more
than other Politicians, is not for the jus divinum
of lineal Succeffion, or what we call
hereditary
Right, any farther than ferves for his Purpofe.
Thus Satan ridded his Hands of ten of the
twelve Tribes j let us now fee how he went on
with the reft, for his Work was now brought
into a narrower Compafs j the Church of God
was now reduc d to two Tribes, except a few re
ligious People, who feparated from the Schifm of
Jeroboam^ and came and planted themfelves among
the Tribes of Judah and Benjamin : The firft
thing
the Devil did after this, was to foment a War
between the two Kings, while Judah was govern
ed by a Boy or Youth, Abija by Name, and he
none of the beft neither \ but God s Time was
not come, and the Devil receiv d a great Difap-
pointments when Jeroboam was fo
entirely over
thrown } that if the Records of thofe Ages do not
miftake, no lefs than foocoo Men of Ifrael were
Idll d, fuch a Slaughter, that one would think the
Army of Judab, had they known how to improve
as well as gain a Vi&ory, might have brought all
the reft back again, and have intirely reduc d
the Houfe of Jeroboam and the ten Tribes that
follow d him to their Obedience 5 nay they did
take a great deal of the Country from them, and
among the reft Bethel it felf -
9 and yet fo cunningly
did Satan manage, that the King of Judah,
who
was himfelf a wicked King, and perhaps an Ido
later in his Heart, did not take down the golden
Calf
of the DEVIL; is 7
Calf that Jeroboam had there, no nor deftroy the
Idolatry it
felf, fo that in fhort, his Viclory figni-
fied nothing.
From hence to the Captivity, we find the De
vil bufy with the Kings of Judah, efpecially the
beft of them&amp;gt; as for fuch as Mana/etb^and thofe
who tranfgrefs d by the general Tenor of their
Lives, thofe he had no great trouble with.
But fuch as Afa^Jebofbaphat) Hezek ab^ and Jo-
iah^ he hung about them and their Courts, till he
brought every one of them into fomeMifchief or
another.
As fir ft, good King AJla^ of whom the Scrip
ture fays, his Heart was perfeft all his
Days, yet
this fubtle Spirit, that could break in upon him no
where elfe, tempted him when the King of Ifrael
came out againft him, to fend to hire Benhadad
the King of Syria to help him &amp;gt;
as if GOD who
had before enabled him to conquer the Ethiopi-
ans^ with an Army of ten hundred thou&nd Men,
could not have faved him from the King of the
ten Tribes.
In the fame manner he tempted Jeho/bdpbat to
join with that wicked King Ahab againft the
King of 3770, and alfo to marry his Son to Ahab s
Daughter, which was fatal to Jehojbaphat^ and to
his
Pofterity.
Again, He tempted Hezekiah to fhew all his
Riches to the King of Babylon s
MefTengers 3 and
who can doubt, but that he (Satan) is to be un-
derftood by the wicked Spirit which flood before
the Lord, 2, Chron. xviii. 20. and offered his
Service to entice Ahab the King of Ifrael to come
out to Battle to his Ruin, by being a lying Spi
rit in the Mouths of all his Prophets 5 and who
for that Time had a fpecial Commiflion, as he had
another Time in the Cafe of Job ? and indeed it was
aCommiffion fit for no body but the DeviI: Thou
jlmlt
188 The HISTORY
jhalt entice him, and thoufloalt alfo prevail: Go out
and do even fo, f.zi.
Even good Jofiah himfelf, of wliom it is re
corded, that like him there was no King before himy
neither after him arofe there any like him, 2,
Kings
xxiii. 16. yet the Devil never left him with his Ma
chinations, till
rinding he could not tempt him to
any Thing wicked in his Government, he tempted
or mov d him to a needlefs War with the King
of Egypt, in which he loft his Life.
From the Death of this good King, the Devil
prevailed fo with the whole Nation of the Jews,
and brought them to fuch an incorrigible Pitch
of Wickednefs, that God gave them up, for-
fook his Habitation of Glory, the Temple, which
he fuffer d to be fpoil d firft, then burnt and de-
niolinYd 5 deftroying the whole Nation of the
Jews, except a fmall Number that were left, and
thofe the Enemy carried away into Captivity.
Nor was he Satisfied with this general Deftruc-
tion of the whole People of Ifrael, for the tdn
Tribes were gone before &amp;gt;
but he folio w d them
even into their Captivity 5 thofe that fled
away to
Egypt, which they tell us were feventy thoufand,
he firfl
corrupted, and then they were deftroyed
there upon the Overthrow of Egypt, by the fame
King of Babylon.
Alfo he went very near to have them rooted
out, young and old, Man, Woman and Child, who
were in Captivity in Babylon, by the Miniftry of
that true Agent of Hell, Haman the Agagite-, but
there Satan met with a
Difappointment too, as in
the Story of /&/&amp;lt;?r,
which was but the fourth that
he had met with, in all his Management fince the
Creation 3 I fay, there he was difoppointed, and
his prime Minifter Haman was exalted, as he de-
Having
EVIL. IS9
Having thus far traced the Government and
Dominion of the Devil^ from the Creation of Man
to the Captivity &amp;gt;
I think I
may call upon him to
fet up his Standard of univerfal Empire, at that
Period 5 it feem d juft then as if God had really for-
faken the Earth, and given the entire Dominion
of Mankind up to his outrageous Enemy the De
vil -
y for excepting the few Israelites which were
left in the Territories of the King of Babylon, and
they were but a few &amp;gt;
I fay, except among them,
there was not one Corner of the World left where
the true God was call d upon, or his Dominion
fo much as acknowledg d $ all the World was
buried in Idolatry, and that of fo many horrid
Kinds, that one would think, the Light of Rca-
fon fhould have convinced Mankind, that he who
exafted fuch bloody Sacrifices as that of Moloch^
and fuch a bloody cutting themfelves with Knives,
as the Priefls of Baal did, could not be a GOD, a
good and beneficent Being, but mutt be a cruel,
voracious and devouring Devil, whofe End was
not the Good, but the Deftruction of his Crea
tures : But to fuch a Height wns the blind dement
ed World arriv d to at that Time, that in thefc
fordid and corrupt Ways, they went on worfhip-
ing dumb Idols, and offering human Sacrifices
to them, and in a Word, committing all the moil
horrid and abfurd Abominations that they were
capable of, or that the Devil could prompt them
to, till Heaven was again put, as it were, to the
Neceflity of bringing about a Revolution, in fa
vour of his own forfaken People, by Miracle and
Surprize, as he had done before.
We come therefore to the Reftoration or Re
turn of the Captivity : Had Satan been able to
have afted any thing by Force, as 1 have obferv d
before, all the Princes and Powers of the World,
having been, as they really were, at his Devotion,
he
tpo The HI ST O R Y
he might eafily have made ufe of them, arm d
all the World againft the Jews, and prevented
the Rebuilding the Temple, and even the Return
of the Captivity.
But now the Devil s Power manifeftly receiv
ed a Check, and the Hand of God appeared in it,
and that he was refolv d to reeftabliih his People
the Jews, and to have a fecond Temple built :
the Devil) who knew the Extent of his own
Power too well, and what Limitations were laid
upon him, flood ftill as it were looking on, and
not daring to oppofe the Return of the Capti
vity, which he very well knew had been prophe-
iied, and would come to pafs.
He did indeed make fome little
Oppofition to
the Building, and to the fortifying the City^ but
as it was to no Purpofe, fo he was foon obliged to
give it over \ and thus the Captivity being re-
turn d, and the Temple rebuilt, the People of the
Jews encreafed and multiplied to an infinite Num
ber and Strength $ and from this Time we may
fay, the Power of the Devil rather declin d and
decreased, than went on with Succefs, as it had
done before j It is true the Jews fell into Sects and
Errors, and Divifions of many Kinds, after the
Return from the Captivity, and no doubt the
Devil had a great Hand in thofe Divifions j but
he could never bring them back to Idolatry, and
his not being able to do that, made him turn his
Hand fo
many Ways to plague and opprefs them j
as
particularly by Antlochus the Great , who
brought the Abomination of Defolation into the
holy Place -,
and there the Devil triumphed over
them for fome Time 5 but they were deliver d
many Ways, till at lail they came peaceably un
der the Protection rather than the Dominion of
the Roman Empire : When Herod the Great go-
vern d them as a King, and reedified, nay almoft
rebuilt

rebuilt their Temple, with fo great an Expence
and Magnificence, that he made it, as fome fay,
greater and more glorious than that of Solomon s^
tho^ that I take to be a great Fable, to fay
no worfe of it.
In this Condition the Jewijb Church flood,
when the Fullnefs of Time, as tis call d in
Scrip
ture, was come j and the DeviI was kept at Bay,
tho he had made fome Encroachments upon
them as above 3 for there was a glorious Rem
nant of Saints among them, fuch as old Zacha-
rias the Father of John the Baptift, and old Si&quot;
meon^ who waited for the Salvation of Ifraeli I
fay, in this Condition the Jewijli Church flood
when the Mejpah came into the World, which
was fuch another mortal Stab to the Thrones and
Principalities infernal, as that of which I
havefpo-
ken already in Chap. III. at the Creation of Man &amp;gt;
and therefore with this I break off the Antiquities
of the Devil s
Hiftory, or the antient Part of his
Kingdom ; for from hence downward we fhall
find his Empire has declin d gradually j and tho*
by his wonderful Addrefs, his
prodigious Applica
tion, and the Vigilance and Fidelity of his Inftru-
ments, as well human as infernal and diabolical,
and of the Human as well the Ecclefiaflick as
the Secular &amp;gt;
he has many Times retriev d what
he has loft, and fometimes bid fair for recovering
the universal Empire he once poflefs d over Man
kind 5 yet he has been ftill defeated again, repulft
and beaten back, and his Kingdom has greatly
declin d in many Parts of the World 5 and efpe-
cially in the Northern Parts, except Great Bri
tain-, and how he has politically maintained his
Intereft and encreafed his Dominion among the
wife and righteous Generation that we cohabit
with and among, will be the Subject of the mo

CHAP. I.
I
Have examined the Antiquities of Satan s
Hiltory in the former Part of this Work,
and brought his Affairs down from the Crea
tion, as far as to our blefTed Chriftian Times -,
efpecially to the Coming of the Me/pah, v/hen one
would think the Devil could have nothing to do
among us. I have indeed but touch d at fome
Things which might have admitted of a farther
Defcripuon of Satan s Affairs, and the Particulars
of which we may all come to a farther
Knowledge
of hereafter 5 yet I think I have fpoken to the
material Part of his Conduct, as it relates to his
Empire in this World: What has happened to
his more fublimated Government, and his Ange
lic
Capacities, I fhall have an Qccafion to touch
at in feveral folid Particulars as we go along.
The
of the DEVIL. 193
The Mejffiah was now born&amp;gt;
the
Fulnefs of Time
*wa$ come, that the old Serpent was to have his
Head broken, that is to fay, his Empire or Domi
nion over Man, which he gain d by the Fall o r
our firft Father and Mother in Paradife, received.
a Downfal or Overthrow.
It is worth observing) in order to confirm what
I have already mention d of the Limitation of
Satan s Power, that not only his Angelic Jtrength
feems to have received a farther Blow upon the
Coming of the Son of God into the World, but
he feems to have had a Blow upon his Intellects &amp;gt;
his Serpentine Craft and Devil-like Subtihy feems
to have been circumfcrib d and cut Ihort $ and in-
flead of his being fo cunning a Fellow as before,
when, as Ifold, tis evident he outwitted all Man
kind, not only Eve, Cain, Noah, Lot, and all
the Patriarchs, but even Nations of Men, and
that in their pubiick Capacity j and thereby led
them into abfurd and ridiculous Things, fuch as
the Building of Babel, and deifying and worfhip-
ing their Kings* when dead and rotten &amp;gt;
idolizing
Beafts, Stocks, Stones, any firing, and even Nothing ;
and in a Word, when he manag d Mankind juit
as he pleafed.
Now and from this Time forward he appeared
a weak, foolifh, ignorant Devil, compared to
what he was before j He was upon alrnoil every
Occafion refifted, difappointed, baulk d and de
feated, efpecially in all his Attempts to thwart
or croft the Miflion and Miniftry of the Meffiab,
while he was upon Earth, and fometimes upon
other and very mean Occafions too.
And firft, how fooliih a Project was it, and
how below Satan s celebrated Artifice in like Cafes,
to put Herod upon fending to kill the poor in
nocent Children in Bethlehem, in hopes to deftroy
the Infant ? for I take it for granted, it was the
O Devil
194 the Modern HISTORY
Devil put into Herod s
Thoughts that Executi
on, how fimpte and foolifh foever 5 now we mull
allow him to be very ignorant of the Nativity
himfelf, or elfe he might eafily have guided his
Friend Herod to the Place where the Infant was.
This iliev/s that either the Devil is in general
ignorant as we are, of what is to come in the
World, before it is
really come to pafs ; and con-
fcquently can foretcl nothing, no not fo much as
our famous old Merlin or Mother Shiptcn did, or
elfe that great Event was hid from him by an im
mediate Power fuperior to his, which I cannot
think neither, confidcring how much he was con-
cern d in it, and how certainly he knew that it
was once to come to pafs.
But be that as it will, tis certain the Dtvil
knew nothing where Chrift was born, or when 5
nor was he able to direct Herod to find him out,
and therefore put him upon that foolifh, as well as
cruel Order, to kill all the Children, that he might
be fure to deilroy the MeJJtah among the reft.
The next fimple Step that the Devil .took^
and indeed the moft foolifh one that he could
ever be charged with, unworthy the very Dig
nity of a Devil) and below the Underitanding
that he always was allow d to act with, was that
of coming to tempt the MeJJiah in the Wilder-
nefs -,
it is certain, and he own d it himfelf after
wards, upon many Occafions, that the Devil
knew our Saviour to be the Son of God &amp;gt;
and
tis as certain that he knew, that as fitch he could
have no Power or Advantage over him 3 how
fooliih then was it in him to attack him in that
Manner, if thou beeft the Son of GOD ?
why he
knew him to be the Son of GOD well enough j
he faid fo afterwards, / know thee who thou art^
the holy One of GOD j how then could he be fo
weak a Devil as to fay, if thou art^ then do/0 and fo ?
3
The
of the DEVIL, 195
The Cafe is
plain, the Devil, tho he knew
him to be the Son of GOD, did not fully
know
the Myftery ofthe Incarnation $ nor did he know
how far the Inanition of Chrift extended, and
whether, as Man, he was not fubject to fall us
Mam was, tho his referv d Godhead might be
ftill immaculate and pure&amp;gt;
and upon this Foot, as
he would leave no Method untried, he attempts
him three Times, one immediately after another &amp;gt;
but then, finding himfelf diiappointed he fled.
This evidently proves that the Devil was igno
rant of the great Myftery of Godlinefs, as tie
Text calls /&amp;gt;,
God manifeft in the Fleih, and there*-
fore made that fooliih Attempt upon Chrift, think
ing to have conquer d his human Nature as ca
pable of Sin, which it was not&amp;gt;
and at this Rc-
pulfe Hell groan d, the whole Army of regimen
ted Devils receiv d a Wound, and felt the Shock
of it y twas a iecond Overthrow to them, they
had had a long Chain of Succefs, carried a devilijb
Conqueft over the greateft Part of the Creation
of GOD 5 but now they were cut fhort, the Seed
of the Woman was now come to break the Serpent*s
Head, that is^ to cut fhort his Power, to con
tract the Limits of his Kingdom, and in a Word,
to dethrone him in the World : No doubt the
Devil receiv d a Shock, for you find him always
afterward, crying out in a horrible Manner, when
ever Chrift met with him, or elfe very humble
and fubmiffivc, as when he begg d leave to go into
the Herd of Swine, a Thing he has often done
fince.
Defeated here, the firft
Stratagem I find him
concern d in after it, was his entring into Judas,
and putting him upon betraying Chrift to the
Chief Prieftj but here again he was entirely mif-
taken, for he did not fee, as much a Devil as he
was, what the Event would be 5 but when he
O came
I 9 6 The Modern HISTORY
came to know, that if Chrift was put to Death,
he would become a Propitiatory and be the great
Sacrifice of Mankind, fo to refcue the fallen Race
from that Death they had incurred the Penalty
of, by the Fall, that this was the fulfilling of
all
Scripture Prophefy, and that thus it was that
Chrift was to be the End of the Law, I fay, as
foon as he perceiv d this, he ftrove all he could to
prevent ir, and difturb d Pilate s Wife in her Sleep,
in order to fet her upon her Husband to hinder
his delivering him up to the Jews
-
y for then, and
not till then, he knew how Chrift was to vanquifh
Hell by the Power of his Crofs.
Thus the Devil was difappointed and expofed
in every Step he took, and as he now plainly
faw his Kingdom declining, and even the tem
poral Kingdom of Chrift, rifing up upon the
Ruins of his (Satan s) Power , hefeem d to retreat
into his own Region the Air, and to confult there
\vith his fellow Devils^ what Meafures he ihould
take next to preferve his Dominion among Men &amp;gt;
Here it was that he refolv d upon that truly hel-
lifli
Thing calPd Perfecution, by which, tho* he
protfd a footijh Devil in that too, he flatter d him-
felf he fhould be able to deftroy God s Church,
and root out its ProfefTors from the Earth, even
almoft as foon as it was eftablifli d &amp;gt;
whereas on the
contrary, Heaven counter-a6ted him there too,
and tho he arm d the whole Roman Empire againft
the Chriftians, that is fay^ the whole World,
and they were fallen upon every where, with all
the Fury and Rage of fome of the moft flaming
Tyrants that the World ever faw, of whom Nero
was the firft 9 yet in fpight of Hell, GOD made all
the Blood, which the Devil caus d to be fpilt, to
befimen Ecckfix,;
and the DEVIL had the Morti
fication to fee, that the Number of Chriftians en-
creafed even under the very Means he made ufe
of
of the DEVIL, 197
of to root them out and defcroy them : This
was the Cafe thro the Reign of all the Roman
Emperors, for the fir ft three hundred, Years after
Chriit.
Having thus tried all the Methods that bell
fuited his Inclination, I mean thofe of Blood and
Death, complicated with Tortures and all Kinds
of Cruelty, and that for fo long a Stage of Time
as above 5 the Devil all on a iuddain, as if glut
ted with Blood, and fatiated with Definition,
fits ftill and becomes a peaceable Spectator for n
good while; as if he either found himfelf unable,
or had no Difpofition to hinder the Progrefs of
Chriftianity in the firft Ages of its Settlement
in the World : In this interval the Chriftian
Church was eftablifh d under Conftantine^ Re
ligion flourifhed in Peace, and under the moft
perfect Tranquillity : The Devil feem d to be at a
Lofs what he fhould do next, and Things began
to look as if Satan s Kingdom was at an End 3 but
he foon let them fee that he was the fame indefa
tigable Devil that ever he was, and the Profperi-
ty of the Church J
gave him a large Field of Ac
tion; for knowing the Difpofition of Mankind to
Quarrel and Difpute, the univerfal Paffion rooted
in Nature, efpecially among the Church-Men
for Precedency and Dominion, he fell to work
with them immediately j fo that turning rheTables,
and reafluming the Subtilty and Cra^, which, I
fay, he feem d to have loft in the former four
hundred Years, he gain d more Ground in the
next Ages of the Church, and went farther to
wards reftoring his Power and Empire in the
World, and towards overthrowing that very
Church which was fo lately eftablifh d, than all
he had done by Fire and Blood before.
His Policy now feem d to be edg d with Re-
fentment for the Miftakes he had made; as if the
O 3 Devil
The Modern HISTORY
Devil looking back with Anger at himfelf, to fee
what a Fool he had been to expect to crufh Re
ligion by Perfecution, rejoyc d for having difco-
ver d that Liberty and Dominion was the only
way
to ruin the Church, not Fire and Faggot;
and that he had nothing to do but to give tjie
zealous People their utrnoft Liberty in Religion,
only fowing Error and Variety of Opinion among
them, and they would bring Fire and Faggot in
fail enough among themfelves.
It mull be confeis d thefe were devilifli Poli
ticks 5 and fo fure was the Aim, and fo certain
was the Devil to hit his Mark by them, that we
find he not only did not fail then, but the fame
hellifh Methods have prevailed ftill, and will do
fo to the End of the World. Nor had the De
vil ever a better Game to play than this, for the
Ruin of Religion, as we fhall have room to
fhew in many Examples, befides that of the Dif-
fenters in England^ who are evidently weaken d by
the late Toleration: Whether the Devil had any
hand in baiting his Hook with an A of Parlia
ment or no, Hiftory is filent, but tis too evident
he has catch d the Fifh by it 5 and if the honeit
Church o England does not in Pity and Chriltian
Charity to the Diflenters, itraighten her Hand
a little, I cannot but fear the Devil will gain his
Point, and the Diflenter will be undone by it.
Upon this new foot of Politicks the Devil
began with the Emperors themfelves :
Arlus^
the Father of the Hercticks of that Age, having
broach d his Opinions, and jftbamjius the ortho
dox Bifhop of the Ealt oppofing him, the Devil
no fooner faw the Door open to Strife and Inipo-
fition, but he thriift himfelf in, and raifing the
Quarrel up to a fuited
Degree of Rage and Spleen.,
he involved the good Emperor himfelf in it firft,
and Aihznafitts was bamfh d and recall d, and ba-
nifh d
of the D E VI L, 199
niih d and recalled again, feveral times, as Error
ran high, and as the Devil either got or loll
Ground : After Conftantine^ the next Emperor
was a Child of his own, (Arlan) and then
the Court came all into the Quarrel, as Courts
often do, and then the Arians and the Orthodox
perfecuted one another as furiouily as the Pagans
perfecuted them all before. To fuch a Height
the Devil brought his Conquefl in the very In
fancy of the Queftion, and to much did he pre
vail over the true Chriftianity of the Primitive
Church, even before they had cnjoy d the Li
berty of the pure Worfhip twenty Years.
Flufh d with this Succefs, the Devil made one
Pufh for the reitoring Paganifm^ and bringing on
the old Worfhip of the Heathen Idols and Tem
ples 5 but like our King James II. he drove too
hard, and Julian had fo provok d the whole Ro
man Empire, which was generally at that time
become Chriftian, that had the Apoftate liv d,
he would not have been able to have held the
Throne 5 and as he was cut off in his Begin
ning, Paganifm expired with him, and the Devil
himfelf might have cry d out, as Julian did,
and with much more Propriety, Ficifti
Gali-
leane.
Jovian^ the next Emperor, being a glorious
Chriftian, and a very good and great Man, the
Devil abdicated for a while, and left the Chrifti-
an Armies to re-eftabliili the Orthodox Faith;
nor could he bring the Chriftians to a Breach
again among themfelves a great while after.
However, Time and a diligent Devil did the
Work at lad, and when the Emperors concern
ing themfelves one way or other, did not appear
fufficicnt to anfwer his End, he chang d Hands
again, and went to work with the Clergy : To
fet the Doctors effectually together by the Ears, he
4 threw
2oo The Modern HISTORY
threw in the new Notion of Primacy among
them, for a Bone of Contention 5 the Bait took,
the Priefts fwallow d it
eagerly down, and the
Devil, a cunningcr Fifherman than ever St. Peter
was, ftruck them (as the Anglers call it) with a
quick Hand, and hung them faft
upon the Hook.
Having them thus in his Clutches, and they
being now, as we may fay, his own, they took
their Mcafures afterwards from him, and moil
obediently followed his Directions &amp;gt;
nay, I will
not fay but he may have had pretty much the
Management of the whole Society ever fince, of
what Profeffion or Party foever they may have
been, \vith Exception only to the Reverend and
Right Reverend among our felves.
The Sacred, as above, being thus hook d in,
and the DEVIL being at the Head of their Af
fairs, Matters went on moll glorioufly his own
way , firft, the Biihops fell to bandying and Party-
making for the Superiority, as heartily as ever
Temporal Tyrants did for Dominion, and took as
black and devilifh Methods to carry it on, as the
worft of thofe Tyrants ever had done before
them.
At la ft Satan declared for the Roman Pontiff,
and that upon excellent Conditions, in the Reign
of the Emperor Mauritius &amp;gt;
for Boniface^ who
had long contended for the Title of Supreme,
fell into a Treaty with Phocasj Captain of the
Emperor s Guards , whether the Bargain was
from Hell or not, let any one judge, the Condi
tions abfolutely entitle the Devil to the Honour
of making the Contract, viz. That Phocas firft
murthering his Mailer (the Emperor) and his Sons,
Boniface mould countenance the Treafon, and
declare him Emperor j and in Return, Phocas
fhould acknowledge the Primacy of the Church
of Rim?) and declare Boniface univerfal Bifliop,
A blcfr
of the DEVIL; 201
A blefled Compact ! which at once fet the Devil
at the Head of Affairs in the Chriflian World,
as well Spiritual as Temporal, Ecclefiaftick and
Civil. Since the Conqueft over Eve in Para-
dife, by which Death and the DEVIL, Hand in
Hand, eftablifh d their firft Empire upon Earth,
the Devil never gain d a more important Point
than he gain d at this time.
He had indeed profpered in his Affairs tolerably
well for fome time before this, and his Intereft
among the Clergy had got Ground for fome Ages j
but that was indeed a fecret Management, was
carried on privately, and with Difficulty 5 as in
lowing Difcord and Faction among the People,
perplexing the Councils of their Princes, and fe-
cretly wheedling in with the dignified Clergy.
Alfo he had raifed abundance of little Church-
Rebellions, by fetting up Hereticks of feveral
Kinds, and railing them Favourers among the
Clergy, fuch as Ebion^ Cerintbius^ PelagiuS) and
others.
He had drawn in the BHhops of Rome to fet
up the ridiculous Pageantry of the KEY &amp;gt;
and
while he, the DEVIL, fet open the Gates of Hell
to them all, fet them upon locking up the Gates
of Heaven, and giving the Bifhop the Key 5 a
Cheat which, as
grofs as it was, the DEVIL fo
gilded over, or fo blinded the Age to receive it,
that like Gideon s
Ephod, all the Catholick World
went a whoring after the Idol $ and the Bifhop
of Rome fent more Fools to the Devil by it than
ever he pretended to let into Heaven, though he
open d the Door as wide as his Key was able to
do.
The Story of this Key being given to the Bi-
ihop of Rome by St. Peter^ (who, by the way,
iiever had it himfelf,) and of its
being loft by
Somebody or other, (the Devil it feems did not
5
tell
The Modern HISTORY
tell them who) and its
being found again by a
Lombard Soldier in the Army of King Antbaris^
who attempting to cut it with his Knife, was
miraculoufly forced to direct the Wound to him-
felf, and cut his own Throat j that King Antkarh
and his Nobles happened to fee the Fellow do it,
and were converted to Chriftianity by it, and that
the King fent the Key, with another made like
it, to Pope PelagiuS) then Bifhop of Rome, who
thereupon aflum d the Power of opening and
(hutting Heaven s Gates &amp;gt;
and he afterwards fet&amp;gt;
ting a Price or Toll upon the Entrance, as we
do here at paffing a Turn-pike 5 thefe fine things,
I fay, were fuccefsfully managed for fome Years
before this I am now (peaking of, and the Devil
got a great deal of Ground by it too 3 but now
he triumph d openly, and having fet up a Mur-
therer upon the temporal Throne, and a Church
Emperor upon the Ecclefiaftic Throne, and both
of his own choofing, the Devil may be faid to
begin his new Kingdom from this Epocha, and
call it the Reftoration.
Since this time indeed the Devil s Affairs went
very merrily on, and the Clergy brought fo ma
ny Gewgaws into their Worfhip, and fuch devililh
Principles were mixt with that which we calPd
the Chriftian Faith, that in a Word, from this
Time the Bifhop of Rome commenced IVkore of
Babylon, in all the mod exprefs Terms that could
be ipnagin d ;
Tyranny of the word fort crept
into the Pontificate, Errors of all forts into
the Profeffion, and they proceeded from one
thing to another, till the very Popes, for fo the
Bifhop of Rome was now called, by way of Di-
flan&ion $ I fay, the Popes themfelves, their fpi-
ritual Guides, profefs d openly to confederate with
the Devil, and to carry on a perfonal and private
Correfpondence with him at the fame time, tak
ing
of the DEVIL; 20$
ing upon them the Title of ChrirVs Vicar, and
the infallible Guide of the Confciences of Chri-
ilians.
This we have fundry Inftatices of in fome merry
Popes,who, if Fame lies &amp;lt;tf,were Sorcerers, Magici
ans, had familiar Spirits, and immediate Conver-
fation with the Devil, as well vifibly as inviilbly,
and by this means became what we call Devils
incarnate :
Upon this account it is that I have
left the Converfation that palles between Devils
and Men to this Place, as well becaufe I believe
it differs much now in his modern State, from
what it was in his antient State, and therefore
that which moffc concerns us belongs rather to
this part of his Hiitory j as alfo becaufe, as I am
now writing to the prefent Age, I choofe to bring
the moil fignificant Parts of his Hiftory, efpeci-
ally as they relate to our felves, into that Part of
Time that we are mofl concerned in.
The Devil had once, as I obferv d before, the
univerfal Monarchy or Government of Mankind
in himfelf, and I doubt not but in that flourifh-
ing State of his Affairs, he governed them like
what he is
(viz.) an abfolute Tyrant &amp;gt;
during this
theocracy of his, for Satan is calTd the God of this
World, he did not familiarize himfelf to Man
kind fo much, as he finds Occafion to do now,
there was not then fo much need of it j he govern
ed then with an abfolute Sway&amp;gt;
he had his Ora
cles, where he gave Audience to his Votaries
like a Deity, and he had his Sub-Gods, who un
der his fevcral Difpofitions receiv d the Homage
of Mankind in their Names 5 fuch were all the
Rabble of the Heathen Deities, from Jupiter the
Supreme, to the Lares or Houfhold Gods of every
Family j thefe, I fay, like Refidents, received the
Proflrations^ but the Homage was all Satan s ; the
Devil had the Subftance of it al!5 which was the
Idolatry, During
204 The Modern HISTORY
During this Adminiftration of Hell, there was
Ie6 Witchcraft, lefs true literal Magick than there
has been fince $ there was indeed no need of it,
the DEVIL did not ftoop to the Mechanifm of
his more modern Operations, but rul d as a Deity,
and receiv d the Vows and the Bows of his Subjects
in more State, and with more Solemnity 5 whereas
fince that, he is content to employ more Agents
and take more Pains himfelf too 3 now he runs up
and down Hackney in the World, more like a
Drudge than a Prince, and much more trran he
did then.
Hence all thofe Things we call
Apparitions and
Vifions of Ghofls, Familiar-Spirits and Dealings
with the Devil, of which there is fo great a Va
riety in the World at this Time, were not fo much
known among the People, in thofe firft
Ages of
the Devil s
Kingdom 5 in a Word, the Devil feems
to be put to his Shifts, and to fly to Art and
Stratagem for the carrying on his Affairs, much
inorc now than he did then.
One Reafon for this may be, that he has been
more difcover d and exposed in thefe Ages, than
he was before $ then he could appear in the World
in his own proper Shapes, and yet not be known j
when the Sons of GOD appeared at the divine
Summons, Satan came along with them 5 but now
he has plaid fo many fcurvy Tricks upon Men, and
they know him fo well, that he is
oblig d to play
quire out of fight and act in difguife $ Mankind
will allow nothing of his doing, and hear no
thing of his faying, in his own Namej and if you
propofe any Thing to be done, and it be but faid
the Devil is to help in the doing it, or if you fay
of any Man he deals with the Devil, or the Devil
has a Hand in it, every Body flies him and fhuns
as themoft frightful Thing in the World.
Nay,
of the D E V I L; 205
Nay, if any Thing ftrange and improbable be
done or related to be done, we prefendy fay the
Devil was at the doing it : Thus the great Ditch
at Newmarket Heatb^ is call d the Devil s Ditch $
fo the Devil built Cropland Abby, and the Whif-
pering-Place in Gloucefter Cathedral j nay, the
Cave at Caftkton^ only becaufe there s no getting
to the farther End of it, is call d the Devil s A
and the like: The poor People of Wiltjhire^ when
you ask them how the great Stones at Stonehengc
were brought thither ?
they ll all tell you theZte-
v/7 brought them : If any Mifchief extraordinary
befalls us, we prefently fay the Devil was in it,
and the Devil would have it fo 5 in a Word, the
Devil has got an ill Name among us, and fo he
is fain to act more in fenebris^ more incog, than
he ufed to do, play out of fight himfelf, and work
by the Sap, as the Engineers call it, and not open
ly and avowedly in his own Name and Perfon, as
formerly, tho perhaps not with lefs Succefs than
he did before 3 and this leads me to enquire more
narrowly into the manner of the Devil s Manage
ment of his Affairs fince the Chriftian Religion
began to fpread in the World, which manifeftly
differs from his Conduct in more antient Times 5
in which if wcdifcover fome of the moftconfum-
mate Fool s
Policy, the mofl profound fimple
Craft, and the moft fubtle ihallow Management
of Things that can by our weak Underftandings
be conceiv d, we muft only refolve it into this,
that in fhort it is the DEVIL.
CHAP
The Modern HISTORY
CHAP. II.
Of Hellas it is reprefented to us, and how
the Devil is to be underftood, as being per-
fonally in Hell, when at the fame Time
we find him at Liberty ranging over the
World.
IT
is true, as that learn d and pleafant Author, the
inimitable Dr. Brown fays, the Devil is his own
Hell y one of the moft conftituting Parts of his In
felicity is, that he cannot ac~b
upon Mankind brevi
Manu^ by his own inherent Power, as well as
Rage $
that he cannot unhinge this Creation, which, as I
have obfertfdin its Place, he had the uttnoft Averfi-
on to from its
Beginning, as it was a flated Defign
in the Creator to fupply his Place in Heaven with
a new Species of Beings calPd Man, and fill the
Vacancies occafion d by his Degeneracy and Re
bellion.
This fill d him with Rage inexpreffible, and
horrible Refolutions of Revenge, and the Impof-
iibility of executing thofe Refolutions torments
him with Defpair &amp;gt;
this added to what he was
before, makes him a compleat Devil^ with a Hell
in his own Breaft, and a Fire unquenchable burn
ing about his Heart.
I might enlarge here, and very much to the
Purpofe, in defcribing fpherically and mathemati
cally that exquifite Quality call d a devilijh Spi-
rit) in which it would naturally occur to give you
a whole Chapter upon the glorious Articles of
Malice and Envy, and efpecially upon that lufcious,
delightful, triumphant Paffion call d REVENGE*
how natural to Man, nay even to both Sexes ^
how pleafant in the very Contemplation, tho
there
&fthe DEVIL: 207
there be not juft at that Time a Power of Exe
cution 3 how palatable it is in it (elf, and how
well it relifties when difh d up with its
proper
Sauces, fuch as Plot, Contrivance, Scheme, and
Confederacy, all
leading on to Execution: How
k poflefles a human Soul in all the moft fenfible
Parts j how it empowers Mankind to fin in I-
magination, as effectually to all future Intents
and Purpofes (Damnation) as if he had finned
actually : How fafe a Practice it is
too, as to Pu-
nifhment in this Life, namely, that it
empowers
us to cut Throats clear of the Gallows, to (lan
der Virtue, reproach Innocence, wound Honour
and rtab Reputation &amp;gt;
and in a Word, to do all
the wicked Things in the World, out of the
Reach of the Law.
It would alfo require fome few Words to de-
fcribe the fecret Operations of thofe nice Quali
ties when they reach the human Soul j how ef
fectually they form a Hell within us, and how
imperceptibly they affimilate and transform us in
to Devils, meer human Devils, as really Devils as
Satan himfelf, or any of his Angels ; and that there
fore tis not fo much out of the Way, as fome
imagine, to fay, fuch a Man is an incarnate Devil j
for as Crime made Satan a Devil^ who was before
a bright immortal Seraph, or Angel ofLight 5 how
much more eafily may the fame Crime make the
fame DEVIL, tho every Way meaner and more
contemptible, of a Man or a Woman either? But
this is too grave a Subject for me at this Time.
The Devil being thus, I fay, fir d with Rage
and Envy, in coniequence of his Jealoufy upon
the Creation of Man, his Torment is encreafed
to the higheft by the Limitation of his Power,
and his being forbid to act againft Mankind by
Force of Arms &amp;gt;
this is, I fay, part of his /&//,
\vhich? as above, is within him, and which he
carries
20S The Modern HI S TORY
carries with him wherever he goes j nor is it fo
difficult to conceive of He!/9 or of the Z&amp;gt;m7,
either under this juft Defcription, as it is
by all
the ufual Notions that we are taught to enter
tain of them, by (the old Women) our Inftruc-
tors &amp;gt;
for every Man may, by taking but a com
mon View of himfelf, and making a juft Scrutiny
into his own Paffions, on fome of their particular
Excurfions, fee a /&// within himfelf, and himfelf a
meer Devil as long as the Inflammation lafts &amp;gt;
and
that as really, and to all Intents and Purpofes, as if
he had the Angel (Satan) before his Face, in his Lo
cality and Perfonality ; that is to fay, all Devil
and Monfter in his Perfon, and an immaterial but
intenfe Fire flaming about and from within him,
at all the Pores of his Body.
The Notions we receive of the Devil, as a Per&quot;
fon being in Hell as a Place^ are infinitely abfurd
and ridiculous j the firft we are certain is not true
in Fact, becaufe he has a certain Liberty, (however
limited that is not to the Purpofe) is
daily vifible,
and to be trac d in his feveral Attacks upon Man
kind, and has been fo ever fince his firit
Appear
ance in Paradife 3 as to his corporal Viiibility
that is not the prefent Queftion neither j tis
enough that we can hunt him by the Foot, that
we can follow him as Hounds do a Fox upon a
hot Scent : We can fee him as plainly by the Ef
fect, by the Mifchief he does, and more by the
Mifchief he puts us upon doing, ffay, as plainly,
as if we faw him by the Eye.
It is not to be doubted but the Devil can fee us
when and where we cannot fee him : and as he
has a Perfonality, tho it be fpirituous, he and his
Angels too may be reafonably fuppofed to inhabit
the World of Spirits, and to have free Accefs from
thence to the Regions of Life, and to pafs and
repafs in the Air, as really, tho not perceptible to
us.
&f tke DEVI L. 209
us, as the Spirits of Men do after their releafe
from the Body, pafs to the Place (wherever that
is)
which is
appointed for them.
If the Devil was confin d to a Place (Hell) as a
Prifon, he could then have no Buiinefs here 3 and
if we pretend to defcribe /&//, as not a Prifon,
but that the Devil has Liberty to be there, or not
be there as he pleafed, then he would certainly
never be there, or Hell is not fuch a Place as we
are taught to underfland it to be.
Indeed according to forne, Hell fhotild be a
Place of Fire and Torment to the Souls that are
call into it, but not to the Devils themfelves &amp;gt;
who we make little more or leis than keepers and
Turnkeys to Hell, as a Goal 3 that they are
fent about to bring Souls thither, lock them in
when they come, and then away upon the Scent
to fetch more : That one Sort of Devils are made
to live in the World among Men, and to be bufy
continually debauching and deluding Mankind
bringing them as it were to the Gates of Hell;
and then another Sort are Porters and Carriers
to fetch them in.
This is, in JJjort^ little more or lefs than the old
Story of Pluto, of Cerberus^ and of Charon 3 only
that our Tale is not half fo well told, nor the
Parts of the Fable fo well laid
together.
In all thefe Notions of Hell and Devil^ the Tor- -
ments of the firft, and the Agency of the laft
Tormenting, we meet with not one Word of
the main and perhaps only Accent of Horror,
which belongs to us to judge of about Hell, I
mean the Abfence of Heaven 3 Expulfion, and
Exclusion from the Prefence and Face of the
chief Ultimate, the only eternal and fufficient
Good 3 and this lofs fuftain d by a fordid Neglect
of our Concern in that excellent Part, in ex
change for the molt contemptible and juftly
con-
P demn d
aio The Modern HISTORY
demn d Trifles, and all this eternal and irreco
verable : Thefe People tell us nothing of the eter
nal Reproaches of Confciencc, the Horror of Def-
peration, and the Anguifh of a Mind hopelefs
of ever feeing the Glory, which alone conftitutes
Heaven, and which makes all other Places dread
ful, and even Darknefs it felf.
And this brings me directly to the Point in
Hand, (viz.) the State ofthat Hell which we ought
to have in view when we tpcak of the Devil as
in Hell : This is the very Hell, which is the Tor
ment of the Devil; in ftiort, the Devil is in HELL,
and HELL is in the Devil &amp;gt;
he is filPd with this
unquenchable Fire, he is
expePd the Place of
Glory, banifli d from the Regions of Light,
Abfence from the Life of all Beatitude is his
Curfe, Defpair is the reigning Paflion in his Mind,
and all the little Condiment Parts of his Tor
ment, fuch as Rage, Envy, Malice, and Jealoufy
are confolidated in this, to make his Mifery com-
pleat, (viz.) the Duration of it all, the Eternity of
his Condition &amp;gt;
that he is without Hope, with
out Redemption, without Recovery.
If any thing can inflame this Hell and make it
hotter, tis this only, and this does add an inex-
prcilible
Horror to the Devil himfelfj namely^ the
feeing Man (the only Creature he hates) placed
in a State of Recovery, a glorious Eftablimment
of Redemption form d for him in Heaven, and the
Scheme of it
perfected on Earth 3 by which this
Man^ tho even the Devil by his Art may have de
luded him, and drawn him into Crime, is
yet in a
State of Recovery, which the Devil is not $ and
that it is not in his (Satan s)
Power to prevent it :
Now take the Devil as he is in his own Nature
Angelic, a bright immortal Seraph, Heaven-born,
and having tafled the eternal Beatitude, which
thefe are appointed to enjoy j the Lofs of that
4 State
of the D E V I L. 21 r
State to himfelf, the PofTeffion of it
granted to his
Rival tho wicked like and as himfelf3 I fay, cake
the Devil as he is, having a quick Senfe of his own
Perdition, and a flinging Sight of his Rival s Fe
licity, tis Hell enough^ and more than enough,
even for an Angel to fupport j nothing we can
conceive can be worfe.
As to any other Fire than this, fuch and fo im
materially intenfe as to Torment a Spirit, which
is it felf Fire alfo 3 I will not fay it cannot be,
becaufe to Infinite every Thing is
poffible, but
1 mufl fay, I cannot conceive rightly of it.
I will not enter here into the Wifdorn or Rea-
fonablenefs of rcprefcnting the Torments of Hell
to be Fire, and that Fire to be a Commixture of
Flame and Sulphur \ it has pleafed God to let
the Horror of thofe eternal Agonies about a loft
Heaven, be laid before us by thofe Similitudes or
Allegories, which are moft moving to our Senfes and
to our Under(land ings ; nor will I
difpute the PofTi-
bility 3 much lefs wr
ili I doubt but that there is to be
a Confummation of Mifery to all the Objects of
Mifery when the Devil s
Kingdom in this World
ending with the World it felf, that Liberty he
has now may be farther abridged 3 when he may be
return d to the fame State he was in between the
Time of his Fall and the Creation of the World &amp;gt;
with perhaps fome additional Vengeance on him,
fuch as at prefent we cannot defcribe, for all that
Treafon and thofe high Crimes and Mifdemeanours
which he has been guilty of here, in his Convcr-

As his Infelicity will be then confummated and

a confiderable Addition from thofe Words in their

Angels; for as the Abfcnce of the fupreme Good
is a compleat Hell, fo the hated Company of the
Deceiver, who was the -great Caufe of his Ruine,
muil be a Subject of additional Horror, and he will
be always faying, as a Scots Gentleman, who died
of his Exceflcs, faid to the famous Dr. P ,
who came to fee him on his Death-bed, but had
been too much his Companion in his Life,

I would not treat the very Subject it felf with
any Indecency, nor do I think my Opinion of
that Hell) which I fay confifts in the Abfence of
him, in whom is Heaven, one Jot le(s folemn than
theirs who believe it all Fire and Brimftone; but I
muit own, that to me nothing can be more ridi
culous than the Notions that we entertain and
11 our Heads with about Hell^ and about the De-
2/Ts being there tormenting of Souls, broiling
them upon Gridirons, hanging them up upon
Hooks, carrying them upon their Backs, and the
like, with the feveral Pictures of /&//, repre-
lented by a great Mouth with horrible Teeth, gap
ing like a Cave on the Sides of a Mountain j fup-
pofe that appropriated to Satan in the Peak^ which
indeed is not much unlike it, with a Stream of
Fire coming out of ir, as there is of Water,
and {mailer Devils going and coming continually
in and out, to fetch and carry Souls the Lord
knows whither, and for the Lord knows what.
Thcfe Things, however intended for Terror,
are indeed fo ridiculous, that the Devil himfelf, to
be fure, mocks at them, and a Man of Senfe can
hardly refrain doing the like, only I avoid it, be-
c;aufe I would not give offence to weaker Heads.
However,
of the D E V IL. 213
However, I muft not Compliment the Brains
of other Men, at the Expence of my own, or
talk Nonfenfe becaufe they can underfland no
other j I think all thefe Notions and Reprcfenta-
tions of Hell and of the Devil, to be as prophane
as they are ridiculous, and I ought no more to
talk prophanely than merrily of them.
Let us learn to talk of thefe Things then, as
we fhould do &amp;gt;
and as we really cannot deferibc
them to our Reafon and Understanding, why
Should we defcribe them to our Senfes &amp;gt;
we had,
I think, much better not defcribe them at all, that
is to fay, not attempt it : The blefTed Apoftle St.
Paul was, as he faid hirnfelf, carried up, or caught
up into the third Heaven, yet when he came
down again, he could neither tell what he heard
or defcribe what he was $ all he could lay of it
was, that what he heard was inuticralle, and
what he faw was inconceivable.
It is the fame thing as to the State of the
Devil in thofe Regions which he now potteries,
and where he now more particularly inhabits &amp;gt;
my
prefent Bufinefs then is not to enter into thofe
frave
Things fo as to make them ridiculous, as
think molt People do that talk of them 5 but
as the Devil, let his Refidence be where it will,
has evidently free Leave to come and go, not
into this World only 3 ( I mean, the Region of our
jftmofphere,) but for ought we know, to all the
other inhabited Worlds which God has made,
where-ever they are, and by whatfoever Names
they are or may be known or diftinguiflied j for
if he is not confined in one Place, we have no
Reafon to believe he is excluded from any Place,
Heaven only excepted, from whence he was ex-
peird for his Treafon and Rebellion.
His Liberty then being thus afcertain d, three
Things fecm to be material for us to give an Ao
P 3 count
The Modern HISTORY
count of, in order to form this Part of his Hit
tory.
i . What his Bufinefs is on this Globe of Earth
which \ve vulgarly call the World, how
he acts among us, what Affairs Mankind and
he have together, and how far his Conduct
here relates to Us, and Ours is, or may be
influenced by him.
z. Where his Principal Refidence is, and whe
ther he has not a particular Empire of his
own, to which he retreats upon proper
Occafions &amp;gt;
where he entertains his Friends
when they come under his particular Admi-
niilration 3 and where, when he gets any
Victory over his Enemies, he carries his Pri-
foners of War.
5.
What may probably be the great Bufinefs
this black Emperor has at prefent upon his
Hands, either in this World or out of it,
and by what Agents he works.
As thefe Things may perhaps runpromifcuoufly
thro the Courfe of this whole Work, and fre
quently be touch d at under other Branches of
the Devil s Hiftory, fo I do not propofe them as
Heads of Chapters or Particular Sections, for the
.Order of Difcourfe to be handled apart ; for (by
the way) as Satan s
Actings have not been the
moft regular Things in the World, fo in our
Difcourfe about him, it muft not be expected that
we can always tie our felves down to Order and
Regularity, either as to Time, or Place, or Per-
fons , for Satan being hie &? ubique^ a loofe un-
govern d Fellow, we muft be content to trace
him where we can find him.
It is true, in the foregoing Chapter, I fhewM
you theDsvu- enued into the Herd Eeelefiaftick,
an&amp;lt;3
of the DEVIL, 215
and gave you fome Account of the firft fuccefsful
Step he took with Mankind fince the Chriftian
Epocha j how having fecretly managed both
Temporal and Spiritual Power apart, and by
themfelves, he now united them in Point of Ma
nagement, and brought the Church Usurpation
and the Army s
Ufurpation together \ the Pope to
blefs the General in depofing and murthering his
Mailer the Emperor j and the General to recog-
nife the Pope in dethroning his Mailer Chriit
Jefus.
From this time forward you are to allow the
Devil a myftical Empire in this World 5 not an
Ac~bion of Moment done without him, not a
Trcafon but he has a Hand in it, not a Tyrant
but he prompts him, not a Government but he
has a in it j not a Fool but he tickles him,
not a Knave but he guides him ; he has a Finger
in every Fraud, a Key to every Cabinet, from the
Divan at Conftantinople, to the Miffiffipi in France^
and to the South-Sea Cheats at &amp;gt;
from
the firft Attack upon the Chriftian World, in the
Perfon of the RomiJJj Antichriil, down to the
Bull Unigenitus j and from the Mixture of St. Pe
ter and Confucius in China,
to the Holy Office
in Spain *,
and down to the Emlins and Dodwdls
of the current Age.
How he has managed, and does manage, and
how in all
Probability he will manage till his
Kingdom fhall come to a Period, and how at
laft he will probably be managed himfelf, En

CHAP. III.
Of the Manner of SatanV atiing and carry-
ing on his Affairs in this World, andpar
ticularly of his ordinary Workings in the
dark, by Pofleffion and Agitation.
THE
DEVIL being thus reduc d to ab upon
Mankind by Stratagem only, it remains to
enquire how he performs., and which way he di
rects his Attacks &amp;gt;
the Faculties of Man are a
kind of a Garrifon in a ilrong Caftle, which as
they defend it on the one hand under the Command
of the reafoning Power of Man s Soul, fo they
are prefcribed on the other hand, and can t fally
out without Leave j for the Governor of a Fort
does not permit his Soldiers to hold any Corre-
fpondence with the Enemy, without fpecial
Or
der and Direction. Now the great Enquiry be
fore us is. How comes the DEVIL to a Parley
with us ? how does he converfe with our Senfes,
arid with the Underftanding ? How does he reach
us, which way does he come at the Affections,
and which way does he move the Pailions ? Tis
a little difficult to difcover this treafonable Corre-
fpondence, and that Difficulty is indeed the Devil s
Advantage, and, for ought I fee, the chief Ad
vantage he has over Mankind.
It is alio a great Enquiry here, whether the Devil
knows our Thoughts or no? If I
may give my
Opinion, I am with the negative &amp;gt;
I deny that he
knows any thing of our Thoughts, except of
thofe
Thoughts which he puts us upon thinking,
for I will not doubt but he has the Art to injecl:
Thoughts, and to revive dormant Thoughts in us :
Ic is not fo wild a Scheme as fome take it to be,
2. that
of the DEVIL. 217
that Mr. Milton lays down, to reprefent the Devil
injecting corrupt Defires and wandring Thoughts
into the Head of Eve^ by Dreams, and that he
brought her to Dream whatever he put into her
Thoughts, by whifpering to her vocally when
fhe was afleep 5 and to this End, he imagines the
DEVIL laying himfelf clofe to her Ear, in the
Shape of a Toad, when fhe was fall
afleep &amp;gt;
I
fay, this is not fo wild a Scheme, feeing even
now, if
you can whifper any thing clole to the
Ear of a Perfon in a deep Sleep, fo as to fpeak
distinctly to the Perfon, and yet not awaken him,
as has been frequently tried, the Perfon fleeping
{hall dream diftinctly of what you fay to him*
nay, fliall dream the very Words you fay.
We have then no more to ask, but how the
DEVIL can convey himfelf to the Ear of a fleep-
ing Perfon, and it.is
granted then that he may have
Power to make us dream what he pleafes : But
this is not all, for if he can fo forcibly, by his
invifible Application, caufe us to dream, what he
pleafes, why can he not with the fame Facility
prompt our Thoughts, whether fleeping or
waking ? To dream, is
nothing elfe but to think
fleeping j and we have abundance of deep-headed
Gentlemen among us, who give us ample Tefii-
mony that they dream waking.
But if the DEVIL can prompt us to dream,
that is to fay, to think, yet if he does not know
our Thoughts, how then can he tell whether
the Whifper had its EfFec~b ? The anfwer is
plain,
the DEVIL, like the Angler, baits the Hook, if
the Fifh bite he lies ready to take the Advantage,
he whifpers to the Imagination, and then waits
to fee how it works &amp;gt;
as Naomi faid to Ruth^
Chap. iii.
f, 18. Sit ftill^ my Daughter, until thou,
know ho W the Matter will fall, for the Man will
wt be at reft until he have finijhed the thing. Thus
when
2U The Modern HISTORY
when the DEVIL had whifper d to Eve in her
Sleep, according to Milton^ and fuggefted Mifchief
to her Imagination, he only fat {till to fee how
the Matter would work, for he knew if it took
with her, he fhould hear more of it&amp;gt;
and then
by finding her alone the next Day, without her
ordinary Guard her Husband, he prefently con
cluded flie had fwallowed the Bait, and fo at-
tack d her afrefh.
A fmall deal of Craft, and lefs by far than we
have reafon to believe the Devil is Mailer of, will
ferve to difcover whether fuch and fuch Thoughts
as he knows he has fuggefted, have taken Place
or no &amp;gt;
the Adbion of the Perfon prefently difco-
vers it, at leaft to him that lies
always upon the
Wutch, and has every Word, every Gefture, e~
very Step we take fubfequent to his Operation,
open to him j it
may therefore, for ought we
know, be a great Miilake, and what moil of us
are guilty of7 to tell our Dreams to one another
in the Morning, after we have been diflurb d with
them in the Night &amp;gt;
for if the Devil converfes
with us fo infenfibly as fome are of the Opinion
he does, that is to fay, if he can hear as far as
we can fee, we may be telling our Story to him
indeed, when we think we are only talking to
one another.
This brings me moil naturally to the impor
tant Enquiry, whether the Devil can walk about
the World invidbly or no? The Truth is, this
is no queilion to me} for as I have taken away
his Vifibility already, and have denied him all
Prefcience of Futurity too, and have prov d he
cannot know our Thoughts, nor put any Force
upon Perfons or Aftions, if we ihould take away
his Invifibility too, we ihould undmil him quite,
to all Intents and Purpofes, as to any Mifchief
he could do j nay, it would baniflihim the World,
and
of the DEVIL:
and he might e en go and feek his Fortune fome
where elfe , for if he could neither be vifible or
invifible, neither act in publick or in private, he
could neither have Bufinefs or Being in this
Sphere, nor could we be any way concerned with
him.
The Devil therefore mofl certainly has a Power
and Liberty of moving about in this World, af
terfome manner or another ; this is
verify d as well
by way of Allegory, as by way of Hiftory, in
the Scripture it felf 5 and as the firft
ftrongly
fuggefts and fuppofes it to be fo, the laft
pofi-
tively aflerts it-, and, not to croud this Work
with Quotations from a Book which we have
not much to do with in the Devil s
Story, at
leaft not much to his Satisfaction, I only hint his
perfonal Appearance to our Saviour in the Wil-
derneis, where it is faid, the Devil taketh him up
to an exceeding high Mountain , and in another
Place, the Devil departed from him. What Shape
or Figure he appeared in, we do not find men
tioned, but I cannot doubt his
appearing to him
there, any more than I can his talking to our Sa
viour in the Mouths, and with the Voices of the
feveral Perfons who were under the terrible Af
fliction of an a&ual PofTeflion.
Thefe Things leave us no room to doubt of
what is advanced above, namely, that he, (the
Devil) has a certain Refidence, or Liberty of
redding in, and moving about upon the Surface of
this Earth, as well as in the Compals of the At-
mofphere, vulgarly call d the Air^ in fome manner
or other: That is the general.
It remains to enquire into the manner, which I
refolve into two Kinds
.
Ordinary, which I fuppofe to be his invi-
fible Motions as a Spirit 3 under which Con-
iideration
izo The Modern HISTORY
fideration I fuppofe him to have an uncort-
jfin d, unlimited, unreftrain d Liberty, as to
the manner of a6Hng &amp;gt;
and this either in
Perfons, by PofMion&amp;gt; or in Things, by A-
gitation.
z. Extraordinary &amp;gt;
which I underfbnd to be
his Appearances in borrowed Shapes and Bo
dies, or Shadows rather of Bodies 5 afluming
Speech, Figure, Pofture, and fcveral Pow
ers, of which we can give little or no Ac
count 5 in which extraordinary manner of
Appearances, he is either limited by a fupe-
rior Power, or limits himfelf politically, as
being not the Way moil for his Intcreit or
Purpofe, to act in his Bufinefs, which is
more effectually done in his State of Obfcu-
rity.
Hence we muft fuppofe the Devil has it
very
much in his own Choice, whether to act in one Ca
pacity,
or in the other, or in both} that is to
lay, of appearing, and not appearing, as he finds
for his Purpofe : In this State of Invifibility, and
under the Operation ofthefe Powers and Liberties,
lie performs all his Functions and Offices, as De-
y/7, as Prince of Darknefs, as God of this World,
as Tempter, Accuier, Deceiver, and all whatfoever
other Names of Office, or Titles of Honour he
is known by.
Now taking him in this large unlimited, or
little limited State of Action, he is well calPd,
the God of this World^ for he has very much of
the Attribute of Omniprefence, and may be faid,
either by himfslf or his Agents,
to be every where,
And fee every thing j that is to fay, every thing
that is vifible -,
for I cannot allow him any Share
of Qmnifrisncz a: all.
That
of the DEVIL, 221
That he ranges about every where, is with us9
fcnd fometimes in us, fees when he is not feen,
hears when he is not heard, comes in without
Leave, and goes out without Noife, is neither
to be fhut in or {hut out, that when he runs from
us we can t catch him, and when he runs after us
we can t
efcape him, is feen when he is not known,
and is known when he is not feen j all thefe
things, and more, we have Knowledge enough
about to convince us of the Truth of them} fo that,
as I have faid above, he is
certainly walking to
and fro thro the Earth, &c. after fome manner
or otherj
and in fome Figure or other, vifible or
invifiblc, as he finds Occanon. Now in order
to make our Hiflory of him complete, the next
Queftion before us is, how, and in what man
ner he afts with Mankind ? how his Kingdom is
carried on, and by what Methods he does his Bu-
fmefs, for he certainly has a great deal of Bufinefs
to do 5 he is not an idle Spectator, nor is he walk
ing about incognito,and cloth d inMift and Dark-
nefs, purely in Kindnefs to us, that we fhould
not be frighted at him 3 but tis in Policy, that
he may ab undifcover d, that he may fee and not
be feen, may play his Game in the dark, and not
be detefted in his Roguery ; that he may prompt
Mifchief, raife
Tempefts, blow up Coals, kindle
Strife, embroil Nations, ufe Inftruments, and not
be known to have his Hand in any thing, when
at the fame time he really has a Hand in every
thing.
Some are of Opinion, and I among the refi^
that if the Devil was perfonally and vifibly pre-
fent among us, and we converfed with him Face
to Face, we fhould be fo familiar with him in a
little time, that his ugly Figure would not affecl
us at all, that his- Terrors would not fright us,
or that we fhould any more trouble our felves
about
222 The Modern HISTORY
about him, than we did with the laft great Co
met in 1678. which appear d fo long and fo con-
ftantly without any particular known Event, that
at laft we took no more Notice of it than of the
other ordinary Stars which had appear d before
we or our Anceftors were born.
Nor indeed fhould we have much Reafon to be
frighted at him, or atleaft none of thofe filly Things
could be faid of him which we now amufe our
felves about, and by which we fet him up like a
Scare-Crow to fright Children and old Women,
to fill
up old Stories, make Songs and Ballads,
and in a Word, carry on the low priz d Buf
foonery ofthe common People &amp;gt;
we fhould either
fee him in his Angelic Form, as he was from the
Original, or if he has any Deformities entail d
upon him by the fupreme Sentence, and in Ju-
ilice to the Deformity of his Crime, they would
be of a fuperior Nature, and fitted more for our
Contempt as well as Horror, than thofe weak fan
cied Trifles contrived by our antient Devil-raifers
and Devil- makers, to feed the wayward Fancies
of old Witches and Sorcerers, who cheated the
ignorant World with a Devil of their own mak
ing, fet forth, in terrorem, with Bat s
Wings,
Horns, cloven Foot, long Tail, fork d Tongue,
and the like.
In the next Place, be his frightful Figure what it
would, and his Legions as numerous as theHoftof
Heaven, we fhould fee him ftill, as the Prince of De
vils, tho* monftrous as a Dragon, flaming as a Co
met, tall as a Mountain, yet dragging his Chain
after him equal to the utmoft of his fuppofed
Strength; always in Cuftody of his Jailors the
Angels, his Power over-power d, his
Rage cow d
and abated, or at leaft aw d and under Corre&ion,
limited and reflrain d \ in a Word, we fhould
fee him a vanquifh d Slave, his Spirit broken,
his
of the D EVIL; 22
his Malice, tho not abated, yet Hand-cuff d and
overpower d, and he not able to work any Thing
againft us by Force &amp;gt;
fo that he would be to us but
like the Lions in the Tower, encag d and lock d
up, unable to do the Hurt he wimes to do, and
that we fear, or indeed any hurt at all.
From hence tis evident, that tis not his Bu-
finefs to be public, or to walk up and down in
the World vifibly, and in his own Shape &amp;gt;
his
Affairs require a quite different Management, as
might be made apparent from the Nature of
Things, and the Manner of our Actings, as Men,
cither with our felves or to one another.
Nor could he be ferviceable in his Generation,
as a public Perfon as now he is, or anfwer the
End of his Party who employ him, and who, if
he was to do their Bufinefs in public, as he does
in private, would not be able to employ him
at ail.
As in our modern Meetings for the Propagation
of Impudence and other Virtues, there would be
no Entertainment and no Improvement for the
Good of the Age, if the People did not all
ap
pear in Mafque, and conceal d from the com
mon Observation j fo neither could Satan (from
whofe Management tbofe more happy AfTem-
blies are taken as Copies of a glorious Original)
perform the ufual and neceflary Bu finefs of his
ProfefSon, if he did not appear wholly in Covert
and under needful Difguifesy how, but for the
Convenience of his Habit, could he caft himfelf
into fo many Shapes, aft on fo many different
Scenes, and turn fo many Wheels of State in the
World, as he has done ? as/a meer profeiVd Zte-
vil he could do nothing.
Had he been oblig d always to aft the meer
Devil in his own Clothes, and with his own Shape,
appearing uppermoft in ail Cafes and Places, he
could
224- The Modern HISTORY
could never have preach d in fo many Pulpits^
prefided in fo many Councils, voted in fo many
Committees, fat in fo many Courts, and influenced
fo many Parties and Factions in Church and State,
as we have Reafon to believe he has done in our
Nation, and in our Memories too, as well as in
other Nations and in more antient Times. The
Share Satan has had in all the weighty Confufions
of the Times, ever fince the firft
Ages of Chrifti-
anity in the World, has been carried on with fo
much Secrefy, and fo much with an Air of Ca*
bal and Intrigue, that nothing can have been
manag d more fubtilly and clofcly, and in the fame
Manner has he a&ed in our Times, in order to
conceal his Intereft, and conceal the Influence he
has had in the Councils of the World.
Had it been potllble for him to have raifed the
Flames of Rebellion and War fo often in this
Nation, as he certainly has done ? Could he have
agitated the Parties on both Sides, and inflam d
the Spirits
of three Nations, if he had appeared in
his own Dreis, a meer naked DEVIL? It is not the
Devil as a Devil^ that does the Mifchief, but the
Devil in Mafquerade, Satan in full
Difguife, and act
ing at the Head of civil Confufionand Diitra6Hon.
if Hiitory may be credited, the French Court at
the Time of our old Confufions was made the Scene
of Satan s Politicks, and prompted both Parties
in England wA in Scotland alfo to quarrel, and how
was it done ? Will any Man offer to fcandalize the
Devil fo much as to fay, or fo much as to fuggeft
that Satan had no Hand in it all? Did not the Devil^
by the Agency of Cardinal Richlieu^ fend 400000
Crowns at one TimeJ and 600000 at another, to
the Scots, to raife an Army and march boldly into
England? and did not the fame Devil, at the fame
time, by other Agents, remit 800000 Crowns to
the other Party, in order to raife an Army to fall
upon
tftk DEVIL. 225
tip
an the Scots ? nay, did not the Devil with the
fame Subtilty fend down the ArchbifhopJs Order
to impofe the Service-Book upon the People in
Scotland^ and at the fame Time raife a Mob a-
gainft it,
in the great Church (at St. Giles s)?
Nay, did not he actually, in the Perfon of an old
Woman (his favourite Inftrument) throw the
three-leg d Stool at the Service-Book, and ani
mate the zealous People to take up Arms for Re
ligion, and turn Rebels for God Sake?
All thefe happy and fuccefsful Undertakings,
tho tis no more to be doubted they were done
by the Agency of Satan, and in a very furpriz-
ing Manner too, yet were all done in fecret, by
what I Call Pofleflion and Injection, and by the
Agency and Contrivance of fuch Internments, or
by the Devil in the Difguife of fuch Servants as
he found out fitted to be employ d in his Work,
and who he took a more effectual Care in con
cealing of.
But we {hall have Occafion to touch all this Part
over again, when we come to difcourfe of the par
ticular Habits and Difguifes which the Devil has
made ufe of, all
along in the World, the better
to cover his Actions, and to conceal his being
concern d in them.
In the mean Time the Cunning or Artifice the
Devil makes ufe of in all thefe Things is in it felf
Very considerable 5 tis an old Practice of hisufing,
and he has gone on in diverfe Meafures, for the
better concealing himfelf in it ; which Meafures,
tho he varies fometimes, as his extraordinary Af
fairs
require, yet they are in all
Ages much the
fame, and have the fame Tendency -&amp;gt;
namely, that
he may get all his Bufinefs carried on by the In-
flrumentality of Fools -,
that he may make Man
kind Agents in their own Deftruftion, and thac
he may have all his Work done in fuch a Manner
Q_ as
^26 The Modern HISTORY
as that he may fccm to have no Hand in it ; nay he
contrives fo well, that the very Name Devil is
put
upon his oppofite Party, and the Scandal of the
black Agent lies all
upon them.
In order then to look a little into his Conduit,
let us enquire into the common Miftakes about
him, fee what Ufe is made of them to his Ad
vantage, and how far Mankind is
impofed upon
in thofe Particulars, and to what Purpofe.

are fent to do.
Nor is it
ftrange at all, that the Devil fhould
have fuch a numberlefs Train of Deputy Devils
to act under him &amp;gt;
for it muft be acknowledged he
has a great deal of Bufinefs upon his Hands, a
vaft deal of Work to do, abundance of public
Affairs under his Direftion, and an infinite Va
riety of particular Cafes always before him $ for
Example.
How many Governments in the World are
wholly in his Adminiftration ? how many Divans
and great Councils under his Direftion ?
nay, I
believe, twould be hard to prove that there is or
has been one Council of State in the World for
many hundred Years paft, down to the Year 171 j,
(we don t
pretend to come nearer home) where
the Devilry himfelf, or his Agents in one Shape
or another, has not fat as a Member, if not talced
the Chair. i And
228 The Modern HISTORY
And tho forne learn d Authors may difpuce
this Point with me, by giving fome Examples
where the Councils of Princes have been afced
by a better Hand, and where Things have been
carried againft Satan s Intereft, and even to his
great Mortification, it amounts to no more than
this ; namely, that in fuch Cafes the Devil has been
out-voted 5 but it does not argue but he might
have been prefent there, and have pufh d his In-
tereft as far as he could, only that he had not the
Succefs he expedtedj for I don t
pretend to fay
that he has never been difappointed 5 but thole
Examples are fo rare, and of fo fmall Significa
tion, that when I come to the Particulars, as I
ihall do in the Sequel of this Hi(lory, you will
find them hardly worth naming &amp;gt;
and that, take it
one Time with another, the Devil has met with
fuch a Series of Succefs in all his Affairs, and has fo
feldom been baulk d ; and where he has met
with a little Check in his Politicks, has notwith-
ftanding, fo foon and fo
eafily
recovered himfelf,
regained his loft Ground, or replaced himfelf in
another Country when he has been fupplanted in
one, that his Empire is far from being leflen d in
the World, for the laft thoufand Years of the
Chriftian Eftablifhment.
Suppofe we take an Obfervation from the Be
ginning of Lutheri
or from the Year 1420. and
call the Reformation a Blow to the Devil s
King
dom, which before that was come to fuch a
Height in Chriflendom, that tis a Queftion not
yet thorowly decided, whether that Medley of
Superftition and horrible Herefies, that Mafs of
Enthufiam and Idols call d the Catholick Hierar
chy, was a Church of God or a Church of the
Devil; whether it was an AfTembly of Saints or
a
Synagogue of Satan : I fay, take that Time to
be the Epocha of Satan s Declenilon and of Lu-
4 cifer s
of the D E V I L; 229
cifer s
fating from Heaven, that is, from the Top
of his terreftrial Glory, yet whether he did not
gain in the Defection of the Greek Church about
that Time and fince, as much as he loft in the
Reformation of the Roman, is what Authors are
not yet agreed about, not reckoning what he has
regain d fince of the Ground which he had loft
even by the Reformation, (viz.) the Countries of
the Duke of Savoy s Dominion, where the Re
formation is almoft eaten out by Perfccution $ the
whole Faltoline and (bme adjacent Countries 3 the
whole Kingdom of Poland and almoft all
Hungary 5
for fince the laft War the Reformation, as it were,
lies
gafping for Breath, and expiring in that Coun
try, alfo feveral large Provinces in Germany, as
Auftria^ Carinthia, and the whole Kingdom of
Bohemia, where the Reformation once powerful
ly planted, receiv d its Death s Wound at the
Battle of Prague, Ann. 1617, and languifh d but
a very little while, died and was buried, and good
King POPERY reign d in its ftead.
To thefe Countries thus regain d to Satan s
infernal Empire, let us add his modern Conquefts
and the Encroachments he has made upon the
Reformation in the prefent Age, which are, how
ever light we make of them, very considerable (viz.)
the Electorate ofthe Rhine and the Palatinate, the
one fallen to the Houfe of Bavaria, and the other
to that ofNeuburgh, both Popifh $ the Dutchy of
Deux Fonts fallen juft now to a popilh Branch,
the whole Electorate of Saxony fallen under the
Power of popifh Government by the Apoftacy of
their Princes, and more likely to follow the Fate
of Bohemia, whenever the diligent Devil can bring
his new Project in Poland to bear, as tis more
than probable he will do fo fome. time or other,
by the growing Zeal as well as Power of ( that;
Houfe of Bigots) the Houfe of A .
But
230 The Modern HISTORY
But to fum up the dull Story 5 we mud add in
the Roll of the //m/ s
Conquefts, the whole King
dom of France^ where we have in one Year feen,
to the immortal Glory of the Devil s Politicks,
that his Meafures have prevailed to the total
Extirpation of the Proteflant Churches without
a War &amp;gt;
and that Intereft which for zoo Years
had fupported it felf in fpight of Perfections,
Mafiacres, five civil Wars and innumerable Bat
tles and Slaughters, at lafl received its mortal
Wound from its own Champion Henry IV. and
funk into utter Oblivion, by Satan s
moftexquifite
Management under the Agency of his two prime
Minilters Cardinal RiMieu and Lewis the XIV,
whom he entirely poflefs d.
Thus far we have a melancholy View of the
Devil s new Conquefts, and the Ground he has re-
gain d upon the Reformation, in which his fe-
cret Management has been fo
exquifite, and his
Politicks fo good, that could he bring but one
Thing to pafs, which by his own former Miflake,
(for the Devil is not infallible) he has rendred im-
poffible, he would bring the Proteflant Intereft
fo near its Ruin, that Heaven would be, as It
were^ put to the Necefftty of working by Mira
cle to prevent it ; the Cafe is thus.
Antient Hiftorians tell us, and from good Au
thority, that the DEVIL finding it for his Intereft -
to bring his favourite Afoto^/ upon the Stage, and
fpread the victorious Half-Moon upon the Ruin
of the Crofs, having with great Succefs, rais d
fir ft the Saracen Empire, and then the Turkijh to
fuch a Height, as that the Name of Chriltain ieem-
cd to be extirpated in thofe two Quarters of the
World, which were then not the greateft only,
but by far the moft powerful, I mean dfia, and Afri
ca ;
having totally laid waft all thofe antient and
flourifhing Churches of Afnca^ the Labours of
St.
of the D E V I L, 231
St. Cyprian, fertullian, St. dugufline, and 670
Chriiiian Biihops and Fathers, who governed there
at once, alfo all the Churches of Smyrna,
Phila
delphia, Ephefus, Sardis, dnlioch, Laodicea, and
innumerable others in Pontus, Bithynia, and the.
Provinces of the letter Afta.
The Devil having, I fay, finiih d thefe Con-
quells fo much to his Satisfaction., began to turn
his Eyes Northward, and tho he had a confidera-
ble Intereft in the Whore of Babylon, and had
brought his Power by the Subjection of the Ro
man Hierarchy to a great Height, yet finding the
Intereft of Mahomet moil fuitable to his devilijh
Purpofes, as moil adapted to the Deftruftion of
Mankind, and laying waile the World, he refolv d
to efpoufe the growing Power of the Turk, and
bring him in upon Europe like a Deluge.
In order to this, and to make Way for an eafy
Conquefl, like a true Devil he work d under
Ground, and fap d the Foundation of the Chriiii
an Power, by (owing Difcord among the reigning
Princes of Europe 5 that fo envying one another
they might be content to (land ftill and look on
while the Turk devoured them one by one, and at
lail
might (wallow them up all.
This devilijh Policy took to his Heart s Con
tent j the Chriiiian Princes ilood ftill, flupid,
dozing, and unconcern d, till the Turk con
quered Thrace, over-run Servia, Macedonia, Bui*
garia, and all the Remains of the Grecian Empire,
and a,t lail the Imperial City of Conftantinople it
felf.
Finding this politic Method fo well anfwer his
Ends, the Devil, who always improves upon the
Succefs of his own Experiments, refolv d [from
that time to lay a Foundation for the making
thofe Divifions and Jealouiies of the Chrifti-
an Princes immortal &amp;gt;
whereas they were at
CL4 firft
232 The Modern HISTORY
firft only perfonal, and founded in private Quar
rels between the Princes refpeftively ; fuch as
Emulation of one another s Glory, Envy at the
extraordinary Valour, or other Merit of this or:
that Leader, or Revenge of fome little Affront -,
for
which notwithstanding, fo great was the Piety of
Chrittian Princes inthofe Days, that they made no
Scruple to facrifice whole Armies, yea, Nations,
to their Piques and private Quarrels, a certain Sign
whofc Management they were under.
Thefe being the Caufes by which the DEVIL
firft fow d the Seeds of Mifchief among them,
and the Succefs fo well anfwering his Defign, he
could not but wrfn to have the fame Advantage
always ready at his Hand -
y and therefore he refolv d
to order it fo, that thefe Divifions, which, how
ever ufeful to him, were only perfonal, and con-
fequently temporary, like an Annual in the Gar
den, which muft be raised anew every Seafon, might
for the future be national, and confequently dura
ble and immortal.
To this end it was neceiTary to lay the Foundati
on of eternal Feud, not in the Humours and Paf-
iions of Men only, but in the Interefts of Nations :
The Way to do this was to form and {late the Do
minion of thofe Princes, by fuch a Plan drawn in
Hell, and laid out from a Scheme truly political,
of which the Devil was chief Engineer $ that
the Divifions fhould always remain, being made
a natural Confequence of the Situation of the
Country, the Temper of their People, the Na
ture of their Commerce, the Climate, the Man-
ner of living, or fomething which ihould forever
render it
impoffible for them to unite.
This, I lay, was a Scheme truly infernal, in
which the Devil was as certainly the principal Ope
rator, to illuilrate great Things by fmall, as ever
was of the High Dutch Rebellion,or
SU
.
235
Sir John B / of the late Project, called the
South-Sea Stock. Nor did this Contrivance of
the Devil at all difhonour his Author, or the
Succefs appear unworthy of the Undertaker 3 for
we fee it not only anfwer the End, and made the
furk victorious at the fame Time, and formidable
to Europe ever after, but it works to this Day,
the Foundation of the Divifions remains in all
the feveral Nations, and that to fuch a Degree
that it is
impoffible they fhould unite.
This is what I hinted before, in which the
Devil was miftaken, and is another inftance
that he knows nothing of what s is to come* for
this very Foundation of immortal Jealoufy and
Difcord between the feveral Nations of Spain,
France, Germany, and others, which the Devil
himfelf with fo much Policy contriv d, and which
ferv d his Interefts fo long, is now the only Ob-
flruction to his Defigns, and prevents the entire
Ruin of the Reformation ; for tho the reform d
Countries are very Powerful, and fome of them,
as Great Britain and Pruffia is
particularly, more
powerful than ever $ yet it cannot be faid that the
Proteftant Interefts in general are flronger than
formerly, or fo ftrong as they were in 162,3.
under the victorious Arms of the Swede ; On
the other Hand, were it
pofTible that the Popifh
Powers, to wit, of France, Spain, Germany, Ita
ly and Poland, which are intirely Popilh, could
heartily unite their Interefts, and fhould join their
Powers to attack the Proteftants, the latter would
find it
very difficult, if not impofTible,
to de
fend themfelves.
But as fatal as fuch a Union of the Popifh
Powers would be, and as ufeful as it would be to
the Devil s Caufe at this time, not the Devil with
all his Angels are able to bring it to pafs&amp;gt; no,
with all his Craft and Cunning j he divided
them.
234 The Modern HISTORY
them, but he can t unite them 3 fo that evenjuft
as tis with Men, fo tis with Devils, they may
do in an Hour what they can t undo in an Age.
This may comfort thofe faint-hearted Chniti-
ans among us, who cry out of the Danger of a
religious War in Europe, and what terrible
Things
will happen when France, and Spain, and Ger
many, and Italy, and Poland fhall all unite 3 let this
Anfwer fatisfy them, The Devil himfelf can ne
ver make France and Spain, or France and the
Emperor unite 3 jarring Humours may be recon-
cil d, but jarring Interefts never can :
They may
unite fo as to make Peace, tbo* that can hardly
be long, but never fo as to make Conquefis toge
ther 3 they are too much afraid of one another,
for one to bear, that anyAddition ofStrength fhould
come to the other. But this is a Digreffion. We
ihall find the Devil miftaken and difapointed too
on feveral other Occafions, as we go along.
I return to Satan s Intereft in the feveral Go
vernments and Nations, by verttie of his Invifi-
bility, and which he carries on by Pofleffion 3 tis
by this
Invifibility that he prefides in all the
Councils of foreign Powers, (for we never mean
our own, that we always premife 3) and what tho
it is
alledged by the Criticks, that he does not
prefide, becaufe there is
always a Prefident 3 I
lay, if he is not in the Prefident s
Chair, yet if
he be in the Prefident himfelf, the Difference is
not much 3 and if he does not vote as a Coun-
fellor, if he votes in the Counfellor, tis much
the fame 3 and here, as it was in the Story of
Jtbab the King of Ifrael, as he was a lying Spirit
in the Mouths of all his
Prophets-
y fo we find
him a Spirit of fome particular evil Quality or
other, in all the Tranfa&ions and Tranfadors on
that Stage of Life we call the State.
Thus
tftke DEVIL. 235
Thus he was a diflembling Spirit in Char. IX.
a turbulent Spirit in Char. V. Emperors &amp;gt;
a bi-
gotted Spirit of Fire and Faggot in our Queen
Mary 5 an apoftate Spirit in Hen. IV. &amp;gt;
a cruel
Spirit in Peter of Caflik 5 a revengeful Spirit in
Ferdinand II. 5 a Phaeton in Lewis XIV. &amp;gt;
a &ir-
dan&palus in C II.
In the Great Men of the World, take them
a degree lower than the Clafs of Crown d Heads,
he has the fame fecret Influence; and hence it
comes to pafs, that the greater! Heroes, and Men of
the higheft Character for Atchievements of Glory,
either by their Virtue or Valour, however they
have been crowned with Victories, and elevated
by human Tongues, whatever the mod confum-
mate Virtues or good Qualities they have been
known by, yet they have always had fome Devil
or other in them to preferve Satan s Claim to
them uninterrupted, and prevent their Efcape out
of his Hands j thus we have been a bloody Devil
in a D^Alva j a profligate Devil in a Bucking
ham &amp;gt;
a lying, artful, or politick Devil in a Ricb-
lleu -
y a treacherous Devil in a Mazarin ; a cruel,
mercilefs Devil in a Cortez : a debauch d Devil
in an Eugene &amp;gt;
a conjuring Devil in a Luxemburg j
and a covetous Devil in a M b : In a
word, tell me the Man, I tell you the Spirit that
reign d in him.
Nor does he thus carry on his fecret Manage
ment by Pofleffion in Men of the firfl
Magnitude
only, but have you not had Evidences of it
among
our felves ? how has he been a lying Spirit in the
Mouths of our Prophets, a fa&ious Spirit in the
Heads of our Politicians, a profufe Devil in a
B s, a corrupt Devil in M , a proud
Spirit in my Lord Plaufible^ a bullying Spirit in
my Lord Bugbear^ a talkative Spirit in his Grace

Frightful 3 and fo thro a long Roll of Heroes,
\vhofe exceeding, and particular Qualifications
proclaim loudly what Handle the Devil took them
by, and how raft he held them 3 for thefe were
all Men of ancient Fame, I hope you know that.
From Men of Figure, we defcend to the Mob,
and tis there the fame thing 3 Pofleflion, like the
Plague, is Morbus Plebaei 3 not a Family but he
is a Spirit of Strife and Contention among them 5
not a Man but he has a Part in him 3 he is a
drunken Devil in one, a whoring Devil in ano
ther, a thieving Devil in a third, a lying Devil
in the fourth, and fo on, to a thoufand, and a
hundred thoufand, ad mfinitum.
Nay, even the Ladies have their Share in the
Pofleilion 3 and if they have not the Devil in
their Heads, or in their Tails, in their Faces or
their Tongues, it muft be fome poor defpicable
She-devil that Satan did not think it worth his
while to meddle with 3 and the Number of thofe
that are below his Operation, I doubt is
very
fmall. But that Part I have much more to fay to
in its Place.
From Degrees of Perfons, to Profeffions and
Employments, tis the fame 3 we find the Devil
is a true Poflure-mafter, he aflumes any Drefs,
appears in any Shape, counterfeits every Voice,
acts upon every Stage 3 here he wears a Gown,
there a long Robe 3 here he wears the Jack- Boots,
there the Small- Sword 3 is here an Enthujiaft^
there a Buffoon 3 on this Side he acts the Mounte-
lank^ on that Side the Merry-Andrew 3 nothing
comes amifs to him, from the Great Mogul^ to
the Scaramouch 3 the Devil is in them, more or
lefs, and plays his Game fo well that he makes
fure Work with em all : He knows where the
Common Foibkt lies, which is UNIVERSAL PAS
SION,
SIGN, what Handle to take hold of every Man
by, and how to cultivate his Intereft fo, as not
to fail of his End, or miHake the Means.
How then can it be deny d but that his acting
thus in tenebris^ and keeping out of the fight of
the World, is
abundantly his Intereft, and that
he could do nothing, comparatively (peaking, by
any other Method ?
What would this publick Appearance have fig-
nified ? Who would have entertain d him in his
own proper Shape and Perfon ? Even B B
himfelf, tho all the World knows him to have
a foolifh Devil m him, would not have been Fool
enough to have taken him into his Service, if he
had known him : And my Lord Simpleton alfo,
who Satan has fet
up for a cunning Fool, feems
to have it fit much better upon him now he
pafTes for a Fool of Art, than it ihould have done
if the naked DEVIL had come and challenged
him for a Fool in Nature.
Infinite Variety illuftrate the Devil s Reign
among the Sons of Men &amp;gt;
all which he manages
with admirable Dexterity, and a Slight particular
to himfelf, by the mere Advantage of his preient
conceaFd Situation, and which, had he been ob
liged to have appeared in Publick, had been all
loft, and he capable of juft nothing at all, or at
leaft of nothing more than the other ordinary Po
liticians of Wickednefs could have done without
him.
Now, Authors are much divided as to the man
ner how the Devil manages his proper Inftru-
ments for Mifchief j for Satan has a great many
Agents in the Dark, who neither have the DEVIL
in them, nor are they much acquainted with him,
and yet he ferves himfelf of them, whether of
their Folly, or of that other Frailty call d Wit,
tis all one, he makes them do his Work, when
they
23$ The Modern HISTORY
they think they are doing their own j nay, fo
cunning is he in his guiding the weak Part of
the World, that even when they think they are
ferving God, they are doing nothing lefs or more
than ferving the Devil; nay, tis fome of the
niceft Part of his Operation, to make them be
lieve they are ferving God, when they do his
Work. Thus thofe who the Scripture foretold
Should perfecute ChriuVs Church in the latter
Days, were to think they do God good Service :
Thus the Inquifition, (for Example,) it
may be,
at this time, in all the ah of Chriftian Cruelty
which they are fo famous for (if any of them are
ignorant enough not to know that they are De*
vils incarnate) they may, for ought we know, go
on for God s fake 5 torture, murther, ftai;ve to
Death, mangle and macerate, and all for God,
and God s Catholic Church &amp;gt;
and tis
certainly
the Devil s
Matter-piece to bring Mankind to
fuch a Perfection of Devilifm as that of the /-
quijition is &amp;gt;
for // the Devil bad not been in them^
could they chriften fuch a Hell-fire Judicature as
the Inquifition is, by the Name of the Holy Of
fice ? And fo in Paganifm, how could fo many
Nations among the poor Indians offer human Sa
crifices to their Idols, and murther thoufands of
Men, Women and Children, to appeale this God
of the Air, when he is
angry, if the Devil did
not ac~b in them under the Vizor of Devotion ?
But we need not go to America^ or to the In-
quifition, not to Paganifm or to Popery Cither, to
look for People that are facrificing to the Dc^il^
or that give their Peace-offerings to him, while
they are offered upon God s Altar j are not our
Churches (ay, and Mceting-houfes too, as much
as they pretend to be more fancUfied than their
Neighbours) full of Devil Worfhipers ? Where
do his Devotees gratulate one another, and con
gratulate
of the D EVIL. 239
gratulate him, more than at Church ? where,
while they hold up their Hands, and turn up their
Eyes towards Heaven, they make all their Vows
to Satan, or at lead to the fair Devils his Repre-
fentatives, which I fhall fpeak of in their Place,
Do not the Sons of God make AfHgnations
with the Daughters of Men in the very Houfe
of Worfhip ? Do they not talk to them in the
Language of the Eyes ? And what is at the Bot
tom of it, while one Eye is
upon the Prayer-
book, and the other adjufting their Drefs ? Arc
they not facrificing to Fenus and Mercury, nay,
and the very Devil they drefs at ?
Let any Man impartially furvey the Church-
Geftures, the Air, the Poitures and the Behavi
our &amp;gt;
let him keep an exact Roll, and if I do not
fhew him two Devil Worfhipers for one true
Saint, then the Word Saint muft have another
Signification than I ever yet underftood it
by.
The Church (as a Place) is the Receptacle of
the Dead, as well as the AfTembly of the Living j
what relates to thofe below, f doubt Satan, if he
woukl be fo kind, could give a better Account
of than I can j but as to the Superficies, I pre
tend to fo much Penetration as to tell you, that
there are more Speftres, more Apparitions always
there, than you that know nothing of the matter

and this is one Part of it, (viz.)\ic thruih our Vi

and the Unclean, and thus by the Corruption or
the one, poifons and debauches the other, fo that
the Slave he governs cannot account for his own
common A6tions, and is fain to be oblig d to
his Maker to accept of the Heart without the
Hands and Feet ; to take, as we vulgarly exprefs
it, the Will for the Deed^ and if Heaven was not
fo good to come into that half in half Service,
I don t fee but the Devil would carry away all
his Servants : Here indeed I fhould enter into a
long Detail of involuntary Wickednefs, which
in fhort, is neither more or lefs than the Devil in
every Body, ay, in every one of you, (our Go
vernors excepted) take it&quot; as you pleafe.
What is our Language when we look back

you, as to this Story of good and evil
Angels attending every particular Perfon, tis a
good Allegory indeed to reprefent the Struggle in
the Mind of Man- between good and evil Incli
nations j but as to the reil, the beft Thing I can
lay of it is,
that I think *tis a Fib.
But ta take Things as they are, and only talk
by way of natural Confequence, for to argue from
Nature is
certainly the beft Way to find out the
Devil s
Story &amp;gt;
if there are good and evil Spirits
attending us, that is to fay, a good Angel and a
Dcvil^ then tis no unjuifc Reproach upon any
Body to fay,
when they follow the Dictates of
the latter, &quot;the Devil is in them &amp;gt;
or they are
Devils*, nay, I mud carry it farther ftill, namely,
that as the Generality and greater!:
Number of
People do follow and obey the evil Spirit and not
the good, and that the predominate Power is al-
low d to be the nominating Power j you mull
then allow, that inihort, the greater Part of Man
kind
of the DEVI L. 243
kind has the Devil in them,, and fo I come to my
Text.
To this Purpofe give me leave to borrow a few
Lines of a Friend on this very Part of the Devil s
Management.
To Places and Perfons he (bits his Difguifes,
And drefles up all his Banditti,
Who as Pickpockets flock to a Country Affixes,
Croud up to the Court and the City,
They re at
every Elbow and every Ear,
And ready at every cal!5
N
Sir$
The vigilant Scout plants his Agents about,
And has fomething to do with us all. Sir.
Jn fome he has Part, and in fome he s the Whole,
And of fome (like the Vicar of Baddoiv)
It can neither be faid
they have Body or Soul,
But only are Devils in Shadow.
The Pretty and Witty, are Devils in Mafquc,
The Beauties are meer Apparitions}
The homely alone by their Faces are known,
And the Good by their ugly Conditions.
TheBeaus walk about like the Shadows ofMen.
And wherever he leads em they follow,
Buttak em and fhak em, there s not one in ten
But s as light as a Feather and hollow.
Thus all his Affairs he drives on in Difguife,
And he tickles Mankind with a Feather :
Creeps in at our Ears, and looks out at our Eyes?
And jumbles our Senfes together,
R 2 He
244 The Modern HISTORY
He raifesthe Vapours., and prompts the Defires,-
Andto ev ry dark Deed holds the Candle j
The Paffions enflames and the Appetite fires,
And takes ev ry Thing by the Handle.
Thus he walks up and down in compleat Maf-
And with every Company mixes, (querade,
Sells in every Shop, works at every Trade,.
And ev ry Thing doubtful perplexes.
How Satan comes by this governing Influence
in the Minds and upon the Actions of Men, is a
Queftion I am not yet come to, nor indeed does
it fo particularly belong to the Devil s
Hiftory ,
it feems rather a Polemick, fo it may pafs at School
among the Metaphyficks, and puzzle the Heads
of our Mailers j wherefore I think to write to the
learned Dr. B about it, imploring his mofl
fublime Haughtinefs, that when his other more
momentons Avocations of Pedantry and Pedago-
gifm will give him an Interval from Wrath and
Contention, he will fet
apart a Moment to con-
fider human Nature Deviliz d, and give us a Ma
thematical Anatomical Defcription of it 5 with a
Map of Satan s
Kingdom in the Microcofm of
Mankind, and fuch other Illuminations as to him
and his Contemporaries

Of tie DevilV Management in the
Hierarchy by Omens^ Entrails, Augurs?
Oracles, andjuch like ^Pageantry ofHell j
and how they went off the Stage at laft by
the Introduction of true Religion.
I
Have adjourn d, not finiih d, my Account of
the Devil s fecret Management by Pojfcjfflon9
and fhall reaflume it, in its Place j but I mult take
leave to mention fome other Parts of his retired
Scheme, by which he has hitherto manag d Man
kind, and the firft of thele is by that Fraud of all
Frauds call d Oracle.
Here his Trumpet yielded an uncertain Sound
for fome Ages, and like what he was, and accord
ing to what he pra&ifed from the Beginning, hede-
liver d outFalfhood and Dclufion by Retale : The
Priefts of Apollo acted this Farce for him to a
great Nicety at Delptoos -,
there were divers others
at the fame Time, and fome, which to give the
Devil his due, he had very little Hand in, as we
ihall fee prefently.
There were alfo fome fmaller, fome greater, fome
more, fome lefs famous Places where thofe Oracles
were feated, and Audience given to the Enquirers,
in all which the .2&amp;gt;w7,or fome Body for him, Per-
mijfa Superlorumj for either vindictive or other
hidden Ends and Purpofes, was allow d to make
at leaft a Pretenfion to the Knowledge of Things
to come -
y but, as publick Cheats generally do, they
a6bed in Mafquerade, and gave fuch uncertain
and inconfiftent Refponfes, that they were oblig d
R 3 to
The Modern HISTORY
to ufe the utmoft Art to reconcile Events to the
Prediction, even after things were come to pafs.
Here the Devil was a lying Spirit^ in a parti&quot;
cular and extraordinary manner, in the Mouths of
all the Prophets 5 and yet he had the Cunning to
exprefs himfelf fo, that whatever happen d, the
Oracle was fuppos d to have meant as it fell out ,
and fo all their Augurs, Omens and Voices, by
which the Devil amus d the World, not at that
Time only, but fincc, have been likewife inter
preted.
Julian the Apoftate dealt mightily in thefe A-
mufements, but the Devil, who neither wifh d
his Fall, or
prefag d it to him, evidenc d that he
Icnew nothing of Julian s Fate 5 for that, as ho
fent almoft to all the Oracles of the Eaft, and
fummon d all the Priefts together to inform him
of the Succefs of his Perjian Expedition, they
all, like Ahab s
Prophets^ having a lying Spirit in
them, encoijrag d him and promis d him Succefs.
Nay, all the ill Omens which difturb d him,
they prefag d good from &amp;gt;
for Example^ he was
at a prodigious Expence when he was at Antloch
to buy up white Beads, and white Fowls, for Sa
crifices, and for predicting from the Entrails 5
from whence the Antiocbians^ in contempt, call d
him Vtftlmarim\ but whenever the Entrails fore
boded Evil, the cunning Devil made the Priefts
put a different Conflruftion upon them, and pro-
iiiife him Good : When he entred into the
Temple of the Genij to offer Sacrifice, one of
the Priefts dropt clown dead &amp;gt;
this, had it had
any Signification more than a Man falling
dead jof
an Apoplectic, would have fignified fbmething
fatal to Julian^ who made himfelf a Brother Sa-
crill or Prieft -,
whereas the Priefts turn d it
pre-
fently
to
fignify the Death of his Colleague, the
Confu! Salluftt which happened juft at the fame
Time,
of the DEVIL. 247
Time, tho eight hundred Miles off 5 fo in ano
ther Cafe, Julian thought it ominous that he,
who was AttguftiiS)
fhould be nam d with two
other Names of Perfons, both already dead 5 the
Cafe was thus, the Stile of the Emperor was Juli-
anus Fceltx Auguftus, and two of his principal Of
ficers were Juli&nus and Foelix -,
now both Julianut
and Foelix died within a few Days of one another,
which diflurb d Him much, who was the third
of the three Names &amp;gt;
but his flattering Devil told
him it all imported Good to him (wz.) that tho
Julianus and F&Jix fhould die, Auguftus fhould
be immortal.
Thus whatever happened, and whatever was
foretold, and how much foever they differ d from
one another, the lying Spirit was fure to recon
cile the Prediction and the Event^ and make them
at leaft feem to correfpond in Favour of the Per-
foil
enquiring.
Now we are told Oracles are ceafed, and the
Devil is farther limited for the Good of Mankind,
not being allow d to vent his Delufions by the
Mouths of the Priefts and Augurs, as formerly :
1 will not take upon me to fay how far they are
really ceas d, more than they were before ; I think
tis much more reafonable to believe there was
never any Reality in them at all, or that any Ora
cle ever gave out any Anfwers but what were the
Invention of the Priefts and the Delations of the
.DEVIL ; I have a great many antient Authors on
sny Side in this Opinion, as Eufebius^ fertulliani
Ariftotk) and others, who as they liv d fo near the
Pagan Times, and when even fomeof thofe Rites
were yet in Ufe, they had much more Reafon to
know, and could probably pafs a better Judgment
upon them ; nay Cicero himfelf ridicules them
in the openeft manner 5 again, other Authors de-
fcend to Particular and fhew how the Cheat was
R 4 manag d
The Modern HISTORY
manag d by the Heathen Sacrifts and Priefts, and
in what enthuflaftic manner they fpoke ; namely,
by going into the hollow Images, iuch as the bra
zen Bull and the Image of dpollo ,
and how fub-
tilly they gave out duhious and ambiguous Anfwers $
that when the People did not find their Expecta
tions anfwer d by the Event, they might be im-
pofed upon by the Priefts, and confidently told
they did not rightly underftand the Oracle s
Meaning :
However, I cannot fay but that indeed
there are fome Authors of good Credit too, who
will have it that there was a real prophetic Spi
rit in the Voice or Anfwers given by the Ora
cles, and that oftentimes they were miraculouf-
Jy exact in thofe Anfwers $ and they give that of
the Delphic Oracle anfwering the Queftion which
was given about Crosfus for an Example, viz.
what Croefus was doing at that time ? to w/&amp;gt;,
that
he was boiling a Lamb and the Flefli of a Tor-
toife together, in a brafs VefTel, or Boiler, with
a Cover of the fame Metal &amp;gt;
that is to fay,
in a
Kettle with a brafs Cover.
To affirm therefore, that they were all Cheats,
a Man muft encounter with Antiquity, and fet
his private Judgment up againft an eftablifh d O-
pinion 5 but tis no matter for that j if I do not fee
any thing in that received Opinion capable of E~
vidence, much Jefs of Demonftration, I mufl be
allow d flill to think as I do &amp;gt;
others may believe
as they lift j I fee
nothing hard or difficult in
the Thing j the Priefts, who were always hifto-
rically inforrn d of the Circumftances of the En
quirer, or at leaft
fomething about them, might
cidly find fome ambiguous Speech to make, and
put fome double Entendre upon them, which
upon the Event folv d the Credit of the Oracle3
were it one way or other ; and this they certainly
did, or we have room to think the DEVIL knows
lefs
of the D E V I L.
kjs of Things now than he did in former
Days.
Ic is true that by thefe Delations the Priefh
got infinite Sums of Money, and this makes it
itill
probable that they would labour hard, and
ufe the utmofl of their Skill to uphold the Cre
dit of their Oracles &amp;gt;
and tis a full Difcovery, as
well of the Subtlety of the Sacrifts, as of the Ig
norance and Stupidity of the People, in thole
early Days of Satan s Witchcraft 5 to fee what
merry Work the Devil made with the World,
and what grofs Things he put upon Mankind :
Such was the Story of the Dordonian Oracle in
Epirus, viz. That two Pigeons flew out of
Thebes (N. E. it was the Egyptian Thebes) from
the Temple of Belus^ ere&ed there by the an-
tient Sacrilts, and that one of thefe fled Eail-
ward into Lybia^ and the Defarts of Africk^ and
the other into Greece^ namely, to Dordona, and
thefe communicated the divine Myfteries to one
another, and afterwards gave myitical Solutions
to the devout Enquirers j firil the Dordonian Pi-
fson
perching upon an Oak fpoke audibly to the
eople there, that the Gods commanded them
to build an Oracle, or Temple, to Jupiter^ in
that Place &amp;gt;
which was accordingly done : The
other Pigeon did the like on the Hill in Africa^
where it commanded them to build another to
Jupiter Ammon^ or Hammon.
Wife Cicero contemned all this, and, as Authors
tell us, ridiculed the Anfwer, which, as I have
hinted above, the Oracle gave to Crcefus^ prov
ing that the Oracle it felf was a Liar, that it
could not come from Apollo^ for that Apollo ne
ver fpoke Latin: In a Word, Cicero reje&ed them
all, and Demofthenes alfo mentions the Cheats of
the Oracles j when fpeaking of the Oracle of A-
j
he faid, Pithin Philippiz d; that is,
that
when
250 The Modern HISTORY
\vhen the Priefts were brib d with Money, they
always gave their Anfwers in favour of Philip of
Macedon.
But that which is moft ftrange to me is, that
in this Difpute about the Reality of Oracles, the
Heathen who made ufe of them are the People
who expofe them, and who infift moil pofitively
upon their being Cheats and Impoftors, as in par
ticular thofe mentioned above -,
while the Chri-
tians who reje6t them, yet believe they did re
ally foretel
Things, anfwer Queftions, &c. on
ly with this Difference, that the Heathen Authors
who oppofe them, infill that tis all Delufion and
Cheat, and charge it
upon the Priefts ; and the
Chriitian Oppofers infift that it was real, but that
the Devi^ not the Gods, gave the Anfwers &amp;gt;
and
that he was permitted to do it
by a fuperiorPow*
*,
to magnify that Power in the total filcncing
them at laft.
But, as I (aid before, I am with the Heathen
here, againft the Chriftian Writers, for I take it
all to be a Cheat and Delufion : I mud give my
Reafon for it, or I do nothing; my Reafon is
this, I infifl Satan is as blind in Matters of Fu
turity, as we are, and can tell nothing of what is
to come 5 thefe Oracles often pretending to pre-
di6r, could be nothing elfe therefore but a Cheat
fbrm d by the Money-getting Priefts to amufe
the World, and bring Grift to their Mill : If I
meet with any thing in my Way to open my Eyes
to a better Opinion of them, I {hall tell it
you as
I go on.
On the other hand, whether the Devil really
fpake in thofe Oracles, or fet the cunning Priefts
to fpeak for him &amp;gt;
whether they predicted, or
only made the People believe they predicted;
whether they gave Anfwers which came to pafs,
or prevailed upon the People to believe that
what
of the DEVIL; 251
was faid did come to pafs, it was much at
one, and fully anfwer d the Devil s End $ namely,
to amufe and delude the World ; and as to do,
or to caufe to be done, is the fame Part of Speech,
fo whoever did it, the Devil s Intereft was carried
on by it, his Government preferv d, and all the
Mifchief he could defire was effectually brought
to pafs, fo that every way they were the Devil s
Oracles, that s out of the Queftion.
Indeed I have wonder d iometimes why, fince
by this Sorcery the Devil performed fuch Won
ders, that is, play d fo many Tricks in the World,
and had fuch univerfal Succefs, he fhould fet
up
no more of them j but there might be a great ma
ny Reafons given for that, too long to tire
you
with at prefent : &quot;Tis
true, there were not many
of them, and yet confidering what a great deal of
Bufinefs they difpatch d, it was enough, for fix
or eight Oracles were more than fufficient to a-
mufe all the World : The chief Oracles we meet
with in Hiftory are among the Greeks and the JR0-
ynanS) viz.
That of Jupiter Ammon, in Lylia^ as above.
The Dordonian^ in Epirus.
Apollo Delphicus, in the Country of Phocis
in Greece.
Apollo ClavtuS) in Afia Minor.
Serapis, in Alexandria in Egypt,
tfrophomisi in Bteotia.
Sybitta Cumaea^ in Italy.
Diana^ at Ephefus.
Apollo Daphneus^ at Antioch.
Befides many of lefler Note, in feveral other
Places, as I have hinted before.
I have nothing to do here with the Story, men
tioned by Plutarch, of a Voice being
heard at
252 The Modern HISTORY
Sea, fromfome of the Iflands calPd
and calling upon one Thamuz^ an Egyytian^ who
was on board a Ship, bidding him, when he came
to the Pakde^ other Jflands in the Ionian Seas,
tell them there that the great God PAN was dead 5
and when Thamuz perform d it, great Groanings,
and Howlings, and Lamentation were heard from
the Shore.
This Tale tells but indifferently, tho indeed
it looks more like a Chriftian Fable^
than a Pa
gan 5 becaufe it feems as if made to honour the
Chriftian Worfhip, and blaft all the Pagan Ido
latry ; and for that Reafon I reje6t it, the Chri
ftian Profeflion needing no fuch fabulous Stuff to
confirm it.
Nor is it true in fat, tnat tne Oracles did
ceafe immediately upon the Death of Chrift^
but, as I noted before, the Sum of the Matter
is this 5 the Chriftian Religion fpreading it felf
univerfally, as well as miraculouily, and that too
by the Foolijhnefs of Preaching^ into all Parts of
the World, the Oracles ceas d 5 that is to fay,
their Trade ceas d, their Rogueries were daily
detected, the deluded People being better taught,
came no more after them, and being afham d, as
veil as difcourag d, they fneak d out of the
World as well as they could j in ihort the Cu-
ftomers fell off, and the Priefts, who were the
Shopkeepers, having no Buflnefs to do, fhut up
their Shops, broke, and went away j the Trade
and the Tradefmen were hifs d off the Stage toge
ther j
fo that theZ)^/, who, it mult be confefs d,
got infinitely by the Cheat, became bankrupt,
and was oblig d to fet other Engines at work, as
other Cheats and Deceivers do, who when one
Trick grows ftale, and will ferve no longer, arc
fqrc d to try another.
Nor
of the D EVIL: 253
Nor was the Devil to feek in new Meafures j
for tho he could not give out his delufive Trail*
as he did before, in Pomp and State, with the
Solemnity of a Temple and a Set of Enthufiafts
call d Priefls, who plaid a thoufand Tricks to
amufe the World, he then had Recourfe to his
old Egyptian Method, which indeed was more
antient than that of Oracles j and that was by Ma
gic, Sorcery, Familiars, Witchcraft, and the like.
Of this we find the people of the South, that
is, of Arabia, and Chaldea were the firft, from
whence we are told of the Wife Men, that is to
fay, Magicians, were call d Chaldeans and South*
fayers. Hence alfo we find Ahaziah the King of
Jfrael fent to Eaalzebub the God of Ekron, to
enquire whether he fhould live or die ? This fome
think was a kind of an Oracle, tho others think
it was only fome over-grown Magician, who
counterfeited himfelf to be a Devil, and obtain d
upon that Idol-hunting Age to make a Cunning
Man of him $ and for that Purpofe he got him
felf made a Prieft of Baalzebub, the God of
Ekron, and gave out Anfwers in his Name.
Thus thofe merry Fellows in Egypt, Jannes and
Jambres, are faid to mimick Mofes and Aaron,
when they work d the miraculous Plagues upon
the Egyptians ; and we have fome Inftances in
Scripture that fupport this, fuch as the Witch of
Endor, the King ManaJJes, who dealt with the
Devil openly, and had a Familiar ; the Woman
mentioned dfts xvi. who had a Spirit of Divi-
nation^ and who got Money by playing the Ora
cle 5 that is, anfwering doubtful Queftions, &c.
which Spirit, or Devil, the Apoftles caft out.
Now tho it is true that the old Women in the
World have filPd us with Tales, fome improba
ble, others impoffible ; fome weak, fome ridicu
lous, and that this puts a general Discredit upon all
the
154 The Modern M I S f O R Y
the graver Macrons, who entertain us with StcM
ries better put together , yet tis certain, and I
muft be allow d to affirm, that the Devil does
not difdain to take into his Service many Troops
of good Old JVomen^ and Old Women-Men too5
who he finds tis for his Service to keep in conftant
Pay &amp;gt;
to thefe he is found frequently to com
municate his Mind, and oftentimes we find them
fuch Proficients, that they know much more than
the Devil can teach them.
How far our antient Friend Merlin^ or the
frave
Matron his (Satan s) moil trufty and weli-
eloved Coufin and Counfellor, Mother Shipton^
were commiffioned by him to give one their pro
phetic Oracles, and what degree of Pofleflion he
may have arrived to in them upon their Midnight
Excurfions, I will not undertake to prove ;. but
that he might be acquainted with them both, as
well as with feveral of our modern Gentlemen, I
will not deny neither.
I confefs it is not very incongruous with the
Devil s
Temper, or with the Nature of his
Bufinefs, to fhift hands &amp;gt;
poflibly he found that
he had tried the World with Oracular Cheats &amp;gt;
that Men began to, be forfeited with them, and
grew fick of the Frauds which were fo fre
quently detefted $ that it was time to take new
Meafures, and contrive fome new Trick to Bite
the World, that he might not be expos d to Con
tempt &amp;gt;
or perhaps he fa\v the Approach of new
Light, which the Chriilian Do&rine bringing
with it
began to fpread in the Minds of Men j
that it would out-fhine the dim burning ignis
fatuuS) with which he had fo long cheated Man
kind, and was afraid to ftand it, left he fhould
be mobb d oft the Stage by his own People, when
their Eyes fhould begin to open : That upon this
foot he might in Policy withdraw from tbofe old
i Retreats
of the DEVIL: 255
Retreats the Oracles, and reftrain thofe Refponfes
before they loft all their Credit ; for we find the
People (eem d to be at a mighty Lofs for fome
time, for want of them, fo that it made them
run up and down to Conjurers, and Man-Gojfips^
to brazen Heads, fpeaking Calves, and innume
rable fimple Th ngs, fo grofs that they are fcarce
fit to be named, to fktisfy the Itch of having their
Fortunes told them, as we call it.
Now as the DEVIL is
very feldom blind to his
own Intereft, and therefore thought fit to quit
his old way of impofing upon the World by his
Oracles, only
becaufe he found the World began
to be too wife to be impofed upon that way 5 fo
on the other hand, finding there was 11 ill a Pof-
fibilicy
to delude the World, tho by other In-
ftruments, he no fooner laid down his Oracles,
and the folemn Pageantry, magnificent Appear
ances, and other Frauds of his Priefts and Vota
ries, in their Temples and Shrines 5 but he fet up
a new Trade, and having, as I have faid, Agents
and Inftruments fufficient for any Bufinefs that he
could have to employ them in, he begins in Cor
ners, as the learned and merry Dr. Brown fays,
and exercifes his minor Trumperies by way of
his own contriving, lifting
a great Number of
new-found Operators, fuch as Witches, Magi
cians, Diviners, Figure-caftcrs, Aflrologers, and
fuch inferior Seducers.
Now it is
true, as that Doctor fays,
this was
running into Corners, as if he had been expell d
his more triumphant way of giving Audience in
Form, which for fo
many Ages had been allow d
him &amp;gt;
yet I muft add, that as it feem d to be the
DEVIL S own doing, from a right Judgment of
his Affairs, which had taken a new Turn in the
World, upon the ihining of new Lights from
the Chriftian Doctrine, fo it muft be acknow
ledged
The Modern HISTORY
*edged the Devil made himfelf amends upon Man
kind, by the various Methods he took, and the
Multitude of Inftruments he employ d^ and per
haps deluded Mankind in a more fatal and fenfi-
ble manner than he did before, tho not fo uni-
verfally.
He had indeed before more Pomp and Figure
put upon it, and he cheated Mankind then in a
Way of Magnifience and Splendor 5 but this
was not in above eight or ten principal Places, and
not fifty Places in all, public or private j whereas
now fifty thoufand of his Angels and Inilruments,
vifible and invifible, hardly may be faid to fuffice
for one Town or City j but in ihort, as his invi
fible Agents fill the Air, and are at hand for Mif-
chief on every Emergence, fo his vifible Fools
iwartn in every Village, and you have fcarce a
Hamlet or a Town but his EmifTaries are at Hand
for Bufinefs &amp;gt;
and which is flill worfe, in all Pla
ces he finds Bufinefs, nay even where Religion is
planted and feems to flouriflij yet he keeps his
Ground and pufhes his Intereft according to what
has been faid elfewhere] upon the fame Subject,
that wherever Religion plants, the Devil plants
clofe by it.
Nor, as I fay, does he fail of Succefs, Delufion
fpreads like a Plague, and the Devil is fure of Vo
taries y like a true Mountebank, he can always
bring a Croud about his Stage, and that fome
Times falter than other People.
What I obferve upon this Subject is this, that
the World is at a ftrange Lofs for want of the
Devil ; if it was not fo, what s the Reafbn, that
upon the filencing the Oracles, and Religion tell
ing them that Miracles are ceas d, and that God
has done fpeaking by Prophets, they never enquire
whether Heaven has eftablinYd any other or new
Way of Revelation, but away they ran with
their
of the DEVIL. 257
their Doubts and Difficulties to thefe Dreamers
of Dreams, Tellers of Fortunes, and perfonal
Oracles to be refolv d 5 as if when they acknow
ledge the Devil is dumb, thefe could fpeak $ and
as if the wicked Spirit could do more than the
Good, the Diabolical more than the Divine^ or
that Heaven having taken away the DEVI L S
Voice, had furnifh d him with an Equivalent, by
allowing Scolds, Termagants, and old weak and
fuperannuated Wretches to fpeak for him j for
thefe are the People we go to now in our Doubts
and Emergencies.
While this Blindnefs continues among us, tis
Nonfenfe to fay that Oracles are filenced, or the
Devil is
dumb, for the Devil gives Audience It-ill
by his Deputies 5 only as Jeroboam made Priefls
of the meaner! of the People, fo he is
grown a
little humble, and makes life of meaner Inftru-
ments than he did before j for whereas the Priefts
of Apollo, and of Jupiter^ were fplendid in their
Appearance, of grave and venerable Afpec~b, and
fometimes of no mean Quality 5 now he makes
ufe of Scoundrels and Rabble, Beggars and Va
gabonds, old Hags, fuperannuated miferable Her
mits, Gypfies and -Strollers, the Pictures of Envy
and ill Luck.
Either the Devil is
grown an ill Matter, and
gives but mean Wages, that he can get no better
Servants 5 or elfe Common Senfe is
grown very
low prized and contemptible 5 that fuch as thefe
are fit Tools to continue the SuccefHon of Fraud,
and carry on the Devifs Inter-eft in the World &amp;gt;
for were not the Paffions and Temper of Man
kind deeply pre-engaged in favour of this dark
Prince, we could never fuffer our felves to accept
of his Favours by the Hands of fuch contempt!-*
ble Agents as thefe ! How do we receive his O-
racles from an old Witch of particular Eminence,
S and
2j 8 The Modern HISTORY
and who we believe to be more than ordinarily
infpir d from Hell &amp;gt;
I (ay, we receive the Oracle
with Reverence ; that is to fay, with a kind of
Horror, with regard to the Black Prince it comes
from, and at the fame time turn our Faces away
from the Wretch that mumbles out the Anfwcrs,
left fhe fhould caft an Evil Eye^ as we call it,
upon us, and put a Devil into us when fhe plays
the Devil before us? How do we liften to the
Cant of thofe worft of Vagabonds the Gypfies^
when at the fame time we watch our Hedges and
Hen-roofts for fear of their thieving ?
Either the DEVIL ufes us more like Fools than
he did our Anceftors, or we really are worfc
Fools than thofe Ages produced, for they were
never deluded by fuch low-priz d Devils as we
are 5 by fuch defpicable Bridewell DEVILS, that
are fitter for a Whipping-poft than an Altar, and
inftead of being received as the Voice of an Ora
cle, fhould be fent to the Houfe of Corre&ion
for Pick-pockets.
Nor is this accidental, and here and there one
of thefe Wretches to be feen, but infhort, if it has
been in other Nations as it is with us, I do not fee
that the DEVIL was able to get any better People
into his Pay, or at leaft very rarely : Where have
we fecn any thing above a Tinker turn Wizard ?
and where have we had a Witch of Quality a-
mong us, Mother Je gs excepted ? and if
fhe had not been more of fomething elfe than a
Witch, twas thought fhe had never got fo much
Money by her Profeffion.
Magicians, Southfayers, Devil-raifers, and fuch
People, we have heard much of, but feldom a-
bove the Degree of the meaneft of the mean
People, the loweft of the loweft Rank : Indeed
the Word Wife Men^ which the Devil wou d
fain have had his Agents honour d with, was
% ufed
of the DEVI L. 259
tifed a while in Egypt^ and in Perfia, among the
Chaldeans^ but it continued but a little while,
and never reach d fo far Northward as our Coun
try &amp;gt; nor, however the Devil has managed it,
have many of our great Men, who have been
moft acquainted with him, ever been able to ac
quire the Title of Wife Men.
I have heard that in older Times, I
fuppofe in
good Queen Befs\ Days, or beyond, (for little is
to be faid here for any thing on this Side of her
time) there were fome Couritellors and Statefmen
who merited the Character of &?/?, in the beft
Senfej that is to fay, good^ and ivife^ as
they
fland in Conjunction &amp;gt;
but as to what has hap-
pen d (ince that, or, as we may call it, from that
Queen s Funeral to the late Revolution, I have
little to fay -,
but I ll tell
you what honeft An
drew Marvel faid of thofe Times, and by that
you may, if
you pleafe, make your Calculation or
let it alone, tis all one.
&quot;
To fee a white Staff-maker, a Beggar, a Lord,
&quot;
And fcarce a wife Man at a long Council-Board.
But I may be told this relates to wife Men in
another Conftitution, or wife Men as they are
oppofcd to Fools 5 whereas we are talking of them
now under another Clafs, namely, as Wifemen or
Magicians, South-fayers, &c. fuch as were in
former Times call d by that Name.
But to this I anfwer, that take them in which
Senfe you pleafe, it
may be the fame 5 for if I
were to ask the Devil the Character of the beft
States-man he had employ d among us for many
Years paft, I am apt to think that tho Oracles
are ceafed, he would honeftly, according to the
old ambiguous Way, when I ask d if they were
Chriftians, anfwer they were (his) Privy-Coun-
filhrs. S z It
*&amp;lt;so The Modern HISTORY
It is but a little while ago, that I happened (in
Converfation) to meet with a long Lift of the Magi-
ilrates of that Age, in a neighbouring Country) that
is to fay, the Men of Fame among them j and it
was a very diverting Thing to fee the Judgment
which was pafs d upon them among a great deal of
good Company j it is not for me to tell
you how
many white Staves, Golden Keys, Marefhals Ba-
toons. Cordons Blue5 Gordon Rouge and Gordon
Blanc, there were among them, or by what Ti
tles, as Dukes, Counts, Marquis, Abbor, Bi(hop,
or Juflice they were to be diitinguifh d ; but the
marginal Notes I found upon moft of them were
( being mark d with an Afterifm) as follows.
Such a Duke, fuch eminent Offices added to
his Titles (
* in the Margin) No Saint.
Such an Arch with the Title of Noble
added, No Archangel.
Such an eminent Statefman and prime Minifter,
No Witch.
Such a Ribbon with a Set of great Letters
added, No Conjurer.
It prefently occurred to me that tho Oracles
were ceafed, and we had now no more double
Entendre in fuch a
Degree as before, yet that am
biguous Anfwers were not at an End &amp;gt;
and that
whether thofe Negatives were meant fo by the
Writers, or not, twas certain Cuftom led the
Readers to conclude them to be Satyrs, that they
were to be rung backwards like the Bells when
the Town s on fire &amp;gt;
tho in fhort, I durft not
read them backward any where, but as fpcaking
of foreign People, for fear of railing the Devil
I am talking of.
But to return to the Subject 5 to fuch mean
Things is the DEVIL now reduc d in his ordina
ry Way of carrying on hisBufinefs in the World,
that his Oracles are delivered now by the Bellmen
and
of the DEVIL. 261
and the Chimney-Sweepers, by the meaneft of
thofe that fpeak in the Dark, and if he operates
by them, you may expe6t it
accordingly j his
Agents fecm to me as if the DEVIL had fingl d
them out by their Deformity, or that there was
fomething particular requir d in their Afpect ta
qualify them for their Employment ; whence it is
become proverbial, when our Looks are very dif-
mal and frightful,
to fay, I look like a Witch, or
in other Cafes to fay, as ugly as a Witch 5 in ano
ther Cafe to look as envious as a Witch j now
whether there is
any Thing particularly requir d
in the Looks of the DEVIL S modern Agents,
which is
affirting in
theDifcharge of their Offices,
and which make their Anfwers appear more fo-
lemn, this the Devil has not yet reveaPd, at leaft
not to me &amp;gt;
and therefore why it is that he fingles
out fuch Creatures as are fit
only to fright the
People that come to them with their Enquiries,
I do not take upon me to determine.
Perhaps it is
necefTary they fhould be thus ex
traordinary in their Afpect, that they might ftrike
an Awe into the Minds of their Votaries, as if
they were Satan s true and real Reprefentatives j
and that the faid Votaries may think when they
fpeak to the Witches they are really talking
to the Devil , or perhaps tis
neceflary to the
Witches themfelves, that they fhould be fo ex-
quifitely ugly, that they might not be fiu priz d
at whatever Figure the Devil makes when he firft
appears to them, being certain they can fee no
thing uglier than themfelves.
Some are of the Opinion that the Communica
tion with the Devil, or between the Devil and
thofe Creatures his Agents, has fomething af-
fimulating in it, and that if they were tolerable
before, they are, ipfo fattoy turn d into DEVILS
by talking with him &amp;gt;
I will not fey but that a
S j Tremor
262 The Modern HISTORY
Tremor in the Limbs, a Horror in the AfpecT:, and
a furpnzing Stare in the Eyes may feize. upon
ibme of them when they really fee the DEVIL,
and that the frequent Repetition may make thofe
Diitortions, which we io conftantly fee in their
Faces becomes natural to them j by which if it
does not continue always upon the Countenance,
they can at lead, like the Pofture-Mafters^ can:
themfelvcs into fuch Figures and frightful Dif-
locations of the Lines and Features in their Faces,
and fo afiiime a Devil s Face fui table to the Occa-
fion, or as may fervc the t urn for which they take
it up, and as often as they have any ufe for it.
But be it which of thefe the Enquirer pieafcs,
tis all one to the Cafe in Hand &amp;gt;
this is certain,
that fuch deform d Devil-like Creatures, moil of
thofe we call Hags and Witches^ are in their Shapes
and Afpecfo, and that they give out their Senten
ces and frightful Meflages with an Air of Re
venge for fome Injury received &amp;gt;
for Witches are
fam d chiefly for doing Mifchief.
It feems the Devil has always pick d out the
mofl ugly and frightful old Women to do his
Bufinefs 3 Mother Shifton^ our famous Euglifa
Witch or Prophetels, is
very much wrong d in
her Picture, if fhc was not of the moil terrible
Afpecl: imaginable ; and if it be true that Merlin^
the famous Welch Fortune-Teller, was a fright
ful Figure, it will feem the more rational to be
lieve, if we credit another Story, (viz.) that he
was begotten by the Devil himfelf, of which I
fhall fpeak by it felf : But to go back to the De
vil s Inftruments being fo uglyj it
may be ob-
ferved, I fay, that the Devil has always dealt in
fuch fort of Cattle ; the Sybils^ of whom fo many
ftrange prophetic Things are recorded, whether
true or no is not to the Queftion, are (if the Ita
lian Painters may have any Credit given them)
all
of the DEVIL. 263
all
reprefented as very old Women j and as if Ug-
linefs were a Beauty to old Age, they feem to
paint them out as
ugly and frightful as (not they,
the Painters) but even as the Devil himfelf could
make them 5 not that I believe there are any ori
ginal Pictures of them really extant &amp;gt;
but it is not
unlikely that the Italians might have fome tradi
tional Knowledge of them, or fome remaining
Notions of them, or particularly that antient Sy
bil named jfms, who fold the fatal Book to far-
quin
-
y tis (aid of her that Taiquin fuppofed fhe
doated with Age.
I had Thoughts indeed here to have entred into
a learned Difquifition of the Excellency of old
Women in all diabolical Operations, and parti
cularly of the Neceffity of having recourie to
them for Satans more exquifite Administration,
which alfo
may ferve to folve the great Difficulty
in the natural Philofophy of Hell $ namely, why
it comes to pafs that the Devil is
obliged for want
of old Women, properly fo call d, to turn fo
many antient Fathers, grave Counfellors both of
Law and State, and efpecially Civilians or Doc
tors of the Law into old Women, and how the
extraordinary Operation is
perform d 5 but this, as
a Thing of great Confequence in Satan s
Manage
ment of humane Affairs, and particularly as it
may
lead us into the neceflary Hif
lory, as well as Cha
racters of fome of the moil eminent of thefe Sects
among us, I have purpofely referv d for a Work
by it felf, to be publifti d, if Satan hinders not^ in
fifteen Volumes in Folio, wherein I fhall in the
firft Place define in the moft exact Manner pof-
fible, what is to be understood by a Male old
Woman^ of what heterogeneous Kind they are
produced, give you the monftrous Anatomy of
the Parts, and efpecially thofe of the Head, which

without, but particularly hollow in the Cavity, de
fines molt philofophically that antient paradoxi
cal Saying, (viz.) being full of Emptinefs, and
makes it
very confident with Nature and com
mon Senfe.
I fhall likewife fpend fome Time, and it muftbe
Labour too, I affure you^ when tis done^ in deter
mining whether this new Species of Wonderfuls
are not deriv d from that famous old Woman Mer-
// ,
which I
prove to be very reafonable for us to
fuppofe, becaufe of the many feveral judicious
Authors, who affirm the faid Merlin^ as I hinted
before, to have been begotten by the Devil.
As to the deriving his Gift of Prophefy from
the Devil, by that pretended Generation, I ihall
omit that Part, becaufe, as I have all along infif-
ted upon it, that Satan himfelf has no prophe
tic or predicting Powers of his own, it is not
very clear to me that he could convey it to his
Pofterity, nil dat quod not habet.
However, in deriving this fo much magnified
Prophet in a right Line [from the Devil^ much
may be faid in favour of his ugly Face, in which
it was faid he was very remarkable, for it is no,
new Thing for a Child to belike the Father j but

CHAP. VI.
Of the extraordinary Appearance of the
Devil, and particularly of the Cloven-
Foot.
SOme
People would fain have us treat this
Tale of the DeviFs appearing with a Cloven-
Foot with more Solemnity than I believe the
Devil himfelf does 5 for Satan, who knows how
much of a Cheat it is, mull certainly ridicule it,
in his own Thoughts, to the laft
Degree 5 but as
he is glad of any Way to hoodwink the Under-
ftandings, and bubble the weak Part of the World j
fo if he fees Men willing to take every Scarecrow
for a Devil, it is not his Bufinefs to undeceive
them j on the other Hand, he finds it his In-
terefl to fofter the Cheat, and ferve himfelf of
the Confequence : Nor could I doubt but the De
vil, if any Mirth be allow d him, often laughs at
the many frightful Shapes and Figures we drefs
him up in, and efpecially to fee how willing we
are firfl to paint him as black, and make him ap
pear as ugly as we can, and then flare and flart at
the Spectrum of our own making.
The Truth is, that among all the Horribles
that we drefs up Satan in, I cannot but think
we fhew the lead of Invention in this of a
Goat, or a Thing with a Goat s Foot, of all the
reft} for tho a Goat is a Creature made life of by
our Saviour in the Allegory of the Day of Judg
ment, and is faid there to reprefent the wicked
reje&ed Party, yet it feems to be only on Account
of their Similitude to the Sheep, and fo to repre
fent the juft Fate of Hypocrily and Hypocrites,
and in particular to form the neceflary Antithc-
fis
266 The Modern HISTORY
fis in the Story j for elfe, our whimjical Fancies ex-
cepted, a Sheep or a Lamb has a Cloven-Foot as
well as a Goat ; nay, if the Scripture be of any
Value in the Cafe, tis to the Devil s
Advantage,
for the dividing the Hoof was the
diftinguifhing
Character or Mark of a clean Beaft, and how the
Devil can be brought into that Number is
pretty
hard to fay.
One would have thought if we had intended
to have given a juft Figure of the Devil, it would
have been more appofite to have rank d him a-
mong the Cat-kind, and given him a Foot (if he
is to be known by his Foot) like a Lion, or like a
red Dragon, being the fame Creatures which he is
reprefented by in the Text, and fo his Claws would
have had fome Terror in them as well as his
Teeth.
But neither is the Goat a true Reprefentative
of the Devil at all, for we do not rank the Goats
among the fubtle or cunning Part of the Brutes ;
he is counted a fierce Creature indeed of his Kind,
tho nothing likethofe otherabovemention d 5 and
he is emblematically ufed to reprefent a luftful
Temper, but even that Part does not fully ferve
to defcribe the Devil, whofe Operation lies
prin
cipally another Way.
Befides it is not the Goat himfelf that is made
ufe of, tis the Cloven-Hoof only, and that fo
particularly, that the Cloven Foot of a Ram or a
Swine, or any other Creature, may ferve as well
as that of a Goat, only that Hiltory gives us fome
Caufe to call it the Goat s Foot.
In the next Place tis understood by us not as
a bare Token to know Satan by, but as if it were
a Brand upon him, and that like the Mark God
put upon Cain,it was given him fora Punifhment,
fo that he cannot get leave to appear without it,
nay cannot conceal it whatever other Drefs or
Difc
of the DEVIL; 267
Difguife he may put on ; and as if it was to make
him as ridiculous as poffible, they will have it be,
that whenever Satan has Occafion to drefs him-
felf in any humane Shape, be it of what Degree
foever, from the King to the Beggar, be it of a
fine Lady or ofan oldlVoman^ (the Latter it feems
he oftencft arTumes) yet ftill he not only muft have
this Cloven-Foot about him, but he is
oblig d to
{hew it too j nay, they will not allow him any
Drefs, whether it be a Prince s Robes, a Lord
Cha--- r s Gown, or a Lady s
Hoop and long
Petticoats, but the Cloven-Foot mufl be fhew d
from under them &amp;gt;
they will not fo much as allow
him an artificial Shoe or a Jack-Boot^ as we often
fee contriv d to conceal a Club-Foot or a ff^ooden-
Leg-y but that the Devil may be known where-
ever he goes, he is bound to ihew his Foot 5 they
might as well oblige him to fet a Bill upon his
Cap, as Folks do upon a Houfe to be let, and have
it written in capital Letters, I am the DEVIL.
It muft be confefs d this is
very particular, and
would be very hard upon the Devil^ if it had not
another Article in it, which is fome Advantage
to him, and that is, that the Fatt is not true; but
the Belief of this is fo univerfal, that all the World
runs away with it ; by which Mittake the good
People mifs the Devil many times where they
look for him, and meet him as often where they
did not expect him, and when for want of this
Cloven-Foot they do not know him.
Upon this very Account I have fometimes
thought, not that this has been put upon him by
meer Fancy, and the Cheat of a heavy Imagination,
propagated by Fable and Chymny-Corner Divi
nity, but that it has been a Contrivance of his
own 3 and that, in fhort, the Devil rais d this
Scandal upon himfelf, that he might keep his Dif
guife the better, and might go a.
Vifiting among
his
The ModernHlS TORY
his Friends without being known ; for were it
really fo, that he could go no where without
this particular Brand of Infamy, he could not
come into Company, could not dine with my
Lord Mayor, nor drink Tea with the Ladies, could
not go to the Drawing-R at ,
could
not have gone to Fountamblean to the King of
France s
Wedding, or to the Diet of Poland^ to
prevent the Grandees there coming to an Agree
ment j nay, which would be ftill
worfe than all^ he
could not go to the Mafquerade, nor to any of
our Balls &amp;gt;
the Reafon is
plain, he would be al
ways difcover d, expos d and forc d to leave the
good Company, or which would be as bad, the
Company would all
cry out the Devil and run
out of the Room as if they were frighted &amp;gt;
nor
could all the Help of Invention do him any Ser
vice, no Drefs he could put on would cover him ;
not all our Friends at T&viftock Corner could fur-
niih him with a Habit that would difguile or con
ceal him, this unhappy Foot would fpoil it all :
Now this would be ib great a Lois to him, that
I queltion whether he could carry on any of his
moll important Affairs in the World without it 5
for tho he has accefs to Mankind in his compleat
Difguife, I mean that of his Inviiibility, yet the
Learned very much agree in this, that his corpo-
jal Pretence in the World is
absolutely neceflary
upon many Occafions, to fupport his Intercft and
keep up his Correfpondences, and particularly to
encourage his Friends when Numbers are requi-
lite to carry on his Affairs $ but this Part I mall
have Occafion to fpeak of again, when I come to
confider him as a Gentleman of Bufinefs in his
Locality, and under the Head of vifible Appa*
rition ; but I return to the Foot.
As I have thus fuggefted that the Devil him-
felf has politically fpread about this Notion corv*
z cerning
ef the DEVIL: ;
2&amp;lt;s$&amp;gt;
earning his
appearing with a Cloven-Foot, fo I
doubt not that he has thought it for hisPurpofe to
paint this Cloven-Foot fo lively in the Imaginations
of many of our People, and efpccially of thofe clear
lighted Folks who fee the Devil when he is not to
be feen, that they would make no Scruple to fay, nay
and to make Affidavit too, even before Satan him-
felf, whenever he fat upon the Bench, that they
had feen his
Worfhip s FOOT at fuch and fuch a
Time-, this I advance the rather becaufe tis
very
much for his Intereft to do this, for if we had not
many WitnefTes, viva voce^ to teftify it, we fhould
have had fome obftinate Fellows always among
us, who would have denied the Fac~b, or at leait
have fpoken doubtfully of it, and fo have rais d
Difputes and Objections againft it, as impoffible,
or at leaft as
improbable 5 buzzing one ridiculous
Notion or other into our Ears, as if the Devil
was not fo black as he was painted, that he had
no more a Cloven- Foot than a Pope, v/hofe Apo-
ilolical Toes have fo often been reverentially kifs d
by Kings and Emperors : but now alas this Part is
out of the Queftion, not the Man in the Moon,
not the Groaning-Board, not the fpeaking of
Fryar Bacon s Brazen-Head, not the Infpiration
of Mother Shipton, or the Miracles of Dr. Fau-
JluS) Things as certain as Death and Taxes, cafi
be more firmly believ d : The Devil not have
a Cloven-Foot! I doubt not but I could, in a
ihort Time, bring you a thoufand old Women
together, that would as foon believe there was no
Devil at all 5 nay, they will tell
you, he could not
be a Devil without it, any more than he could
come into the Room, and the Candles not burn
blue, or go out and not leave a fmell of Brimftone
behind him.
Since then the Certainty of the Thing is fb
well eftabliih d, and there are fo many good and
fubftan-
270 The Modern HISTORY
fubftantial WitnefTes ready to teflify that he has
a Cloven-Foot, and that they have feen it too 3
nay, and that we have Antiquity on our Side, for
\ve have this Truth confirm d by the Teftimony
of many Ages 3 why fhould we doubt it
any lon
ger ? we can prove that many of our Anceflors
have been of this Opinion, and divers learn d Au
thors have left it
upon Record, as particularly
that learned Familiarift Mother Hazel^ whole
Writings are to be found in MS. in the famous Li
brary at Pye-Corner 3 alfo the admir d Joan of^mes-
bury, the Hiftory of the Lancajhire Witches,
and the Reverend Exorciil of the Devil s of Lon-
don^ whole Hiftory is extant among us to this
Day 3 all thefe and many more may be quoted, and
their Writings referred to for the Confirmation
of the Antiquity of this Truth 3 but there feems
to be no Occafion for farther Evidence, tis e-
nough, Satan himfelf, if he did not raife the Re
port, yet tacitly owns the Fact, at leaft he ap
pears willing to have it believ d, and be receiv d
as a general Truth for the Reafons above.
But beiides all this, and as much a Jeil as fome
unbelieving People would have this Story pals
for, who knows but that if Satan is
empower d
to afiume any Shape or Body, and to appear to us
viiibly, as if really fo fhap d 3 I fay, who knows
but he may, by the fame Authority, be allow d
to aiiume the Addition of the Cloven-Foot, or
two or four Cloven-Feet, if he pleafed? and why
not a Cloven-Foot as well as any other Foot, if he
thinks fit? For if the Devil can ailume a Shape,
and can appear to Mankind in a vifible Form, it
may, I doubt not, with as good Authority be ad-
vanc d that he is left at Liberty to aflame what
Shape he pleafes, and to choofc what Cafe of Flejh
and Blood he ll
pleafe to wear^ whether real or
imaginary 3 and if this Liberty be allow d him,
it
of the DEVIL. ;27I
it is an admirable Difguife for him to come gene
rally with his Cloven-Foot, that when he finds it
for his Purpofe, on fpecial Occafions to come
without it, as I faid above, he may not be iuf-
pecbed 3 but taks tins with you as you go, that all
this is
upon a Suppofition that the Devil can af-
fume a vifible Shape, and make a real
Appear
ance, which however I do not yet think fit to
grant or deny.
Certain it is, the fir ft
People who beitow d a
Cloven- Foot upon the Devil, were not fo
defpicable
as you may imagine, but were real Favourites of
Heaven &amp;gt;
for did not Aaron fet up the Devil of a
Calf in the Congregation, and fet the People a
dancing about it for a God ?
Upon which Occa-
fion, Expofitors tell us, that particular Command
was given, Levit. xvii. 7. They Jhall no more offer
their Sacrifices unto Devils, after whom they have;
gone a Whoring -,
likewife King Jeroboam fee
up
the two Calves, one at Dan and the other at Be~
the!, and we find them charg d afterwards with
fetting up the Worfhip of Devils inilead of the
Worfhip of God.
After this we find fome Nations actually facri-
ficed to the Devil in the Form of a Ram, and
others of a Goat &amp;gt;
from which, and that above
of the Calves at Horeb&amp;gt;
I doubt not the Story of
the Cloven-Foot firft derived &amp;gt;
and it is
plain that
the Worfhip of that Calf at Horeb is meant in
the Scripture quoted above, Levit. xvii. 7. Thou
Jhalt no more offer Sacrifices unto Devils : The Ori
ginal is
Seghnirim 5 that is, rough and hairy Goats
or Calves; and fome think alfo in this Shape the
Devil moft ordinarily appeared to the Egyptians
and Arabians-) from whence it was derived.
Alfo in the old Writings of the Egyptians, I
mean their hieroglyphick Writing, before the
Ufe of Letters was known, we are told this was
the
The Modern HISTORY
the Mark that he was known by \ and the Fi
gure of a Goat was the Hieroglyphick of the De
vil j fome will affirm that the Devil was particu
larly pleafed to be fo reprefented -&amp;gt;
how they came
by their Information, and whether they had it:
from his own Mouth or not. Authors have not
yet determined.
But be this as it will, I do not fee that Satan
could have been at a Lofs for fome extraordinary
Figure to have banter d Mankind with, tho this
had not been thought of -,
but thinking of the
Cloven-Foot firft, and the Matter being indifferent,
this took place, and eafily rooted it felf in the
bewildred Fancy of the People, and now tis ri
veted too fail for the Devil himfelf to remove it
if he was difpofed to try 5 but as I faid above, tis
none of his Bufinefs to folve Doubts or remove
Difficulties out of our Heads, but to perplex us
with more, as much as he can.
Some People carry this Matter a great deal
higher (till, and will have the Cloven-Foot be
like the great Stone which the Erafillan Conju
rers ufed to folve all difficult Questions upon,
after having ufed a great many monitrous and bar
barous Geitures and Distortions of their Bodies,
and cut certain Marks or magical Figures upon the
Stone $ fo, Ifay^ they will have this Cloven-Foot
be a kind of a Conjuring-Stone, and tell us, that
in former Times, when Satan drove a greater
Trade with Mankind in publick, than he has done
of late, he gave this Cloven- Foot as a Token to
his particular Favourites to work Wonders with,
and to conjure by, and that Witches, Fairies,
Hobgoblins, and fuch Things, of which the
Antients had fevcral Kinds, at leaft in their Ima
gination, had all a Goat s Leg with a Cloven-Foot
to put on upon extraordinary Occafionsj it feems
this Method is of late grown out of Pra&ice,
and
oftteDEVI L; 273
and fo like the melting of Marble and the paint
ing of Glafs, tis laid alide among the various
ufeful Arts which Hiftory tells us are loft to the
World j what may be practifed in the Fairy
World, if fuch a Place there be, we can give no
particular Account at prefent.
But neither is this all, for other wou d-be-wife
People tike upon them to make farther and
more confiderable Improvements upon this Doc
trine of the Cloven- Foot)
and treat it as a moll
fignificant Inftrument of Satan s
private Opera
tion, and that as Jofeph is faid to
Divine^
that is
to fay, to conjure by his Golden Cup which was
put into Benjamin s Sack, fo the Devil has mana
ged feveral of his fecret Operations, and Pofle-
lions, and other hellifh Mechanifms upon the Spi
rits as well as Bodies of Men, by the Medium or
Inftrumentality of the Cloven- Foot ; according
ly it had a Kind of an hellifh Infpiration in it,
and a feparate and magical Power by which he
wrought his infernal Miracles j that the Clo
ven-Foot had a fuperior Signification, and was
not only emblematic and fignificative of the Con
duct of Men, but really guided their Conduct in
the moil important Affairs of Life j and that the
Agents the Devil employ d to influence Mankind,
and to delude them and draw them into all the
Snares and Traps that he lays continually for their
Definition, were equipp d with this Foot in Aid
of their other Powers for Mifchief.
Here they read us learn d Lectures upon the
fovereign Operations which the Devil is at pre
fent Mailer of, in the Government of human
Affairs 3 and how the Cloven-Foot is an Emblem
of the true double Entendre or divided AfpecTr,
which the great Men of the World generally
act with, and by which all their Affairs are di
rected -
} from whence it comes to pafs that there is
T no
274 The Modern HISTORY
no fuch Thing as a fingle hearted Integrity, or
an upright Meaning to be found in the World 5
that Mankind, worfe than the ravenous Brutes,
preys upon his own Kind, and devours them by
all the .laudable Methods of Flattery, Whyne,
Cheat and Treachery , Crocodile like^ weeping
overthofe it will devour, deftroying thofe it fmiles
upon, and, in a Word, devours its own Kind,
which the very Beafts refufe, and that by all the
Ways of Fraud and Allurement that Hell can
invent 3 holding out a cloven divided Hoof, or
Hand, pretending to dive, when the very Pre
tence is made ufe of to enfnare and deftroy.
Thus the divided Hoof is the Representative of
a divided double Tongue, and Heart, an Emblem
of the moft exquifite Hypocrify, the mod fawn
ing and fatally deceiving Flattery &amp;gt;
and here they
give us very diverting Hiftories, tho tragical in
themfelves, of the manner which fome of the
Devil s
infpired Agents have managed themfelves
under the efpecial Influence of the Cloven- Foot -,
how they have made War under the Pretence of
Peace, murthefd Garrifons under the moll: lacred
Capitulations, maflacred innocent Multitudes af
ter Surrenders to Mercy.
Again, they tell us the Cloven-Foot has been
made ufe of in all Treafons, Plots, AlTaflinations,
and fecret as well as open Marchers and Rebel
lions. Thus Joab under the Treafon of an Em
brace, fhew d how dexteroufly he could manage
the Cloven- Foot ,
and flruck Abner under the fifth
Rib: Thus David play d the Cloven-Foot upon
poor Uriah, when he had a Mind to lie with his
Wife: Thus Brutus play d it
upon Cxfar-y and
to come nearer home, we have had a great many
retrograde Motions in this Country by this magi
cal Implement the Foot &amp;gt;
fuch as that of the Earl
of EJJexs Fate, beheading the Queen of Scots^
and
of the DEVIL. 275
and diverfe others in Queen Elizabeth s Time : That
of the Earl ofShrewsbury and Sir Thomas Over-bury^
Gondamor and Sir Walter Raleigh^ and many o-
thers in King James the I.*s Time 3 in all which,
if the Cloven-Foot had not been dexterouily ma-
nag d, thofe Murthers had not been Ib dexterouily
manag d, or the Murtherers have fo well been
skrcen d from Jufticej for which and the impre
cated Juflice of Heaven unappeafed, fome have
thought the innocent Branches of the Royal
Houfe of Stuart did not fare the better in the
Ages which follow d.
It mult be confefs d, the Cloven-Foot was in
its full Exercife in the next Reign, and the Ge
neration that role up immediately after them, ar
rived to the molt cxquiiite Skill for Management
of it 5 here they failed and pray d, there they
plundered and murther d $ here they rais d War
for the King, and there they fought againlt
him, cutting Throats for God s Sake, and depof-
ing both King and kingly Government according
to Law.
Nor was the Cloven-Foot unemployed on all
Sides, for tis the main Excellency of this Inftru-
ment of Hell, that it a6rs on every Side, it is its
denominating Quality^ and is for that Reafon
cali d a cloven or divided Hoof.
This mutilated Apparition has been fo publick
in other Countries too, that it feems to convince
us the Devil is not confin d to England only,
but that as his Empire extended to all the fub-
lunary World, fo he gives them all Room to
fee he is qualified to manage them his own
Way.
What abundant Ufedid that Prince of DiiTem-
blers, Charles V. make of this Foot ? twas by the
Help ofthis Apparition ofthe Foot that he baited his
Hook with the City QtMilan, and tickled Francis I.
T 2, of
276 Tfo Modern HISTORY
of France fo well with it, that when he pafs d
thro France^ and was in that King s Power, he
let him go, and never get the Bait off of the
Hook neither &amp;gt;
it ieems the Foot was not on King
Francis s Side at that Time.
How cruelly did Philip II. of Spain manage
this Foot in the Murther of the Nobility of the
Spanijb Netherlands^ the Aflaffination of the Prince
of Orange, and at lad in that of his own Son Don
Carlos Infant of Spain ? and yet fuch was the
Devil s Craft, and fo nicely did he beftir his C70-
ven-Hoof, that this Monarch died confolated (tho*
impenitent) in the Arms of the Church, and with
the Benedi&ion of the Clergy too, thofe fecond
left Managers of the faid Hoof in the World.
I muft
acknowledge, I
agree with this Opinion
thus far j namely, that the Devil acting by this
Cloven-Foot, as a Machine, has done great Things
in the World for the propagating his dark Em
pire among us 5 and Hiftory is full of Examples,
befides the little low priz d Things done among
us 5 for we are come to fuch a Kind of Degene
racy in Folly, that we have even difhonour d the
Devil) and put this glorious Engine the Cloven-
Foot to fuch mean Ufes, that the Devil himfelf
feems to be afham d of us.
But to return a little to foreign Hiftory, befides
what has been mention d above, we find flaming
Examples of moft glorious Mifchief done by this
Weapon, when put into the Hands of Kings and
Men of Fame in the World : How many Games
have the Kings of France play d with this Cloven-
Foot, and that within a few Years of one another?
Firft, Charles IX. play d the Cloven-Foot upon
Gafpar Collgni Admiral of France, when he ca-
refs d him, complimented him, invited him to
Paris, to the Wedding of the King of Navarre,
call d him Father, kifs d him, and when he was
wounded
of the DEVIL. 277
wounded Tent his own Surgeons to take Care of
him, and yet three Days after order d him to be
aflliifinated and murther d, ufed with a thouland
Indignities, and at laft thrown out of the Win
dow into the Street to be infulted by the Rabble?
Did not Henry III. in the fame Country, play
the Cloven-Foot upon the Duke of Guife^ when
he call d him to his Council, and caus d him to
be murther d as he went in at the Door? The
Guifes again plaid the fame Game back upon the
King, when they fent out a Jacobin Friar toafTaffi-
nate him in his Tent as he lay at the Siege of Paris.
In a Word, this Opera of the Cloven-Foot has
been acted all over the Chriftian World, ever fince
Judas betrayed the Son of God with a Kifs &amp;gt;
nay,
our Saviour fays expreily of him, One of you is a
Devil 5 and the facred Text fays in another Place,
The Devil entered into Judas.
It would take up a great deal of Time and
Paper too, to give you a full Account of the
Travels of this Cloven-Foot j
its
Progrefs into all
the Courts of Europe^ and with what mod accu
rate Hypocrify Satan has made uie of it
upon ma
ny Occafions, and with what Succefsj but as in
the elaborate Work of which I juft now gave
you a Specimen I defign one whole Volume upon
this Subject, and which I {hall call, The compleat
Hift ory of the Cloven- Foot 3 I fay,
for that Reafon,
and diverfe others, I fhall fay but very little more
to it in this Place.
It remains to tell you, that this merry Story
of the Cloven-Foot is
very eflential to the Hiftory
which I am now writing, as it has been all along
the great Emblem of the Devil s Government in
the World, and by which all his mofl confiderable
Engagements have been anfwer d and executed j
for as he is faid not to be able to conceal this
Fqot?
but that he carries it
always with him, it
T 3 imports
27 S The Modern HISTORY
imports moft plainly, that the Devil would be no
Devil if he was not a DifTembler, a Deceiver, and
carried a double Entendre in all he does or fays 3 that
he cannot but fay one Thing and mean another,
promife one Thing and do another, engage and
not perform, declare and not intend, and act like
a true Devil as he is,,
with a Countenance that is
no Index of his Heart.
I might indeed go back to Originals, and de
rive this Cloven- Foot from Satan s
primitive State
as a Cherubim or a celeftial Being, which Chc-
rubims, as Mofes is faid to have (een them about
the Throne of God in Mount Sinai, and as the
fame Mofes, from the Original reprefented them
afterwards covering the Ark, had the Head and
Face of a Man, Wings of an Eagle, Body of a
Lion, and Legs and Feet of a Calfj but this is not
ib much to our prefent Purpofe, for as we are to
allow that whatever Satan had of heavenly Beau
ty before the Fall, he loft it all when he com-
menc d Devil, fo to fetch his Original fo far up
would be only to fay, that he retained nothing but
the Cloven-Foot, and that all the reft of him was
alter d and deform d, become frightful and horri
ble as the DEVIL 5 but his Cloven-Foot, as we
now underftand it, is rather myftical and emble-
matick, and defcribes him only as the Fountain
of Mifchief and Treafon, and the Prince of Hy
pocrites, and as fuch we are now to fpeak of
him.
Tis from this Original all the hypocritic World
copy, he wears the Foot on their Account, and
from this Model they at : This made our bleffed
Lord tell
them, the Works of your Father ye will
do, meaning the Devil, as he had exprefs d it
juft
before.
Nor does he deny the Ufe of the Foot to the
meaner Clafs of his Difciples in the World, but
decently
of the DEVI L. 279
decently equips them all
upon every Occafion
with a needful Proportion of Hypocrify and De
ceit -,
that they may hand on the Power of pro-
mifcuous Fraud thro all his temporal Dominions,
and wear the Foot always about them as a Badge
of their profefs d Share in whatever is done by
that Means.
Thus every Diflembler, every falfe Friend, every
fecret Cheat, every Bearskin-Jobber has a Clo-
wen-Foot^ and fo far hands on the Devil s Intereft
by the lame powerful Agency of Art, as the
Devil bimfelf ufes to aft when he appears in Per-
fon, or would aft if he was juft now upon the
Spot 5 for this Foot is a Machine which is to be
wound up and wound down, as the Catife it
ap
pears for requires
-
y and there are Agents and En
gineers to aft in it
by Directions of Satan (the
grand Engineer) who lies ftill in his Retirement,
only ifTuing out his Orders as he fees convenient.
Again, every Clafs, every Trade, every Shop
keeper, every Pedlar, nay, that meaneft ofTradcf-
men, that Church Pedlar the Pope, has a Cloven-
Foot, with which he Paw w^s upon the World,
wiihes them all well, and at the lame time cheats
them y wifhes them all fed, and at the fame time
itarves them j wiihes them all in Heaven, and at
the fame time marches before them direftly to
the Devil, alamode de Cloven-Foot.
Nay, the very Bench, the everliving Foun
dation of Juflice in the World -
y how often has it
been made the Tool of Violence, the Refuge of
Oppreffion, the Seat of Bribery and Corruption, by
this Moniler in Mafquerade, and that every where
(our own Country always excepted) ?
They had
much better wipe out the Picture ofjudice blinded,
and having the Sword and Scales in her Hand,
which in foreign Countries is
generally painted over
the Seat of thafc who fit to do Jullicc, and place
T 4 inilead
280 The Modern HISTORY
initead thereof a naked unarm d Cloven- Hoof, a
proper Emblem of that Spirit that Influences the
World, and of the Juftice we often fee admini-
ftred among them 3 human Imagination cannot
form an Idea more fuitable, nor the Devil pro-
pofe an Engine more or better qualified for an O-
peration ofJuftice,by the Influence of Bribery and
Corruption &amp;gt;
it is this
magnipotent Inflrument in
the Hands of the Devil, which under the clofeft
Difguife agitates every Paffion, bribes every Af
fection, blackens every Virtue, gives a double
Face to Words and Aftions, and to all Perfons
who have any Concern in them, and in a Word,
makes us all Devils to one another.
Indeed the Devil has taken but a dark Emblem
to be diftinguifh d by, for this of a Goat wasfaid
to be a Creature hated by Mankind from the begin
ning, and that there is a natural Antipathy in
Mankind againft them: Hence the Scape Goat
was to bear the Sins of the People, and to go
into the Wildernefs with all that Burthen upon
him.
But we have a Saying among us, in Defence
of which wemuffc enquire into the -proper Sphere
of Action which may be afTigned to this Cloven-
Foot, as hitherto defcribed : The Proverb is this;
Every Devil has not a Cloven-Foot. This Pro
verb, inilead of giving us fome more favourable
Thoughts of the Devil, confirms what I have
faid already, that the Devil rais d this Scandal up
on himfelfj I mean, the Report that he cannot
conceal or difguife his Devil s Foot, or Hoof,
but that it muft appear, under whatever Habit
he fhews himfelfj and the Reafon I
gave holds
good flill, namely^ that he may be more effeflu-
ally conceal d when he goes abroad without it :
For if the People were fully perfuaded that the
Devil could not appear without this Badge of
4 his
of the DEVIL;
his Honour, or Mark of his Infamy, take it as you
will -
y and that he was bound alfo to ihew it
up
on all Occafions, it would be natural to con
clude, that whatever frightful Appearances might
be feen in the World, if the Cloven-Foot did
not alfo appear, we had no Occafion to look for
the Devi^ or fo much as to think of him, much
lefs to apprehend he was near us &amp;gt;
and as this
might
be a Miftake, and that the Devil might be there
while we thought our felves fo fecure, it
might
on many Occalions be a Miftake of very ill Con-
fequence, and in particular, as it would give the
Devil room to a6b in the Dark, and not be di
cover d, where it
might be moft needful to know
him.
From this fhort Hint, thus repeated, I draw
a new Thefis, namely, That Devil is moft dan
gerous that has no Cloven-Foot 5 or, if you will
have it in Words more to the common Under-
ftanding, the Devil feems to be moft dangerous
when he goes without his Cloven- Foot.
And here a learned Speculation offers it felf to
our Debate, and which indeed I ought to call a
Council of Cafuifts, and Men learned in the De
vil s Politicks, to determine :
Whether is moft hurtful to the World, the
Devil walking about without his Cloven-Foot, or
the Cloven-Foot walking about without the De*
vil?
It is indeed a nice and difficult Queftion, and
merits to be well enquir d into 3 for which Rea-
fon, and diverfe others, I have referr d it to be
treated with fome Decency, and as a Difptite of
Pignity fufficient to take up a Chapter by itfelf.
CHAP.
282 The Modern HISTORY
CHAP. VII.
Whether is moft hurtful to the World, the
Devil walking about without his Cloven-
Foot , or the Cloven-Foot walking about
without the Devil ?
IN
difcuffing this moft critical Diflin&ion of
Satan s
private Motions , I mull, as the Pul
pit Gentlemen dire6t us, explain the Text, and let
you know what I mean by feveral dark Exprefli-
ons in it, that I may not be underflood to talk
(as the Devil walks) in the dark.
i. As to the Devil s
walking about.
2,. His walking without his Cloven-Foot.
3. The Cloven-Foot walking about without
the Devil.
Now as I ftudy Brevity, and yet would be un^
derftood too, you may pleafe to underftand me as
I underftand my felf, thus.
I. That I muft be allow d to fuppofe the
Devil really has a full Intercourfe in, and
through, and about this Globe, with Egrels
and Regrefs, for the carrying on his fpe-
cial Affairs, when, how, and where, to his
Majefty, in his great Wifdom, it lhall feem
iheet y that fometimes he appears and be
comes vifible, and that, like a Maftiff with-?
out his Clog, he does not always carry his
Cloven-Foot with him. This will neceffo-
rily bring me to fome Debate upon the moft
important Queftion of Apparitions,
Haunt-
ings, Walkings, &c. whether of Satan in
human
EVl L. 28 j
human Shape, or of human Creatures in the
Devil s
Shape, or in any other manner what-
ibever.
2, I mutt alfo be allow d to tell
you that
Satan has a great deal of Wrong done him
by the general embracing vulgar Errors, and
that there is a Cloven-Foot oftentimes with
out a Devil; or, in fhort, that Satan is not
guilty of all the fimple Things, no, or of
all the wicked Things we charge him with.
Thefe two Heads well fettled will fully explain
the Title of this Chapter, anfwer the Query men
tioned in it, and at the fame time
correspond
ve
ry well with, and give us a farther ProfpecT: into
the main and original Defign of this Work,
namely^ the Hiftory of the Devil. We are fo
fond of, and pleafed with the general Notion of
feeing the Devil^ that I am loth to difoblige my
Readers fo much as calling in queftion his Vifi-
bility would do. Nor is it
my Bufinefs, any
more than it is his, to undeceive them, where
the Belief is fo agreeable to them; efpecially fince
upon the whole tis not one Farthing matter, ei
ther on one Side or on the other, whether &quot;it be
fo or no, or whether the Truth of Fact be ever
difcovcred or not.
Certain it is, whether we fee him or no, here
he is, and I make no doubt but he is
looking on
while I am writing this Part of his Story, whe
ther behind me, or at
my Elbow, or over my
Shoulder, is not material to me, nor have I once
turned my Head about to lee whether he is there
or no &amp;gt;
for if he be not in, the Infide, I have fo
mean an Opinion of all his extravafated Powers,
that it feems of very little Confequence to me
what Shape he takes up, or in what Pofture he
appears 5 nor indeed can I find in all
my Enquiry
that
284 The Modern HISTORY
that ever the Devil appeared (Qua Devil} in any
of the mod dangerous or important of his De-
figns in the World &amp;gt;
the moft of his Projects,
efpecially
of the fignificant Part of them, having
been carried on another way.
However, as I am fatisfied no Body will be
pleas
d if I fhould difpute the Reality of his Ap
pearance, and the World runs away with it as a
receiv d Point, and that admits no Difpute, I
fhall moft readily grant the General, and give
you fome Account of the Particulars.
Hiftory is fruitful of Particulars, whether In
vention has fupply d them or not&amp;gt;
I will not fay,
where the Devil is
brought upon the Stage in
plain and undeniable Apparition : The Story of
Samuel being rais d by the Witch of Endor^ I
fhall leave quite out of my Lift, becaufe there
are fo many Scruples and Objections againft that
Story 3 and as I fhall not difpute with the Scrip
ture, fo on the other hand, I have fo much De
ference for the Dignity of the Devil^ as not to
determine rafhly how far it
may be in the Power
of every old (Witch} Woman, to call him up
whenever fhe pleafes, and that he mud come,
whatever the Pretence is, or whatever Bufinefs
of Confequence he may be engaged in, as often
as tis needful for her to Pa &amp;lt;wa for half a Crown,
or perhaps lefs than half the Money.
Nor will I undertake to tell
you, till I have
talk d farther with him about it, how far the
Devil is concerned to difcover Frauds, detect
Murthers, reveal Secrets, and efpecially to tell
where any Money is hid, and fhew Folks where
to find it ; tis an odd thing that Satan fhould
think it ofConfequence to come and tell us where
fuch a Mifcr hid a Strong Box, or where fuch
an old Woman buried her Chamber Pot full of
Money, the Value of all which is perhaps but a
Trifle,
of the DEVIL. 2*5
Trifle, when at the fame time he lets fo many
Veins of Gold, fo many unexhaufled Mines, nay,
Mountains of Silver, as, we may depend upon
it, are hid in the Bowels of the Earth, and which
it would be fo much to the Good of whole Na
tions to difcover, lie flill there, and never fay one
Word of them to any Body. Befides, how
does the Devil s
doing Things fo foreign to him-
felf, and fo out of his way, agree with the reft
of his Character ; namely, {hewing a kind of a
friendly Difpofition to Mankind, or doing bene
ficent Things ? This is fo beneath Satan s Quali
ty, and looks fo little, that I fcarce know what
to fay to it j but that which is ftill more pun
gent in the Cafe is, thefe Things are fo out of
his Road, and fo foreign to his
Calling, that it
{hocks our Faith in them, and feems to claih
with all the juft Notions we have of him, and
of his Bufinefs in the World. The like is to
be faid of thofe little merry Turns we bring him
in acting with us, and upon us, upon trifling and
fimple Occafions, fuch as tumbling Chairs and
Stools about Houfe, fetting Pots and Veilels Bot
tom upward, tofling the Glafs and Crokery
Ware about without breaking ^ and fuch like mean
foolifli Things, beneath the Dignity of the De-
i/
/V, who, in
my Opinion, is rather employ d in
letting the World with the Bottom upward,
tumbling Kings and Crowns about, and dafhing
the Nations one againft another j raifing Tern-
pelts and Storms, whether at Sea, or on Shore 5
and, in a word, doing capital Mifchiefs fuitablc
to his Nature, and agreeable to his Name, Devil;
and fuited to that Circumftance of his Condition,
which I have fully reprefented in the primitive
Part of his exil d State.
But to bring in the Devil playing at Pufh-pin
with the World, or like Dvmitian catching Flies,
that
186 The Modern HISTORY
that is to fay, doing nothing to the purpofe 5 this
is not only deluding our felves, but putting a
Slur upon the Devil himfelf$ and, I fay, I fhall
not dishonour Satan fo much as to fuppofe any
thing in it :
However, as I mufl have a care too
how I take away the proper Materials of Winter
Evening Frippery, and leave the good Wives
nothing of the Devil to fright the Children witfy
I fhall carry the weighty Point no farther. No
doubt the Devil and Dr. Fauftus were very inti
mate j I fhould rob you of a very fignificant
*
Proverb, if I fhould fo much as doubt it j no
doubt the Devil fhew d himfelf in the Glafs to
that fair Lady who look d in it to fee where to
place her Patches j but then it ihould follow too
that the Devil is an Enemy to the Ladies wear
ing Patches, and that has fome Difficulties in it
which we cannot fo eafily reconcile &amp;gt;
but we mull
tell the Story, and leave out the Confequenccs.
But to come to nifere remarkable Things, and
in which the Devil has thought fit to ac~b in a
Figure more fuitable to his
Dignityj
and on Oc-
cafions confiftent with himfelf &amp;gt;
take the Story
of the Appearance of Julius C*/ar, or the Devil
afluming that murthered Emperor^ to the great
Marcus Brutus^ who notwithflanding all the good
Things faid to juftify it, was no lefs than a King-
killer and an Aflaffinator, which we in our Lan
guage call by a very good Name, and peculiar
to the Englijh Tongue, a Ruffian.
The Spe6fcre had certainly the Appearance of
C&amp;lt;efar^
with his Wounds bleeding freih, as if
he had juft received the fatal Blow &amp;gt;
he had re-
proach d him with his Ingratitude, with a 70
Brute! tu quoque, mi fill:
&quot;
What Thou Brutus!
* As great as the Devil and Doftsr Fauftus. Vulg- Dr. Fofter.
Thou?
of the D E V i L.
&quot;
Thou, my adopted Son !
&quot;
Now Hiftory feems
to agree univerfally, not only in the Story itfelf,
but in the Circumfiances of it
-
y we have only to
obferve that the Devil had certainly Power to
aflame, not a human Shape only, but the Shape
of Julius Ctffar in particular.
Had Brutus been a timorous Confcience-harry ^
weak-headed Wretch, had he been under the
Horror of the Gailt, and terrify d with the Dan
gers that were before him at that time, we might
fuggeft that he was over-run with the Vapours,
that the Terrors which were upon his Mind dif-
order d him, that his Head was delirious and pre-
pofTefs d, and that his Fancy only plac d Cafar
ib continually in his Eye, that it realiz d him to
his Imagination, and he bcliev d he faw him ;
with many other fuggefted Difficulties to inva
lidate the Story, and render the Reality of it
doubtful.
But the contrary, to an Extreme, was the Cafe
of Brutus ; his known Character plac d him a-
bove the Power of all
Hypocondriacks, or fan
ciful Delufions ; Brutus was of a true Roman
Spirit, a bold Hero, of an intrepid Courage ;
one that fcorn d to fear even the Devil, as the
Story allows :
Befides, he glory d in the Action &amp;gt;
there cou d be no Terror of Mind upon him &amp;gt;
he
valued himfelf upon it, as done in the Service of
Liberty, and the Caufe of his Country 5 and was
fo far from being frighted at the Devil in the
worfl Shape, that he ipoke fir ft to him, and ask d
him, What art thou ? and when he was cited to
fee him again at Philippi^ aniwer d, with a Gal
lantry that knew no Fear, well I willfee thee there.
Whatever |Se Devil s Bufinefs was with Brutus,
this is certain, according to all the Hiftorians
who give us the Account of it, that Brutus dif-
covcr d no Fear ; he did not, like Saul at Endor^
fall
288 The Modern HISTORY
fall to the Ground in a Swoon, i Sam. xxviii. lo.
Then Saul fell all along upon the Earth, and there
&amp;lt;was no Strength in him, and was fore afraid. In
a word, I fee no room to charge Brutus with be
ing over-run with the Hyppo, or with Vapours,
or with Fright and Terror of Mind j but he faw
the Devil, that s certain, and with Eyes open, his
Courage not at all daunted, his Mind refolute,
and with the utmoft Compofure fpoke to him,
reply d to his Anfwer, and defy d his Summons
to Death, which indeed he feafd not, as
appeared
afterward.
I come next to an Inftance as eminent in Hif-
tory as the other -,
this was in Char. VI. of France^
firnamed, The Beloved; who riding over the Fo-
reil near Mans, a ghaftly frightful Fellow ( that
is to fay, the Devil fo clothed in human Vizor)
came up to his Horfe, and taking hold of his
Bridle, ftop d him, with the Addition of thefe
Words, Stop King) whither go you ? Tou are be-
trafd! and immediately difappear d. It is true,
the King had been diftemper d in his Head be
fore, and fo he might have been deceived, and
we might have charg d it to the Account of a
whimfical Brain, or the Power of his Imagina
tion 5 but this was in the Face of his Attendants,
feveral of his great Officers, Courtiers, and Prin
ces of the Blood being with him, who all law
the Man, heard the Words, and immediately, to
their Aftonifhment, loft Sight of the Spe&re, who
vanifli d from them all.
Two Witnefles will convict a Murtherer, why
not a Traitor? This muft be the Old Gentleman,
emblematically fo called, or who muft it be? nay,
who elfe could it be? His Uglinefs is not the
Cafe, tho ugly as the Devil, is a Proverb in his
Favour j but vanifhing out of fight is an Effen-
tial to a
Spirit, and to an evil Spirit in our Times
cfpecially.
Thefe
of the DEVILS
Thefe are fome of the Devil s Extraordinaries,
and it muft be confefs d they are not the moil
agreeable to Mankind, for fometimes he takes
upon him to diforder his Friends very much on
thefe Occafions^ as in the above Cafe of Cha. VI.
of France 5 the King, they fay, was really de
mented ever after 5 that is, as we vulgarly, but
not always improperly, exprefs it, he was really
frighted out of his Wits. Whether the malicious
Devil intended it fo, or not, is not certain, tho
it was not fo foreign to his particular Difpofition
if -he did.
But where he is more intimate, we are told he
appears in a manner lefs
difagreeable3 and there
he is more properly a familiar Spirit -,
that is, in
fhort, a Devil of their Acquaintance : It is
true,
the Antients underftand the Word, a familiar
Spirit, to be one of the kinds of PolTeffion j but
if it ferves our turn as well under the Denomina
tion of an intimate Devil^ or a Devil vifitant,
it muft be acknowledg d to be as near in the li
teral Senfe and Acceptation of the Word, as the
others nay, it muft be allow d tis a very great
Piece of Familiarity in the Devil to make Vifits$
and fhew none of his Difagreeables, not appear
formidable, or in the Shape of what he is, re-
fpetfully withholding his difmal Part, in Com-
paflion to the Infirmities of his Friends.
It is true, Satan may be obliged to make dif
ferent Appearances, as the feveral Circumfiances
of Things call for it 5 in fome Cafes he makes
his publick Entry, and then he muft {hew him-
felf in his Habit of Ceremony ; in other Cafes
he comes upon private Bufinefs, and then he ap
pears in Difguife \ in fome publick Cafes he may
thing fit to be incog, and then he appears drefs d
a la Mafque j fo they fay he appeared at the fa
mous St. Bartholomew Wedding at Paris^ where
U he&quot;
290 The Modern HISTORY
he came in drefs d up like a Trumpeter, danc d
in his Habit, founded a Levet, and then went out
and rung the Alarm-Bell (
which was the Signal
to begin the Maflacre) half an Hour before the
Time appointed, left the King s Mind ihould al
ter, and his Heart fail him.
If the Story be not made upon him, (
for we
fhould not flander the Devil) it fhould feem, he
was not thoroughly fatisfied in King Charles IX. s
Steadinefs in his Caufe 5 for the King, it feems,
hadrelax d a little once before, and Satan might be
afraid he would fall off again, and fo prevent the
Execution: Others fay, the King did relent im
mediately after the ringing the Alarm-Bell, but
that then it was too late, the Work was begun,
and the Rage of Blood having been let loofe a-
mong the People, there was no recalling the Or
der. If the Devil was thus brought to the Ne-
ceflhy of a fecret Management, it muil be owned
he did it
dexteroufly &amp;gt;
but I have not Authority
enough for the Story, to charge him with the
Particulars, fo I leave it au croc.
I have much better Vouchers for the Story
following, which I had fo folemnly confirm d by
one that liv d in the Family, that I never doubt
ed the Truth of it. There liv d, in the .Parifh
of St. Bennet Fynk, near the Royal Exchange, an
honeft poor Widow Woman, who, her Husband
leing lately dead, took Lodgers into her Houfe&amp;gt;
that is, fhe let out fome of her Rooms in order
to leflen her own Charge of Rent &amp;gt;
among the
reft, fhe let her Garrets to a working Watch-
wheel-maker, or one fome way concern d in
making the Movements of Watches, and who
work dto thofe Shop-keepers who fell Watches j
as is ufual.
It happened that a Man and Woman went up,
to fpeak with this Movement-maker upon fome
Bufinefs
of the DEVIL. 291
Bufinefs which related to his Trade, and when
they were near the Top of the Stairs, the Garret-
Door where he ufually worked being wide open,
they faw the poor Man (
the Watch-maker, or
Wheel-maker) had hang d himfelf upon a Beam
which was left
open in the Room a little lower
than the Plaifler, or Ceiling :
Suypriz d at the
Sight, the Woman flop d, and cried out to the
Man who was behind her on the Stairs that he
ihould run up, and cut the poor Creature down.
At that very Moment comes a Man haflily
from another Part of the Room which they
upon the Stairs could not fee, bringing a Joint-
Stool in his Hand, as if in great Hafle, and fets
it down jufl by the Wretch that was hang d,
and getting up as haflily upon it
pulls a Knife
out of his Pocket, and taking hold of the Rope
with one of his Hands, beckon d to the Woman
and the Man behind her with his Head, as if to
flop and not come up, fhewing them the Knife
in his other Hand, as if he was jufl going to cue
the poor Man down.
Upon this, the Woman flopp d a while, but
the Man who flood on the Joint-Stool continued
with his Hand and Knife as if fumbling at the
Knot, but did not yet cut the Man down &amp;gt;
at
which the Woman cried out again, and the Man
behind her call d to her, Go up, fays he^ and help
the Man upon the Stool !
fuppofing fomething
hindred. But the Man upon the Stool made Signs
to them again to be quiet, and not come on, as
if faying, I {hall do it immediately &amp;gt;
then he
made two Strokes with his Knife, as if cutting
the Rope, and then flopped again ; and flill the
poor Man was hanging, and confequently dying :
Upon this, the Woman on the Stairs cried out
to him, What ails
you ?
Why don t you cut the
poor Man down? And the Man behind her,
U 2.
having
The Modern HISTORY
having no more Patience, thrufts her by, and faid
to her, Let me come, I ll warrant you I ll do it 5
and with that runs up and forward into the Room
to the Man 5 but when he came there, behold,
the poor Man was there hanging ; but no Man
with a Knife, or Joint-Stool, or any fuch thing
to be fecn, all that was Spectre and Delufion, in
order, no doubt, to let the poor Creature that
had hang d himfelf periih and expire.
The Man was fo frighted and furpriz d, that
with all the Courage he had before, he drop d on
the Floor as one dead, and the Woman at laft
was fain to cut the poor Man down with a Pair
of Sciflars, and had much to do to effecl: it.
As I have no room to doubt the Truth of this
Story, which I had from Perfons on whofe Ho-
nefty I could depend, fo I think it needs very
little Trouble to convince us who the Man upon
the Stool mufl be, and that it was the Devil who
plac d himfelf there in order to finiih the Mur-
ther of the Man who he had, .D^v/Mike, tempt
ed before, and prevail d with to be his own Ex
ecutioner. Befides, it correfponds fo well with
the Devil s Nature, and with his Bufinefs, viz.
that of a Murtherer^ that I never queftion d it&amp;gt;
nor can I think we wrong the Devil at all to
charge him with it.
N. B. I cannot be pofitive in the remaining
Part of this Story, viz. whether the Man
was cut down foon enough to be recover d,
or whether the Devil carry d his Point, and
kept off the Man and Woman till it was
too late 5 but be it which it will, tis
plain
he did his Devilifh Endeavour, and ftay d till
he was forc d to abfcond again.
We have many folid Tales well attefted, as

pie, who could not be deceived, intimating the
Devtfs perfonal Appearance, fome in one Place*
fome in another j as alfo fometimes in one Habit
or Drefs, and fometimes in another &amp;gt;
and it is to
be obferved, that in none of thofe which are moil
like to be real, and in which there is leaft of
Fancy and Vapour, you have any Mention of
the Cloven Foot, which rather feems to be a mere
Invention of Men (and perhaps chiefly of thofe
who had a Cloven Underftandingl I mean a {fol
low kind of Craft, the Effect of an empty and
fimple Head, thinking by fuch a well-meant, tho
weak Fraud, to reprefent the Devil to the old
Women and Children of the Age, with fome
Addition fuitable to the Wcaknefs of their Intel
lects, and fuited to making them afraid of him.
I have another Account of a Peri on who tra-
vell d upwards of four Years with the Devil in
his Company, and conversed moft intimately with
him all the while -,
nay, if I may believe the
Story, he knew moft part of the Time that he
was the Devil^ and yet conversed with him, and
that very profitably, for he perform d many very
ufeful Services for him, and conftantly preferv d
him from the Danger of Wolves and wild Reafts,
which the Country he travell d thro was intole^
rably full of. Where, by the way, you are to un-r
derftand, that the Wolves and Bears in thofe
Countries knew the Devil, whatever Difguife he
went in -
y or that the Devil has fome Way to
fright Bears and fuch Creatures, more than we
know of. Nor could this Devil ever be prevail d
upon to hurt him or any of his Company. This
Account has an innumerable Number of divert
ing Incidents attending it ; but they are equal to
all the reft in Bulk, and therefore top long for
fhis Book.
U J
I End
294- The Modern HISTORY
I find too upon fome mofe ordinary Occafl-
ons the Devil has appear d to feveral People at
their Call : This indeed {hews abundance of good
Humour in him, confidering him as a Devil^ and
that he was mighty compliafant :
Nay fome, they
tell u?, have a Power to raife the Devil when
ever they think fit 3 this I cannot bring the De
vil to a Level with, unlefs I fhould allow him to
be Servus Servorum, as another Devil in Difguife
calls himfelf ; fubjected to ever old Wizard s
Call 3 or that he is under a NecerTity of appear
ing on fuch or fuch particular Occafions, who
ever it is that calls him 5 which would bring the
Devil s Circumftances to a pitch of Slavery which
I fee no Reafon to believe of them.
Here alfo I muft take Notice again, that tho*
I fay the Devil^ when I fpeak of all thefe Appa
ritions, whether of a greater or lefler Kind, yet
I am not oblig d to fuppofe Satan himfelf in Per-
fon is concerned to {hew himfelf, but that fome
of his Agents^ Deputies and Servants, are lent to
that Purpofe, and direfted what Difguife of Flefh
and Blood to put on, as may be fuitable to the
Occafion.
This feems to be the only Way to reconcile all
thofe fimple and ridiculous Appearances which
not Satcin^ but his Emiflaries, (
which we old
Women call Imps) fometimes make, and the
mean and forry Employment they are put to:
Thus Fame tells us of a certain Witch of Qua
lity, who calFd the Devil once to carry her over
a Brook where the Water was fwelPd with a
hafly Rain, and lafh d him foundly with her
Whip for
letting her Ladyfhip fall into the Wa
ter before ihe was quite over. Thus alfo, as
Fame tells us, fhe fet the Devil to work, and
made him build Croivland Abbey, where there
was no Foundation to be found, only for dif-
turbing
of the DEVIL. 295
turbing the Workmen a little who were firft fee
about it. So it fcems another laborious Devil
was oblig d to dig the great Ditch croft the Coun
try from the Fenn Country to the Edge of Suf
folk and Effex &amp;gt;
which who ever he has preferv d
the Reputation of, and where it crofles New-
Market Heath, tis call d Devil s Ditch to this
Day.
Another Piece of Punifhment no doubt it was,
when the Devil was oblig d to bring the Stones
out of Wales into Wiltfoire, to build Stone-heng ;
How this was ordered in thofe Days, when it
Teems they kept Satan to hard Labour, I know
not y I believe it muft be regiftred among the an-
tient Pieces of Art which are loft in the World,
fuch as melting of Stone, painting of Glafs, &V.
Certainly they had the Devil under Correction
in thofe Days &amp;gt;
that is to fay, thofe lefler Sorts
of Devils y but I cannot think that the muckle
fhief Devil, as they call him in the North, the
Grand Seignior Devil of all, was ever reduced to
Difcipline. What Devil it was that Dunftan
took by the Nofe with his red hot Tongs, I have
not yet examin d Antiquity enough to be certain
of, any more than I can what Devil it was that
St. Francis play d fo many warm Tricks with,
and made him run away from him fo often : How
ever, this I take upon me to fay, in the Devil s
Behalf, that it cou d not be our Satan, the Arch
Devil of all Devils, of whom I have been talk*
ing fo long.
Now is it unworthy the Occafion, to take no
tice that we really wrong the Devil, and fpeak
of him very much to his Difadvanrage, when we
fay of fuch a Great Lord, or of fuch a Lady of
Quality, / think the Devil is in your Grace : No,
no, Satan has other Bufinefs, he very rarely pof-
feifes F Is ; Befides, fome are fo far from hav-
U 4 ing
396 The Modern HISTORY
ing the Devil in them, that they are really tranft
migrated into the very EfTence of the Devil them-
felves 3 and others again not tranfmigrated, or af-
fimilated, but Indeed and in Truth {hew us that
they are to have mere native Devils in every Part
and Parcel of them, and that the reft is
only
Mafque and Difguife. Thus if Rage, Envy%
Pride and Revenge can conftitute the Parts of a
Devi^ why {hould not a Lady of fuch Quality,
in whom all thofe Extraordinaries abound, have
a Right to the Title of being a Devil really anc^
fubftantially, and to all Intents and Purpofes, in
the moft perfect and abfolute Senfe, according to
the moft exquifite Defcriptions of Devils already
fiven
by me or any Body elfe $ and even juft as
oan of Arc, or Joan Queen of Naples were,
who were both fent home to their native Coun
try, as foon as it was difcovered that they were
real Devils, and that Satan acknowledged them in
that Quality.
Nor does my Lady D fs s
wearing fome-
times a Cafe of Humanity about her, call d Flejb.
and Blood, at all alter the Cafe 5 forfo tis Evi
dent, according to our prefent Hypothefis, Satan.
has been always allow d to do, upon urgent
Occafions -
y ay, and to make his Perfonal Appear
ance as fuch, among even the Sons and Daugh
ters of God too, as well as among the Children
of Men 5 and therefore her Grace may have ap
peared in the Shape ofa fine Lady, as long as {he
has been fuppos d to do, without any Impeach
ment of her juft Claim to the Title of Devil j
which being her true and natural Original, ihe
ought not, nor indeed {hall not, by me, be de
nied her Shapes of Honour, whenever {he pleafes
to declare for a Re-afTumption.
And farther, to give every Truth its due II-
luftration,, this need not he thought fo ftrange $

and is far from being unjuft ; her Grace (as {he,
it may be, is now ftiled) has not afted, at leaft
that I never heard of, fo unworthy her great and
illuftrious Original, that we fhould think ihe has
loft any thing by walking about the World fo
many Years in Apparition : But to give her the
due Homage of her Quality, fhe has afted as
confonant to the Eflence and Nature of Devil^
which fhe has fuch a Claim to, as was confident
with the needful Referve of her prefent Difguife.
Nor fhall we lead the Reader into any Miftake
concerning this part of our Work, as if this was
or is meant to be a particular Satyr upon the
D fs of --, and upon her only,
as if we had no DEVILS among us in the Pheno
mena of fair Ladies, but this one : If Satan
would be fo honed to us as he might be (and
twou d be very ingenuous in him, that muft be
acknowledg d, to give us a little of his Illumi
nation in this Cafe) we fhould foon be able to
unmafque a great many notable Figures among us,
to our real Surprize.
Indeed tis a Point worth our further Enquiry,
and would be a Difcovery many ways to our Ad
vantage, were we blefs d with it, to fee how ma
ny real Devils we have walking up and down the
World in Mafque, and how many Hoop-Petti
coats compleat the entire Mafque that dilguifes
the Devil in the Shape of that Thing call d Wo
man.
As for the Men, Nature has fatisfied her felf
in letting them be their own Difguife, and in
fuffering them to a6b the old Women^ as old
Women are vulgarly underftood, in Matters of
Council and Politicks ; but if at any time they
have Occafion for the Devil in Pcrfon, they arc
oblig d to call him to their Aid in fuch Shape
$s he pleafcs to make ufe of fro hac vice 3 and of
all
29S The ModernUlS TORY
all thofe Shapes, the moft agreeable to him feems
to be that of a Female of Quality, in which he
has infinite Opportunity to aft to Perfection,
what Part foever he is call d in for.
How happy are thofe People who they fay have
the particular Quality, or acquir d Habit., call d
the Second Sight 3 one Sort of whom they tell us
are able to diftinguifh the Devil, in whatever
Cafe or Outfide of Flefh and Blood he is
pleas d
to put on, and confequently could know the De
vil wherever they met him ? Were I bleft with
this excellent and ufeful Accomplishment, how
pleafant would it be, and how would it
particu
larly gratify my Spleen, and all that which I, in
common with my fellow Creatures carry about
me, call d 111- Nature, to ftarid in the Mall, or at
the Entrance to any of our Affemblies of Beau
ties, dnd point them out as they pais by, with
this particular Mark, That s a Devil; that fine
young Toaft is a Devil j There s a Devil dreft in
a new Habit for the Ball -,
There s a Devil in a
Coach and Six, cum aliis. In fhort, it would
make a merry World among us if we coul d but
enter upon fome proper Method of fuch Difcri-
minations :
but, Lawr^d, what a Hurricane would
it raife, if, like-- , who they fay fcourg d
the Devil fo often that he durft not come near
him in any Shape whatever, we cou d find fome
new Method out to make the Devil unmask, like
the Angel Uriel, who, Mr. Milton fays, had an
enchanted Spear, with which if he did but touch
the Devil, in whatever Difguife he had put on,
it
oblig d him immediately to ftart up, and {hew
himfelf in his true original Shape, mere Devil as
he was.
This would do nicely, and as I who am ori
ginally a Projector, have fpent fome Time upon
this Study, and doubt not in a little Time to fi
nal*
of the &quot;DEVI L; 299
nifh my Engine, which I am contriving, to fcrew
the Devil out of every Body, or any Body j I
queftion not when I have brought it to Perfec
tion, but I fhall make moft excellent Difcoveries
by it y and befides the many extraordinary Advan
tages of it to human Society, I doubt not but it
will make good Sport in the World too j where
fore, when I publifh my Propofals, and divide it
into Shares, as other lefs ufeful Projects have been
done, I
queftion not, for all the fevere Act lately
pafs d againft Bubbles, but I fhall get Subfcribers
enough, &c.
In a Word, a fecret Power of difcovering what
Devils we have among us, and where and what
Bufinefs they are doing, would be a vaft Advan
tage to us all 3 that we might know among the
Crowd of Devils that walk about Streets, who
are Apparitions, and who are not.
Now I, you muft know, at certain Intervals
when the Old Gentleman s Illuminations are up
on me, and when I have foraething of an Eclari-
ciffement with him, have fome Degrees of this
difcriminating Second Sight, and therefore tis no
ftrange thing for me to tell a great many of my
Acquaintance that they are really Devils, when
they themfelves know nothing of the Matter :
Sometimes indeed 1 find it
pretty hard to convince
them of it, or at leaft they are very unwilling to
own it, but it is not the lefs fo for that.
I had a long Difcourfeupon this Subject one day,
with a young beautiful Lady of my Acquiantance,
who the World very much admired 5
and as the
World judges no farther than they can fee, (and
how fhould they, you would fay) they took her
to be, as flie really was, a moft charming Crea
ture.
To me indeed {he difcover d her felf many Ways,
befides the Advantage I had of my extraordinary
Penetra*
300 The Modern HISTORY
Penetration by the magic Powers which I am
veiled with : To me, Ifay9 fhe appeared a Fury, a
Satyr, a fiery little Fiend as could poflibly be drefs d
up in Flefh j in fhort, fhe appear d to me what
really fhe was, a very DEVIL : It is natural to hu
man Creatures to defire to difcover any extraordi
nary Powers they are pofTefs
d offupcrior to others,
and this Itch prevailing in me, among the reft, I
was impatient to let this Lady know that I un-
derftood her Compofition perfectly well, nay, as
well as fhe did her felf.
In order to this, happening to be in the Fami
ly once for fome Days, and having the Honour
to be very intimate with her and her Husband
too, J took an Oportunity on an extraordinary
Occafion, when fhe was in the Height of good
Humour, to talk with her &amp;gt;
You mull note, that
as I faid, the Lady was in an extraordinary good
Humour, and there had been a great deal of Mirth
in the Family for fome Days , but one Evening,
Sir E r her Husband, upon fome very fharp
Turn fhe gave to another Gentleman, which
made all the Company pleafant, run to her, and
with a Paflion of good Humour takes her in his
Arms, and turning to me, fays he, Jack, This Wife
of mine is full of Wit and good Humour, but
when fhe has a Mind to be fmart, fhe is the
keeneft little Devil in the World : This was allu
ding to the quick Turn fhe had given the other
Gentleman.
Is that the beft Language you can give your
Wife, fays my Lady? O Madam, fays I, fuch
Devils as you, are all
Jingth $ ay, ay, fays my Lady,
I know that, he has only let a Truth fly out that
he does not underftand : Look ye there now,
fays Sir Edward, could any thing but fuch a dear
Devil as this have faid a thing fo pointed ? Well,
WelI3 adds he3 Dwil tp a Lady in a Man s Arn^s,
oftbeVEVI L; SGI
is a Word of divers Interpretations. Thus they
rallied for a good while, he holding her faft all the
while in his Arms, and frequently luffing her, and
at kit it went off, all in Sunfhine and Mirth.
But the next Day, for I had the Honour to
lodge in the Lady s Father s Houfe, where it all
happen d &amp;gt;
I
fay, the next Day my Lady begins
with me upon the Subject, and that very fmartly,
fo that firft I did not know whether {he was in
jeft or earnefl :
Ay, ay, fays Jhe^ you Men make
nothing of your Wives after you have them, al
luding to the Difcourfe with Sir Edward the Night
before.
Why Madam, fays I, we Men, as you are pleas d
to term it,
if we meet with good Wives wor-
ihip them, and make Idols of them, what would
you have more of us ?
No, no, fays {he, before you have them they
are Angels, but when you have been in Heaven,
adds Jhe and fmil d^ then they are Devils.
Why Madam, fays /, Devils are Angels, you
know, and were the higheft Sort of Angels
once.
Yes, fays Jbe, very fmartly, all Devils are An
gels, but all
Angels are not Devils.
But Madam, fays /, you fhould never take it
ill to be calPd Devil, you know.
I know, fays fbe^ haftily, what d ye mean by
that?
Why Madam, fays /, and look d very gravely
and ferious, I
thought you had known that 1 knew
it, or elfe I would not have faid fo, for I would not
offend you 5 but you may depend I ihall never dif-
cover it, unlefs you order me to do fo for your
particular Service.
Upon this fhe look d har d and wild, and bid
flic explain my felf.
A I told
302, The Modern HISTORY
I told her, I was ready to explain my felf, if
fhe would give me her Word, fhe would not re-
fent it, and would take nothing ill.
She gave me her word folemnly flie would not,
tho like a true Devil fhe broke her Promife with
me all at once.
Well however, being unconcern d whether fhe
kept her Word or no, I
began, by telling her that
I had not long fince obtained the fecond light, and
had fome years ftudied Magic, by which I could
penetrate into many things, which to ordinary
Perception were invifible, and had fome GlafTes,
by the Help of which I could fee into all viil-
onary or imaginary Appearances in a different
Manner than other People did.
Very well, fays Jhe^ fuppofe you can, what s
that to me ?
I told her it was nothing to her any further
than that as fhe knew her felf to be originally not
the fame Creature fhe feem d to be, but was of a
fublime angelic Original $ fo by the Help of my
recited Art I knew it too, and fo far it
might re
late to her.
Very fine, fays fhe, fo you would make a De
vil of me indeed.
I took that Occafion to tell her, I would make
nothing of her but what me was j that I fuppos d
ihe knew well enough God Almighty never
thought fit to make any human Creature fo per
fect and compleatly beautiful as fhe was, but that
fuch were *alfo referved for Figures to be afTum d
by Angels of one Kind or other.
She rallied me upon that, and told me that
would not bring me off, for I had not determined
her for any thing Angelic, but ameer Devil, and
how could I flatter her with being handfome and
a Devil both at the fame time ?
1 told her, as Satan, whom we abufivcly call d
4
303
Devil, was an immortal Seraph, and of an ori
ginal angelic Nature, fo abftraded from any thing
wicked, he was a mofi glorious Being 5 that when
he thought fit to encale himfelf with Flefh, and
walk about in Difguife,it was in his Power equally
with the other Angels to make the Form he took
upon himfelf be as he thought fit, beautiful or de
formM
Here {he difputed the PofTibility of that, and
after charging me faintly with flattering her Face,
told me the Devil could not be reprefented by any
thing handfome, alledging our conftant picturing
the Devil in all the frightful Appearances imagi
nable.
I told her we wrong d him very much in that,
and quoted St. Francis^ to whom the Devil fre
quently appeared in the Form of the moft in
comparably beautiful naked Woman, to allure
him, and what Means he ufed to turn the Ap
pearance into a Devil again, and how he effe&ed it.
She put by the Difcourfe, and returned to that
of Angels, and infilled that Angels did not always
afTume beautiful Appearances 5 that fometimes
they appeared in terrible Shapes, but that when
they did not, it was at bed only amiable Faces,
not exquifitej and that therefore it would not
hold, that to be handfome, fhould always rpnder
them fufpe&ed.
I told her the Devil had more Occafion to
form Beauties than other Angels had, his Bufinefs
being principally to deceive and enfnare Man
kind. And then I
gave her fome Examples upon
the whole.
I found by her Difcourfe fhe was willing e-
nough to pafs for an Angel, but twas the hardeft
thing in the World to convince her that fhe was
a DEVIL, and fhe would not come into that by
any i$eans&amp;gt; fhe argued that I knew her Father,
and
304 The Modern HISTORY
and that her Mother was a very good Woman,
and was delivered of her in the ordinary Way,
and that there was fuch and fuch Ladies who were
prefent in the Room when fhe was born, and that
had often told her fo.
I told her that was nothing in fuch a Cafe as
hersj that when the Old Gentleman had occa-
fiori to transform himfelf into a fine Lady, he
could eafily difpofe of a Child, and place him
felf in the Cradle inftead of it, when the
Nurfe or Mother were afleep $ nay, or when
they were broad awake either, it was the fame
thing to him 5 and I
quoted Luther to her upon
that Occafion, who affirms that it had been fo.
However I faid, to convince her that I knew it,
(for I would have it that fhe knew it
already) iffhe
pleas d I would go to my Chamber and fetch her
my Magick Looking-glafs, where fhe fhould fee
her own Picture, not only as it was an angelick
Picture for the World to admire, but a Devil
alfo frightful enough to any Body but her fclf and
xne that underftood it.
No, no, faid JJje^ I ll look in none of your
conjuring Glafles j I know my felf well enough,
and I defire to look no otherwife than I am.
No, Madam, fays /, I know that very well j
nor do you need any better Shape than that you
appear in, tis moft cxquifitely fine } all the
World knows you are a compleat Beauty, and
that is a clear Evidence what you would be if
your prefent appearing Form was reduced to its
proper Perfonality.
Appearing Form ! fays fhe, why, what would
you make an Apparition of me ?
An Apparition ! Madam, faid I, yes, to be furej
why you know, you are nothing clfe but an Ap
parition; and what elfe would you be, when it isfc
infinitely to your Advantage ?
With

With that, {he turn d pale and angry, and then
rofe up nattily, and look d into the Glafs, (a
lirge Peer-glafs being in the Room) where {he flood,
furveying her felf from Head to Foot, with Va
nity not a little.
I took that Time to flip away, and running
up into my Apartment, I fetch d my Magic
GlafS) as J call d it, in which I had a hol
low Cafe fo framed behind a Looking-glafs,
that in the firfb {he would fee her own Face

I /V s Face, ugly and frightful enough, bui
drefs d up with a Lady s Head-Clothes in a
Circle, the Devil s Face in the Center, and
as it were at a little Diftance behind.
I came down again fo foon that fhe did not
think the Time long, efpecially having fpent it
in
furveying her fair felf j when I return d, I faid,

Come, Madam, do not trouble your felf to look
there, that is not a Glafs capable of {hewing you

waited to fee what Obfervations {he would make)
I ask d her if {he had view d her felf to her Sa-
tisfa&ion ? She faid ihe had, and {he had feen no

look here j and with that I open d che Looking-
flats,
and {he look d in it, but faw nothing but

well enough, I fee no Difference ^ what can you
make of it ? With that I took it a little away &amp;gt;
Don t
you ?
fays /, then I {hou d be miftaken
very much 5 fo I look d in it
my felf, and giving
it a Turn imperceptible to her, I fhew d it her
again, where {he faw the Devil indeed, drefs d
X up
306 The Modern HISTORY
Up like a fine
Lady, but ugly, and Devil like as
could be defircd for a Devil to be.
She ftarted, and cry d out moft horribly, and
told me, fhe thought I was more of a Devil than
ilie,for that flic knew nothing of all thofc Tricks,
and I did it to fright her, fhe believ d I had rais d
the Devil.
I told her it was nothing but her own natural
Picture, and that fhe knew well enough, and that
I did not fhew it her to inform her of it, but to
let her know that I knew it too j that fo fhe
might make no Pretences of being offended when
I talk d familiarly to her of a Thing of this Na
ture.
Very well 5 fo, fays Jhe^ I am a real frightful
Devil, am I ?
O, Madam, fays T, don t
fay, Am I? why you
know what you are, don t
you ? A Devil! ay,
certainly ; as fure as the reft of the World believes
you a Lady.
I had a great deal of farther Difcourfe with her
upon that Subject, tho Ihe would fain have beat
me off of it, and two or three times fhe put the
Talk off, and brought fomething elfe on ; but I
always found Means to revive it, and to attack
her upon the Reality of her being a Devil, till
at laft I made her downright angry, and then (he
fhew d it.
Firfl: fhe cried, told me I came to affront her,
that I would not talk fo if Sir Ed was
by 5 and that fhe ought not to be ufed fo. I en-
deavour d to pacify her, and told her I had not
treated her with any Indecency, nor I would notj
becaufe while ilie
thought fit to walk Abroad
incog, it was none of my Bufinefs to difcover her &amp;gt;
that if {he thought fit to tell Sir Ed any
thing of the Difcourfe, fhe was very welcome,
or to conceal it, (which I thought the wi/eft Courfe)
of the D E V I L. 307
ihe fhould do juft as fhs pleas d &amp;gt;
but I made no
qudlion I fhould convince Sir E her Huf-
band, that what I faid was juft, and that I was
really fo $ whether it was for her Service or no
for him to know it, was for her to confider.
This calm d her a little, and fhe Jook d hard
at me a Minute without fpeaking a Word, when
on a fudden fhe broke out thus : And you will
undertake, fays flie^ to convince SIT Ed that
he has married a Devil, will ye ? A fine Story
indeed ! and what follows? why then it mull: fol
low that the Child I go with (for ihe was big
with Child) will be a Devil too, will it ? A fine
Story for Sir Ed* indeed ! isn t it?
I don t know that, Madam, faid 1, that s as
you order itj by the Father s Side, faid /, I know
it will not, but what it
may by the Mother s
Side, that s a Doubt I can t refolve till the Demi
and I talk farther about it.
You and the Devil talk together !
fays foe, and
looks rufully at me &amp;gt;
why do you talk with the
Devil then ?
Ay, Madam, fays /, as fure as ever you did
your felf j befides, faid I, can you queflion that ?
Pray who am I
talking to now:
I think you are mad, fays Jhe j why you will
make Devils of all the Family, it
may be, and
particularly I mud be with Child of a JDevif,
that s certain.
No, Madam, faid /, tis not certain, as I faid
before, I queflion it.
Why you fay I am the DEVIL, the Child, you
know, has always moft of the Mother in it, then
that mud be a Devil too I think, what elfe can it
be, faysfie ?
I can t tell that, Madam, faid Iy that s as you
agree among your felves, this Kind does not go
by Generation -
9 that s A Difpute foreign to the
prefent Purpofe. X z Then
308 The Modern HISTORY
Then I entred into a Difcourfe with her of the
Ends and Purpofes for which the Devil takes up
fuch beautiful Forms as hers, and why it
always
gave me a Sufpicion when I faw a Lady hand-
fomer than ordinary, and fet me upon the Search
to be fatisfied whether fhe was really a Woman
or an Apparition ? a Lady or a Devil ?
allowing
all
along that her being a Devil was quite out of
the Queftion.
Upon that very Foot, fhe took me up again
roundly, and fo, faysjhe^ you are very civil to me
through all
your Difcourfe, for I fee it ends all in
that, and you take it as a thing confeft, that I am
a Devil ! A very pretty piece of good Ufage in
deed !
faysjhe &amp;gt;
/ thank you for it.
Nay, Madam, fays /, do not take it ill of me,
for I only difcover to you that I knew it 5 I do
not tell it
you as a Secret, for you are fatisfied of
that another way.
Satisfied of what? fays (he, that I am a Devil?
I think the Devil s in you : And fo began to be
hot.
A Devil !
yes, Madam, fays I, without doubt
ameer DEVIL &amp;gt;
take it as you pleafe, I can t
help
that : And fo I began to take it ill that {he fhould
be diigufted at opening fuch a well-known Truth
to her.
With that fhe difcovefd it all at once, for fhe
turn d Fury, in the very Letter of it 5 flew out
in a Paflion, rail d at me, curfl me moft hear
tily, and immediately difappeared j which you
know is the particular Mark of a Spirit or Ap
parition.
We had a great deal of Difcourfe befides this,
relating to fcveral other, young Ladies of her Ac
quaintance, fome of which, 1 laid, were mere Appa-
r/Vttwlikefierfelf* and told her which were fo, and
which not 5 and the Reafon why they were fo,
and
of the DEVIL. 309
and for what Ufes and Purpofes, fome to delude
the World one way, and fome another 3 and ihe
was pretty well pleafed to hear that, but ihe could
not bear to hear her own true Chara&er, which
however, as
cunning as ihe was, made her acl: the
Devil at laft, as you have heard $ and then vaniih-
ed out of my fight.
I have feen her in Miniature feveral Times
fincej but {he proves her felf (till to be the Devil of
a Lady, for ihe bears Malice, and will never forgive
me, that I would not let her be an Angel 5 but
like a very Devil as fhe is, ihe endeavours to kill
me at a Diftance ; and indeed the Poifon of her
Eyes, (Rafilisk-like) is
very flrong, and fhe has
a ftrange Influence upon me&amp;gt; but I that know
her to be a Devil, ftrive very hard with my
felf to drive the Memory of her out of my
Thoughts.
I have had two or three Engagements fince
this, with other Apparitions of the fame Sex, and
I find they are all alike, they are willing enough
to be thought Angels, but the Word Devil does
not go down at all with them : But tis all one,
whenever we fee an Apparition^ it is fo natural to
fay we have feen the Devil, that there s no pre
vailing with Mankind to talk any other Lan
guage. A Gentleman of my Acquaintance, the
other Day, that had courted a Lady a long time,
had the Misfortune to come a little fliddenly up
on her, when ihe did not expecl: him, and found
her in fuch a Rage at fome of her Servants, that
it quite diforder d her, efpecially a Footman ; the
Fellow had done fomething that was indeed pro
voking, but not fufficient to put her into fuch a
Paifion, and fo out of her felfj nor was ihe able
to reftrain her felf when ihe faw her Lover come
in, but damn d the Fellow, and rag d like a Fury
at him.
X 5 My
a io The Modern HISTORY
My Friend did his bed to compofe her, and
begg d the Fellow s Pardon of her, but it would
not doj nay, the poor Fellow made all the Sub-
miffions that could be expected, but twas the
fame thing : And fo the Gentleman, not caring
to engage himfelf farther than became him, with
drew, and came no more at her for three Days,
in all which time fhe was hardly cool.
The next Day my Friend came to me, and
talking of it in Confidence to me, I am afraid,
fays he^ I am going to marry a She Devil) and
ib told me the Story
-
y I took no Notice to him,
but finding out his Miitrefs, and taking proper
Meafurcs, with fome of my particular Skill, I
foon found out that it was really fo, that fhe was
a mere Apparition; and had it not been for that
accidental Diforder of her PafHons, which difco-
ver d her Infide, fhe might indeed have cheated
any Man, for {he was a lovely Devil as ever was
feen 5 fhe talk d like an Angel, fung like a Syren,
did every thing, and faid every thing that was
taking and charming : But what then ? it was all
Apparition, for fhe was a mere Devil. It is
true,
my Friend marry d her, and tho fhe was a Devil
without doubt, yet either fhe behav d fo well, or
he was fo
good, I never could hear him find Fault
with her.
Thefe are particular Inftances 5 but alas ! I
could run you a Length beyond all thofe Exam
ples, and give you fuch a Lift of Devils among
the gay Things of the Town, that would fright
you to think of 3 and you would prefently con
clude, with me, that all the perfect Beauties arc?
Devils, mere Apparitions 5 but Time and Paper
fails, fo we muft only leave the Men the Caution,
let them, venture at their Peril. I return to the
Subject.
We
of the DEVIL. 311
We have a great many charming Apparitions
of like kind go daily about the World in com-
pleat Mafquerade, and, tho we mull not lay fo,
they are in themfelves mere Devils, wicked dan
gerous murthering Devils, that kill various Ways,
iome, Bafilisk-like, with their Eyes &amp;gt;
fome Sy
ren-like, with their Tongues 5 all Murtherers,
even from the Beginning : It is true, tis
pity
thefe pretty Apparitions fhould be Devils, and be
fo mifchievous as they are &amp;gt;
but fince it is fo, I
can do no lefs than to advertife you of it, that
you may ihun the Devil in whatever Shape you
meet with him.
Again, there are fome half Devils, they fay,
like the Sagittarii^ half Man, half Horfe, or ra
ther like the Satyr^ who, they fay
r
,
is half Devil,
half Man &amp;gt;
or, like my Lord Bifhop, who, they
/3} ,was half-headed 5 whether they mean half- wit-
ted or no, I do not find Authors agreed about
it : But if they had voted him fuch, it had been
as kind a thing as any they cou d fay of him, be-
caufe it would have cleared him from the Scandal
of being a Devil, or half a Devil, for we don t
find the Devil makes any Alliance with F- Is.
Then as to merry Devils, there s
my Matter
Q } he may indeed have the Devil in him,
but it muft be faid, to the Credit of Pofleffion in
general, that Satan would have fcorn d to have
entred into a Soul fo narrow that there was not
room to hold him, or to take up with fo difcord-
ing a Creature, fo abject, fo fcoundrel, as never
made a Figure among Mankind greater than that
of a Thier^ a Moroder^ moulded up into Quality,
and a Raparee drefs d up a-U-Mafque, with a Robe
and a Coronet.
Some little
Dog-kennel Devil may indeed take
up his Quarters in or near (him, and fo run into
and out of him as his Drum beats a Call j but
X 4 to
312 The Modern HISTORY
to him that was born a Devil, Satan, that never
acts to no purpofe, cou d not; think him worth
being pofleis d by any thing better than a Devil
of a dirty Quality ; that is to fay, a Spirit too
mean to wear the Name of Devil^ without fome
Badge or Addition of Infamy and Meannefs to
diftingufh it
by.
Thus what Devil of Quality would be con-
fin d to a P ........ ,
who inheriting all the
Pride and Infolence of his Anceftors, without
one of their good Qualities , the Bully, the Bil*
lingsgate^ and all the hereditary ill
Language of
his Family, without an Ounce of their Courage 5
that has been refcued five or iix times from the
Scandal of a Coward, by the Bravery, and at the
Hazard of Friends, and never faiFd to be un
grateful 5 that if ever he committed a Murther,
did it in cold Blood, becaufe no body could prove he
ever had any hot 3 who pofTefs d with a Poltroon
il^ was always wickeder in the Dark, than he
durft be by Day-light 5 and who, after innumer
able paffive Sufferings, has been turned out of hu
man Society, becaufe he could not be kick d or
cufPd either into good Manners or good Hu
mour.
To fay this was a Devil^ an Apparition, or
even a half Devil ,
would be unkind to Satan
jiimfelf, fince tho he (the Devil) has fo many
Millions of inferior Devils under his Command,
not one cou d be found bafe enough to match him,
nor one Devil, found but what would think him-
felf difhonour d to be employ d about him.
Some merry good-for-nothing Devils we have
indeed, which we might, if we had room, (peak
of at large, and divert you too with the Relation,
fuch as my Lady Haft s Devil in E/ex, who up
on laying a Joiner s Mallet in the Window of 3
certain Chamber, would come very orderly and
knock
of the DEVIL. 313
knock with it all
Night upon the Window, or
againft the Wainfcot, and difturb the Neighbour
hood, and then go away in the Morning, as well
fatisfied as may be 3 whereas if the Mallet was
not left, he would think himfelf affronted, and
be as unfufferable and terrifying, as poffible,
breaking the Windows, fplitting the Wainfcot,
committing all the Diforders, and doing all the
Damage that he was able to the Houfe, and to
the Goods in it. And again, fuch as the Drum-
ing Devil in the Well at Oundle in Northampton&quot;
Jlrire^ and fuch like.
A great many antick Devils have been feen al-
fo, who feem d to have little or nothing to do,
but only to allure us that they can appear if they
pleafe, and that there is a Reality in the thing
call d Apparition.
As to Shadows of Devils, and imaginary Ap
pearances, fuch as
appear, and yet are invifible at
the fame time, I had thought to have beftow d a
Chapter upon them by themfelves, but it may be
as much to the Purpofe to let them alone, as to
meddle with them j tis faid our old Friend Lu
ther ufed to be exceedingly troubled with fuch
invifible Apparitions ,
and he tells us much of
them, in what they call his Table-talk -
y but with
Matter Luther s leave, tho the Devil pafTes for
a very great Lyar, I could fwallow many things
of his own proper making, as foon as fome of
thofc I find in a Book that goes by his Name,
particularly the Story of the Devil in a Basket,
the Child flying out of the Cradle, and the
like.
In a word, the walking Devils that we have
generally among us, are of the female Sex j whe
ther it be that the Devil finds lefs Difficulty to
manage them, or that he lives quieter with them,
or that they arc fitter for his Bufinefs than the
2 Men9
The Modern HISTORY
Men, I fliall not now enter into a Difpute about
that -, perhaps he goes better difguis d in the fair
Sex than otherwife $ Antiquity gives us many
Hiftories of She-Devils, fuch as \vc can very
feldom match for Wickedneis among the Men &amp;gt;
fuch now as in the Text, Let s
Daughters, Jo-
fepb s Miftrefs, Sampfon s
Dalilah, Herod s Hero-
dias^ thefe were certainly Devils, or play d the
Devil fufficiently in their Turn j one Male
Apparition indeed the Scripture furnifhes you
with, and that is
Judas ; for his Matter fays ex-
prefly of him, One of you is a Devil ; not has the
Devil, or is
pofiefs d of the DEVIL 5 but really is
a DEVIL, or is a real DEVIL.
How happy is it, that this great Secret comes
thus to be difcover d to mankind ?
Certainly the
World has gone on in Ignorance a long time,
and at a ftrange rate, that we ihould have fo
many Devils continually walking about among us
in humane Shape, and we know it not.
Philofophers tell us that there is a World of
Spirits, and many learned Pieces of Guefs-work
they make at it, representing the World to be
fo near us, that the Air, as they defcribe it, muft
be full of Dragons and Devils^ enough to fright
our Imaginations with the very Thoughts of
them ; and if they fay true, tis our great
Felicity that we cannot fee any Eirthcr into it
than we do, which if we could, would appear as
frightful as Hell itfelf &amp;gt;
but none of thofe Sages
ever told us, till now, that half the People who
converfe with us MZ Apparitions^ efpecially of the
Women &amp;gt;
and among them efpecially this valu
able Part, the Woman of Figure, the fair, the
beautiful, or patch d and painted.
This unufual Phenomenon has been feen but a
little while, and but a little way, and the general
Part of Mankind cannot come into the fame No
tions
of the DEVIL. 315
tions about it j nay, perhaps they will all think it
ftrange 5 but be it as
ftrange as it will, the Na
ture of the Thing confirms it, this lower Sphere
is full of Devils j and fome of both Sexes have
given ftrange Teftimonies of the Reality of their
pre-exiflent Devilifm for many Ages part, tho
1 think it never came to that Height as it has
now.
It is true, in former times Satan dealt much in
old Women, and thofe, as I have obfcrv d alrea
dy, very ugly, Ugly as a Witch, Black as a Witch^ /
look like a Witch^ all
proverbial Speeches, and which
teftify d what Tools it was Satan generally work d
with 5 and thefe old Spec~bres, they tell us, us d
to ride thro the Air in the Night, and upon
Broomfticks too, all
mighty homely Doings &amp;gt;
fome fay they us d to go to vifit their Grand
Seignior the Devil) in thofe Nocturnal Perambu
lations : But be that as it will, tis certain the
Devil has chang d hands, and that now he walks
about the World cloth d in Beauty, cover d with
the Charms of the Lovely, and he fails not to
difguife himfelf effectually by it, for who would
think a beautiful Lady could be a Mafque to the
Devil? and that a fine Face, a divine Shape, a
heavenly Afpec~r, ihould bring the Devil in her
Company, nay, fliould be herfelf an ^pparition^
a mere DEVIL.
The Enquiry is indeed worth our while, and
therefore I hope all the enamoured Beaus and
Boys, all the Beauty-hunters and Fortune-hunters,
will take heed, for I fuppofe if they get the DC-
vil, they will not complain for want of a For
tune 3 and there s
Danger enough, I allure you,
for the World is full of Apparitions, non rofa
fine fpinis 5 not a Beauty without a Devil^ the
old Women Spe6bres, and the young Women

CHAP. VIII.
Of the Cloven- Foot walking about the World
without the Devil, (viz.) of Witches
waking Bargains for the Devil, and par
ticularly of felling the Soul to the Devil.
I
Have dwelt long upon the Devil in Mafque
as he goes about the World incog, and efpe-
cially without his Cloven-Foot, and have touch
ed upon ibme of his Difguifes in the Manage
ment of his Intereft in the World 5 I muft lay
fome of his Difguifes only, for who can give a
full account of all his Tricks and Arts in fo nar
row a Compafs as I am prefcrib d to ?
But as I laid, that every Devil has not a Clo
ven-Foot, fo I muft add now for the prefent
Purpofe, that every Cloven-Foot is not the Devil.
Not but that wherever I fliould meet the Clo
ven-Hoof, I fliould expect that the Devil was not
far off, and fliould be apt to raife the PofTe againft
him, to apprehend him j yet it
may happen other-
wife, that s certain &amp;gt;
every Coin has its Counter
feit, every Art its Pretender, every Whore her
Admirer, every Error its Patron, and every Day
has its DEVIL.
I have had fome thought of making a full and
compleat Difcovery here of that great Doubt
which has fo long piizzl d the World, namely,
whether there is
any fuch Thing, as fecret making
Bargains with the Devil, and the firft positive
Aflurance I can give you in the Cafe, is,
that if
there
of theDE VIL; 317
there is not, tis not his Fault, tis not for want
of his Endeavour, tis
plain, if you will pardon me
for taking fo mean a Step, as that of quoting
Scripture j I fay, tis evident he would fain have
made a Contract with our Saviour, and he bid
boldly (give him his due} namely, all the King
doms of the World for one bend of his Knee : Im
pudent Seraph ! To think thy Lord fhould pay
thee Homage ! How many would agree with him
here for a lefs Price !
They fay, Oliver Cromwell
ftruck a Bargain with him, and that he gave
Oliver the Prote&orfhip, but would not let him
call himfelf King, which (luck fo clofe to that
Furiofo) that the Mortification fpread into his
Soul, and tis faid, he dy d of a Garigreen in the
Spleen. But take Notice and do Oliver Juftice ;
I do not vouch the Story, neither does the Bi-
iliop fay one Word of it.
Fame us d to fay, that the old famous Duke of
Luxemburg [made a Magic compact of this Kind 5
nay, I have heard many an (old Woman) Officer
of the Troops, who never car d to fee his Face, de
clare that he carry d the Devil at his Back. I re
member a certain Author of a News Paper in Lon
don was once taken up, and they fay, it coft him
fo/. for printing in his News, that Luxemburg
was Humpbacked. Now if I have refolv d the Dif
ficulty, namely, that he was not hump d, only
carry d the Devil at his Back 5 I think the poor
Man fhould have his fo /.
again, or I fhould have
it for the Difcovery.
I confefs, I do not virell underfland this com
pacting with fach a Fellow as can neither write
nor read j nor do I know who is the Scrivener
between them, or how the Indenture can be exe
cuted j but that which is worfe than all the reft
is, that in the firft Place, the Devil never keeps
Articles j he will contract perhaps, and they fay
he
|is The Modern HISTORY
he is mighty forward to make Conditions 5 but whd
{hall bind him to the Performance, and where is the
Penalty if he fails? if we agree with him, he
will be apt enough to claim his Bargain and de
mand Payment \ nay, perhaps before it is due $
but who fhall make him fland to his.
Beiides, he is a Knave in his
Dealing, for he
really promifes what he cannot perform j wit-
nefs his impudent Propofal to our Lord mention
ed above, All thefe Kingdoms will I give thee !
Lying Spirit ! Why they were none of thine to
give, no not one of them j for the Earth is the
Lords and the kingdoms thereof, nor were they
in his Power any more than in his Right : So ( I
have heard that) fome poor difmal Creatures have
fold thcmfclves to the Devil for a Sum of Money,
for fo much Cafh, and yet even in that Cafe,
when the Day of Payment came, I never heard
that he brought the Money or paid the Purchafe,
fo that he is a Scoundrel in his Treaties, for you
ihall trufl for your Bargain, but not be able to
get your Money 5 and yet for your Part, he
comes for you to an Hour :
Of which by it
felf.
In a Word, let me caution you all, when you
trade with the Devil, either get the Price or quit
the Bargain &amp;gt;
the Devil is a cunning Shaver, he
will wriggle himfelf out of the Performance on
his Side if poffible, and yet expect you fhould
be punctual on your Side. They tell you of a
poor Fellow in Herefordjhire^ that offer d to fell
his Soul to him for a Cow, and though the De~
vii promifed, and as they fay, fign d the Wri
tings, yet the poor Countryman could never get
the Cow of him, but flill as he brought a Cow
to him, fome body or other came and challeng d
it, proving that it was loft or ftolen from them &amp;gt;
fo that the Man got nothing but the Name of a
Cow-itcaler, and was at laft carried to Hereford
Goal
vfthe DEVIL, 319
Goal, and condemned to be hang d for
dealing two
Cows, one after the other : The wicked Fellow
Was then in the greateft Diftrefs
imaginable, he
fummon d his Devil to help him out, but he fail
ed him, as the Devil always will $&amp;gt;he
really had
not ftolen the Cows, but they were found in his
PoiTefHon, and he could give no Account how
he came by them -,
at laft he was driven to confefs
the Truth, told the horrid Bargain he had made,
and how the Devil often promised him a Cow,
but never gave him one, except that feveral Times
in the Morning early he found a Cow put into his
Yard, but it always prov d to belong to fome of
his Neighbours : Whether the Man was hang d
or no, the Story does not relate -,
but this Part is
to my Purpofe, that they that make Bargains
with the Devi^ ought to make him give Secu
rity for the Performance of Covenants, and who
the Devil would get to be bound for him, I can t
tell, they muft look to that who make the Bar
gain :
Befides, if he had not had a Mind to cheat
or baffle the poor Man, what need he have taken
a Cow fo near home ? if he had fuch and fuch
Powers as we talk of, and as Fancy and Fable fur-
niih for him, could not he have carried a Cow
in the Air upon a Broom- Hick, as well as an old
Woman ? Could he not have flole a Cow for him
in Lincoln/hire^ and fet it down in Hereford/hire^
and fo have performed his Bargain, faved his Credit,
and kept the poor Man out of Trouble ? fo that
if the Story is True, as I really believe it is, either
it is not the Devil that makes thofe Bargains, or
the Devil has not fuch Power as we bellow on
him, except on fpecial Occafions he gets a Per
mit, and is bid go, as in the Cafe of Job^ the
Gadaren Hogs^ and the like.
We have another Example of a Man s
felling
himfelf to the Devil, that is
very remarkable, and
that
320 The MoJernHIS TORY
that is in the Bible too, and even in that, I do
not find, what the Devil did for him, in Payment
of the Purchafe Price. The Perfon felling was
Ahab) of whom the Text fays exprefly, there
was none like him, who did fell himfelf to work
Wickednefs in the Sight of the LORD, i
Kings xxi.
20, and the ^$. I think it
might have been ren-
dred, if no tranflated in Spight of the Lord^ or
in Defiance of God; for certainly that s the Mean
ing of it ^ and now allowing me to preach a lit
tle
upon this Text, my Sermon {hall be very
fhort. Ahab fold himfelf, who did he fell him
felf to ? I anfwer that Queftion by a Queftion j
who would buy him ? who, as *we fay^ would
give any thing for him ? and the Anfwer to that is
plain alfo, you may judge of the Purchafer by
the Work he was to do 5 he that buys a Slave in
the Market, buys him to work for him, and to do
fuch Bufinefs as he has for him to do : Ahab was
bought to work wickednefs, and who would buy
him for that but the Devil ?
I think there s no room to doubt but Ahab
fold himfelf to the Devil 5 the Text is
plain that
he fold himfelf, and the Work he was fold to do
points out the Mafter that bought him 5 what
Price he agreed with the Devil for, that indeed
the Text is filent in, fo we may let it alone, nor
is it much to our Purpofe, unlefs it be to enquire
whether the Devil ftood to his Bargain or not,
and whether he paid the Money according to A-
greement, or cheated him as he did the Farmer at
Hereford.
This buying and felling between the Devil and
us, is, I rnufl confefs, an odd kind ofStock-jobbing,
and indeed the Devil may be faid to fell the Bear-skin^
whatever he buys $ but the flrangeft Part is when
he comes to demand the transfer 5 for as I hint
ed before, whether he Performs or no, he expeclrs
his
of the DEVIL. 3Jt
his Bargain to a Tittle 5 there is indeed fome Dif
ficulty in refolving how and in what Manner
Payment is made 5 the Stories we meet with in
our Chimney-Corner Hifiories, and which are
fo many Ways made Uie of to make the Devil
frightful to us and our Heirs for ever, arc general
ly fo foolifh and ridiculous, as, if true or not true,
they have nothing Material in them, are of no
Signification, or elfe fo impoilible in their Na
ture, that they make no Impreilion upon any
body above twelve Years old and under ieventy
*
y
or elfe are fo tragical that Antiquity has fabled
them down to our Tafte, that we might be able
to hear them and repeat them with lefs Horror
than is due to them.
This Variety has taken off our Relifh of the
Thing in
general, and made the Trade of Soul-
felling, like our late more eminent Bubbles, be
taken to be a Cheat and to have little in it.
However, to (peak a little more gravely to it,
I cannot fay but that fince, by the two eminent
Inflances of it above in Ahab^ and in Chrift him-
felf, the Fa6t is
evidently afcertain d &amp;gt;
and that
the Devil has attempted to make fuch a Bargain
on one, and actually did make it with the o-
ther. The Poffibility of it is not to be difpu-
tedj but then I mult explain the Manner of it
a little, and bring it down, nearer to our Under-
{landing, that it may be more intelligible than it
is 5 for as for this felling the Soul, and making a
Bargain to give the Devil PofTeffion by Livery
and Seifin on the Day appointed, that I cannot
come into by any Means; no nor into the other
Part, namely, of the Devil coming to claim his Bar
gain, and to demand the Soul according to Agree
ment, and upon Default of a fair Delivery, taking
it away by Violence Cafe andall^ ofwhich we have
many hiftorical Relations pretty current among
Y usj
32* The Modern HISTORY
us j fome of which, for ought I know^ we mignt
have hop d had been true, if we had not been lure
they were falfe, and others we had Reafon to fear
were falfe, becaufe it was impoffible they fhould
be true.
The Bargains of this Kind, according to the
bed Accounts we have of them, ufed to confift
of two main Articles, according to the ordinary
Stipulations in all Covenants; namely,
1. Something to be perform d on the Devil s
Part, buying.
2. Something to be perform d on the Man s
Part, felling.
i . The Devil s Part : This was generally fome
poor Trifle, for the Devil generally bought good
Penny-worths, and oftentimes like a compleat Shar
per, agreed to give what he was not able to procure $
that is to fay, would bargain for a Price he could
not pay, as in the Cafe of the Hereford Man and
the Cow 5 for Example, i.
Long Life: This tho*
the deluded Chapman has often had folly enough
to contract for, the Devil never had Power to
make good $ and we have a famous Story, how
true 1 know not, of a Wretch that fold himfelf
to the DEVIL on Condition he, Satan, fhould
allure him (i.) That he fhould never want Victu
als 5 (i.) That he fhould never be a cold * (3,)
That he fhould always come to him when hecalFd
him \ and (4.) That he ihould let him live one and
twenty Years, and then Satan was at Liberty to
have him 5 that is, I
fuppofe, to take him where-
ever he could find him.
It fecms, the Fellow s defire to be aflur d of 2.x
Years Life, was chiefly, that during that Time,,
he might be as wicked as he would, and fhould yet
be fure not to be hang d, nay, to be free from
all Punifhment ; upon this Foot tis faid he com-
xnenc d Rogue, and committed a great many Rob*
c beries
DEVIL; 323
berics and other villanous Things 5 now it feems
the Devil was pretty true to his
Bargain in feveral
ofthofe things 5 particularly, that two or three times
when the Fellow was taken up for petty Crimes,
and call d for his old Friend, he came and fright
ed the Constables fo, that they let the Offender
get away from them : But at
Length having
done fome capital Crime, a Set of Conflables, or
fuch like Officers, feiz d upon him, who were
not to be frighted with the Devil, in what Shape
foever he appear d 5 fo that they carry d him off,
and he was committed to Newgate or fome other
Prifon as effectual.
Nor could Satan with all his Skill unlock his
Fetters, much lefs the Prifon Doors j But he
was try d, convicted, and executed. The Fel
low in his Extremity, theyfay, expostulated with
the Devil for his Bargain, the Term of 2.1 Years
it fecms not being expir d. But the Devil^ it
is faid, fliufH d with him, told him a good while,
he would get him out, bid him have Patience and
flay a little, and thus led him on, till he came
as it were within Sight of the Gallows5
that, is
to fay, within a Day or two of his Execution &amp;gt;
when the Devil cavuTd upon his Bargain, told
him, he agreed to let him live zi Years, and he
had not hindred him, but that he did not Co
venant to caufe him to live that Time &amp;gt;
that there
was a great deal of Difference between doing
and fufferingj that he was to fuffer him to live,
and that he did 5 but he could not make him live
when he had brought himfelf to the Gallows.
Whether this Story were true or not, for you
muft not expect we Hiftorians fhould anfwer for
the Difcourfe between the Devil and his Chaps,
becaufe we were not privy to the Bargain : I fay,
whether it was true or not, the Inference is to
our Purpofe feveral Ways.
Y z *. It
324 The Modern HISTORY
i. It confirms what I havefaid of the Knavery
of the Devil in his Dealings, and that when
he has Stock -jobb d with us on the bed
Conditions he can get, he very ieldom per
forms his Bargain.
z. It confirms what I have likewife faid, that
the Devifs Power is limited 5 with this Addi
tion, that he not only cannot deltroy the
Life of Man, but that he cannot preferve it *
in foort) he can neither prevent or bring on
our Deftrution.
I may be allowed, I
hope, for the Sake of the pre-
fent Dilcourfe, to fuppofe that the Devil would
have been fo juft
to this wicked, tho foolifh Crea
ture, as to have fav d him from the Gallows if he
could &amp;gt;
but it feems, he at laft acknowledged that
it was not in his Power 3 nay, he could not keep
him from being taken and carry d to Prifon, af
ter he was gotten into the Hands of a bold Fel
low or two, that were not to be fcar d with his
Blufter, as fome fooliili Creatures had been before.
And how fimple, how weak, how unlike any
Thing of an Angelick Nature, was it to attempt
to (live the poor Wretch, only by little Noifes
and fham Appearances, putting
out the Candles,
rufhing and jofleling
in the Dark, and the like !
If the Devil was that mighty Seraph,which wehave
heard of, if he is a God of this World, a Prince
of the Air, a Spirit able to deftroy Cities and
make Havock in the World 5 if he canraifeTem-
pefts and Storms, throw Fire about the World,
and do wonderful Things, as an unchain d Ztavtao
Doubt could do j
what need all this Frippery ? and
\vhat need he try lo many ridiculous Ways, by the
Emptinefs, nay, the filly
nonfenfical Manner, of
which, he {hews, that he is able to do no better,
and
of the DEVI L. 325
and that his Power is
extinguiuYd ? In a
he would certainly ac~b
otherwife, if he could. Sed
caret pedibus^ he wants Power.
How weak a thing is it then, for
any Man to
expec~b Performance from the Devil ? If he has
not Power to do Mifchief, which is his Element,
his very Nature, and on many Accounts, is the
very fum of his Deiires j How fhould he have
Power to do Good ? how Power to deliver from
Danger or from Death ? which Deliverance would
be in itielf a Good, and we know it is not in his
Nature to do Good to or for any Man ?
In a Word, the -Devil is
ftrangely impudent, to
think that any Man fhould depend upon him for
the Performance of an Agreement of any Kind
whatever, when he knows himlelf, that he is not
able, if he was honeft enough, to be as
good as
his Word.
Come we next to his expecting our Perform
ance to him &amp;gt;
tho he is not fo jufl to us, yet, it
feems, he never fails to come and demand Pay
ment of us at the very Day appointed : He was
but a weak Trader in Things of this Nature, who
having fold his Soul to the Devil^ fo our old
Women s Tales call the Thing, and when the
Devil came to demand his Bargain, put it off as
a Thing of no Force, for that it was done fo long
ago, he thought he (the Devil) had forgot it. It was
a better Anfwer, which they tell us, a Lutheran
Divine gave the Devil in the Name of a poor
Wretch, who had fold himfelf to the Devil, and
who was in a terrible Fright about his coming
for his Bargain, as he might well be indeed, if
the Devil has fuch a Power, as really to come and
take it
by Force. The Story (if you can bear a
feriotts one) is this.
The Man was in great Horror of Mind, and
the Family fear d he would deftroy himfelf&amp;gt; at
Y 5 length
326 The Modern HISTORY
length they fent for a Lutheran Minifler to talk
\vith him, and who after ibme Labour with him,
got out the Truth (viz,) that he had fold himfelf
to the Devil, and that the Time was almoft
expir d, when he expe&ed the Devil would
come and fetch him away, and he was fore he
would not fail
coming to the Time to a Minute ,
the Minifler firfl endeavour d to convince him
of the horrid Crime, and to bring him to a true
Penitence for that Part &amp;gt;
and having as he thought
made him a fincere Penitent, he then began to
encourage him, and particularly* defir d of him,
that when the Time was come, that the Devil
fhould fetch him away, he, the Minifler, fhould
be in the Houfe with him 5
accordingly,
to make
the Story faort, the Time came, the Devil came,
and the Minifler was prefent, when the Devil
came , what Shape he was in, the Story does
not fay 5 the Man fliid he law him, and cry d
out \ the Miniller could not fee him, but the
Man affirming he was in the Room, the Mini
fler faid aloud, in the Name of the living God,
Satan^ what comeft thou here for ? The Devil:
anfwer d, I come for my .own &amp;gt;
the Minifler an-
fwer d, He is not thy own^ for Jefus Chrift has re-
deenfd him, and in his Name 1 charge thee to avoid.
and touch him not, at which, fays the Story, the
Devil gave a furious Stamp (with his Cloven-
Foot I
fuppofe) and went away, and was never
known to molefl him afterward.
Another Story, tho it be in it felf a long one,
I iliull
abridge (for your reading with the Icfs
Une-Afiiicfs) as follows.
A young Gentleman of &crg9
in the Elector
of Brandenburg]?* (now the King of Pruflta s)
Dominions, being deeply in Love with a beautiful
Lady, but fomething above his Fortune, and whom
he could by no Means bring to love him again,
apply d
Of the DEVIL. 327
apply d himfelf to an old thing call d a Witch^ for
her AHiftance, and promifed her great Things,
if flie could bring the Lady to love him, or any
how compafs her, fo as he might have his Will
of her 5 nay, at lafl he told her he would give up
his Soul to her, if{he would anfwer his Defire.
The old Hag, it feems, having had fome of his
Money, had very honeftly tried what {he could
do, but all to no Purpofe, the Lady would not
comply j but when he offer d fuch a great Price,
fhe told him, {he would conGder farther ngainll
fuch a Time, and fo appointed him the next Even
ing-
At the Time appointed he comes, and the
Witch made a
long Speech to him upon the Ni
cety of the Affair; I fuppofe to prepare him not
to be furpriz d at what was to come ; for {he
fuppos d he was not fo very defperately bent as
he appear d to be 5 {he told him it was a Thing
of very great Difficulty &amp;gt;
but as he had made fuch
a great Offer, of felling bis Soul for //, {he had
an Acquaintance in the Houfe, who was better
skilFd (than fhe was) in fuch particular Things, and
would treat with him farther, and {he doubted
not but that both together they might anfwcr his
End. The Fellow it feems was ftill of the fame
Mind, and told her, he car d not what he pawn d
or fold, if he could but obtain the Lady 5 well,
fays the old Hag, fit 1U11 a while, and with that
(he withdraws.
By and by {he comes in again with a Queftion
in her Mouth -,
pray, fays {he, do you feek this
J^ady for a Wife, or for a Miftrefs, would you
marry her, or would you only lie with her? The
young Man told her 0, #0, he did not expect
{he would lie with him, therefore he would be
fatisfied to marry her, but asks her the Reafon of
the Queilion , why truly, fays the old Hag, my
Y 4 Reafon
328 The Modern HISTORY
Reafon is
very Weighty ; for if you would have
her for your Wife, I doubt, we can do you no
Service &amp;gt;
but if you have a Mind to lie with her,
the Perfon, I fpeak of,, will undertake it.
The Man was furpriz d at that, only he objected
that this was a tranfient or fhort Felicity, and that
he fhould perhaps have her no more j the old Hag
bid him not fear, but that if fhe once yielded
to be his Whore, he might have her as often as
he pleafed 5 upon this he confents, for he was
Hark mad for the Lady 5 Behaving confented, fhe
told him then, he ihould follow her, but told him,
whoever he faw, he muft fpeak to no body but
her, till fhe gave him leave, and that he fhould
not be fur prized, whatever happened, for no hurt
fhould befall him $ all which he agreed to, and
the old Woman going out he follow d her.
Being upon this led into another Room,
where there was but very little Light, yet enough
to let him fee that there was no body in it but
hiinfelf and the Woman, he was defired to fit
down in a Chair next to a Table, and the old
Woman clapping the Door too after her, he
asked her why fhe ihut the Door, and where
was the Perfon ilic told him of? At which fhe
anfwer d there he /V, pointing to a Chair at a lit
tle Di (lance: The young Gentleman turning his
Head, faw a grave Kind of a Man fitting in an
Elbow-Chair, tho he faid, he could have fworn
there was no body in the Chair when the old Wo
man {hut the Door 5 however, having promis d
not to fpeak to any body but the old Woman.,
he faid not a Word*
By and by the Woman making abundance of
flrange Geftures and Motions, and mumbling over
feveral Things which he could not under/land,
on a fuddain a large Wicker-Chair, which flood
by the Chimney, removes to the other End of
the
of the DEVIL; 329
the Table which he fat by, but there was no
body in the Chair &amp;gt;
in about two Minutes after
that the Chair remov d, there appear d a Pcrfon fit
ting in that too, who, the Room being, as is faid,
almoft dark, could not be fo diftinguiih d by the
ye, as to fee his Countenance.
After fome while, the firfl Man, and the Chair
lie fat in, mov d, as if they had been one Body,
to the Table alfo j and the old Woman and the two
Men feem d to talk together, but the young Man
could not underiland any Thing they faid -,
after
fome Time the old Witch turn d to the young
Gentleman, told him his Requefl was granted,
but not for Marriage, but the Lady fhould love
and receive him.
The Witch then gave him a Stick dipt in Tar
at both Ends, and bid him hold it to a Candle,
which he did, and inftead of burning like a Stick
it burnt out like a Torch &amp;gt;
then foe bid kmrbreak
it off in the Middle^ and light the other End j he
did that too, and all the Room feem d to be in a
light Flame , then {he laid, deliver one Piece here,
pointing to one only of the Perfons,fo he gave the
firft Fire-flick to the firft Man or Apparition*,
now fays fhe, deliver the other here, fo he gave
the other Piece to the other Apparition, at which
they both rofe.up and fpoke to him Words,
which he faid he underilood not, and could |pt
repeat, and immediately vanifh d with the Fire-
flicks and all, leaving the Room full of Smoke :
I do not remember that the Story fays any Thing
of Brimilone, or the Smell of it, but it
fays the
Door continued fail lock d, and no Body was left
in the Room but the young Gentleman and the
Witch.
Now the Ceremony being over, he ask d the
Witch if the Bufinefs was done ? She faid yes.
Well, but fays he?
have I fold my Soul to the
Devil
330 The Modern HISTORY
Devil? Yes, fays fhe, you have, and you gave
him PofTcffion, when you delivered the two Fire-
flicks to him. fo him! fays he, why, was that
the Devil? Yes, (ays the old Hag. At which the
young Man was in a terrible Fright for a while,
but it went off again.
And what s next, fays he, when fhall I fee the
the Lady for whole fake I have done all this?
You fhall know that prefcntly, faid fhe, and open
ing the Door, in the next Room fhe prefents him
with a moft beautiful Lady, but had charged
him not to fpeak a Word to her : She was exactly
drefs d like, and he prefently knew her to be the La-&amp;gt;
dy he denYd &amp;gt;
upon which he flew to her and
clafped her in his Arms, but that Moment he had
her fad, as he thought, in his Arms, fhe vanifh d
out of his fight.
Finding himfelf thus difoppointed, he upbraids
the old Woman with betraying him, and flew
out with ill
Language at her, in a great Rage 5 the
Devil often deluded him thus, after this, with
Shews and Appearances, but ftill no Perform
ance i after a&quot; while he gets an Opportunity to
fpeak with the Lady her felf in Reality, but fhe
5vas as pofitivc in her Denial as ever, and even
took away all
Hopes of his ever obtaining her,
which put him intoDefpairj for now he thought
he had given himfelf up to the Devil for nothing,
and this brought him to himfelf&amp;gt;
fo that he made
a penitent Confeffion of his Crime to fome Friends,
\vho took great Care of him, and encouraged
him, and at lad furnirh d him with fuch an An-
fwer as put the Devil into a Fright, when he cams
for the Bargain.
For Satan, it feems, as the Story fayS, had the
Impudence to demand his Agreement, notwith -
llanding he had fail d in the Performance on his
Part j what the Anfwer was I do not pretend to
have
of the DEVIL:
havfeen, but it feems it was fomething like what
is mention d above, (viz} that he was in better
Hands, and that he dtirft not touch him.
I have heard of another Perfon that had actual
ly fign d a Contract with the Devil &amp;gt;
and upon
a Fall kept by fome Proteftant or Chriftian Di
vines, while they were praying for the poor Man,
the Devil was oblig d to come and throw the
Cont raft in at the Window.
But I vouch none of thele Stories, there may
be much in them and much Ufe made of them,
even whether exactly fuch in Faft, as
they arc
related, or no &amp;gt;
the beft Ufe I can make of them,
is
this, if any wicked defperate Wretches have made
Bargain and Sale with Satan^ their only Way
is to repent, if they know how, and that before
he comes to claim them ; then batter him with
his own Guns j play Religion againft Devilifm,
and perhaps they may drive the Devil out of
their Reach &amp;gt;
at leaft he will not come at them,
which is as well,
On the other Hand, how many Stones have
we handed about of the DeviPs really coming
with a terrible Appearance at the Time appoint
ed, and powerfully or by violence carrying away
thofe, that have given themfelves thus up to him ;
nay, and fometimes a Piece of the Houfe along
with them, as in the famous Inftance of Sudbury^
Anno 1 66 z. It feems he comes with Rage and
Fury upon fuch Occafions, pretending he only
comes to take his own, or as if he had leave giv
en him to come and take his Goods, as we fay^
where he could find them, and would ftrike a
Terror into all that ihould oppofe him.
The greater! Part of the Terror we are ufually in
upon this Occafion, is from a Suppofition, that
when this Hell-Fire Contract is once made, God
allows the Devil to come and take $e wick
ed
3 *s The Modern HISTORY
ed Creature, how and in what manner he thinks
fit, as being given up to him by his own Act and
Deed $ but in my Opinion there s no Divinity
at all in that $ for as in our Law we punifh a
Felo defe^ or Self-murtherer, becaufe, as the Law
faggefoi he had no Right to difmifs his own Life ;
that he being a Subject of the Common-wealth,
the Government claims the Ward or Cuftody of
him, and fo twas not Murther only, but Robbery,
and is a Felony againlt the State, robbing the
King of his Liege-Man, as tis
juftly caWd-
y fo
neither has any Man a Right to difpofe of his
Soul, which belongs to his Maker in
Property and
in Right of Creation : The Man then having no
Right to fell, Satan has no Right to buy, or at beft
he has made a Purchafe without a Title, and con-
fequently has no juft Claim to the PofTeffion.
It is therefore a Miftake to fay, that when any
of us have been fo mad to make fuch a pretend
ed Contract with the Devil, that God gives him
leave to take it as his Due 5 V/V no fuch thing $ the
Devil IMS bought, what you had no Right to fell,
and therefore, as an unlawful Oath is to be re
pented of, and then broken $ fo your Bufinefs is
to repent of the Crime, and then tell the Devil^
you have better confider d of it, and that you
won t Hand to your Bargain, for you had no
Power to fell &amp;gt;
and if he pretends to Violence
after that, I am miftaken &amp;gt;
I believe the Devil
knows better.
It is true, our old Mothers and Nurfes have
told us other Things, but they only told us what
their Mothers and Nurfes told them, and fo the
Tale has been handed down from one Generation
of old Women to another ; but we have no Vou
chers for the Fact other than Oral Tradition, the
Credit of which, I confefs, goes but a very
little Way with me$ nor do I believe it one Jot
the
of the DEVIL: $ 5i
the more for all the frightful Addenda which they
generally join to the Tale, for it never wants a
great Variety of that Kind.
Thus they tell us the Devil carried away Dr.
Fauftus,and took a Piece of the Wall of his Gar
den along with them : Thus at Salisbury the De-
*uil) as it is
faid, and publickly printed, carried
away two Fellows that had given themfelves up
to him, and carried away the Roof of the Houfe
with them, and the like; all which I believe my
Share of 5 befides, if thefe Stories were really
true, they are all
againfl the Devil s true Interefr,
Satan muft be a Fool, which is indeed what I
never took him to be in the Main 5 this would
be the Way not to encreafe the Number of Defpe-
radoes, who fhould thus put themfelves into his
Hand, but to make himfelf a Terror to them -,
and this is one of the moft powerful Objec
tions I have againfl the Thing, for the Devil,
I fay, is no Fool, that muft be acknowledg d 3 he
knows his own Game, and generally plays it
fure.
I might, before I quit this Point, ferioufly re
flect here upon our Beau mondfoiz.) the gay Part of
Mankind, efpecially thofe of the Times we live in,
who walk about in a Compofure and Tranquillity
inexpreffible, and yet as we all know, muft certain
ly have all fold themfelves to the Devil, for the
Power of a&ing the fooliftieft Things with the
greater Applaufe $ it is true, to be a Fool is
the mofl pleafant Life in the World, if the Fool
has but the particular Felicity, which few Fools
want, (viz.) to think themfelves wife : The
learned fay, it is the Dignity and Perfection of
Fools, that they never fail trufting themfelves &amp;gt;
they
believe themfelves fufficient and able for every
Thing &amp;gt;
and hence their want or wafte of Brains is
no Grievance to them, but they hug themfelves
in
3)4 The Modern HISTORY
in the Sat;iety t
of their own Wit ; but to bring
other People to have the fame Notion of them^
which they Have of themfelves, and to have
their apifti and ridiculous Conduct make the fame
Impreflion on the Minds of others, as it does on
their own; this requires a general Infatuation, and
irmft either be a Judgment from Heaven, or a
Mift of Hell ;
nothing but the Devil can make
all the Men of Brains applaud a Fool, and can
any Man believe, that the Devil will do this for
nothing? no, no, he will be well paid for it, and
I know no other Way they
have to compound
with him, but this of Bargain afid Sale.
Tis the fame thing with Rakes and Bullies, as
tis with Fools and Beaus ; and this brings me to
the Subjcft of buying and felling it felf, and to
examine what is underftood by it in the World,
what People mean by fuch and fuch a Man felling
himfelf to the Devil : I know the common Ac
ceptation of it is, that they make fome Capitula
tion for fome Indulgence in Wickednefs, on Con
ditions of Safety and Impunity, which the Devil
promifes them ; tho as I laid above, he is a
Bite in that too, for he can t
perform the Con
ditions ; however, I fay, he promifes boldly, and
they believe him, and for this
Privilege in Wick-
cdneis, they confent, that he (hall come and fetch
them for his own, at fuch or fuch a Time.
This is the State of the Cafe in the general
Acceptation of it ; I do not fay
tis
really io, nay
tis even an Inconfiftency in it felf; for one would
think, they need not capitulate with the Devil to
be fo, and fo, fuperlatively wicked, and give him
fuch a Price for it, feeing, unlefs we have a wrong
Notion of him, he is
naturally enclin d, as well as
avow dly willing to have all Men be as fuperlative
ly wicked as
poflibly they can, and muft neceflarily
be always ready to ifTue out his Licenfes gratis,
as
far
bf the D E V I L: 35 j
far as his Authority will go in the Cafe 5 and there-
Fore I do not fee why the Wretches that deal
with him, fhould article with him for a Price 5
but fuppofe, for Argument fake, that it is fo, then
the next Thing is, fome capital Crime follows
the Contract, and then the Wretch is
forfaken,
For the Devil cannot protect him, as he promi-
fedj fo he is Trttft up^ and like Cokman at the
Gallows, he exclaims that there is no frutb in
Devils.
It may be true, however, that under the power
ful Guard and Protection of the Devil, Men do
fometimes go a great Way in Crime, and that per
haps farther in thefe our Days of boafted Morals
than was known among our Fathers 5 the on
ly Difference that I meet with between the
Sons of Belial in former Days, and thofe of our
Ages, feems to be in the Devil s
Management,
not in theirs 5 the Sum of which amounts to this,
that Satan feems to act with more Cunning,
and they with lefs j for in the former Ages of
Satan s Dominion, he had much Bufinefs upon
his Hands, all his Art and Engines, and Engineers
alfo, were kept fully employed, to wheedle, allure,
betray and circumvent People, and draw them into
Crimes, and they found him, as we may fay, a full
Employment j I doubt not, he was call d the
Tempter on that very Account ; but the Cafe
feems quite alter d now, the Tables are turned j
then the Devil tempted Men to fin, But now,
in flsort) they tempt the Devil 3 Men pufh into
Crimes before he puihes them j they out fhoot
him in his own Bow, out run him on his own
Ground, and, as we fay of fome hot Spurs who ride
Poll, they whip the Poft-Boy &amp;gt;
in a Word, the
Devil feems to have no Bufineis now but to fit
and look on.
This,
336 The Modern HISTORY
This, I muft cofefs, fcems to intimate fome
fecrct Compact between the Devil and them 5 but
then it looks, not as if they had contracted with
the Devil for leave to fin, but that the Devil had
contracted with them, that they fhould fin fo and
fo, up to fuch a Degree, and that without giving
him the Trouble of daily Solicitation, priratc
Management, and artful fcrewing up their Pal-
fions, their Affections and tUeir molt reur d Fa
culties, as he was before oblig d to do.
This alfo appears more agreeable to the Na
ture of the Thing , and as it is a mofh exquifite
part of Satan s
Cunning, fo tis an undoubted
Teftimony of his Succefs$ if it was not fo, he
could never bring his Kingdom to fuch a height
of abfolute Power as he has done $ this alfo folves
feveral Difficulties in the Affair of the World s
prefent Way of finning, which otherwife it would
be very hard to underitand y as
particularly how
fome eminent Men of Quality among us, whofe
tipper Rooms are not extraordinary well furnifh-
ed in other Cafes, yet are fo very witty in their
Wickednefs, that they gather Admirers by hun
dreds and thoufands -
y who, however heavy, lutn-
pifh, flow and backward, even by Nature, and
in force of Conftitution in better things, yet in
their Race Devil-wards they are of a fudden
grown nimble, light of Foot, and outrun all
their Neighbours &amp;gt;
Fellows that are as empty of
Senfe as Beggars are of Honefty, and as far from
Brains as a Whore is of Modefty ; on a fud
den you {hall find them dip into Polemicks^ ftudy
Michael Servettts^ Soclnus^ and the moft learned
of their Difciples &amp;gt;
they ihall reafon againft all
Religion, as ilrongly as aPhilofopher$ blafpheme
\vith fuch a Keennefs of Wit, and fatyrife
God
and Eternity, with fuch a Brightnefs of Fancy,
as if the Soul of a Rocbcfter or a Hobbs was tranf-
5 migrated
of the DEVIL; as?
ftiigfated
into them 5 in a little
length of Time
more they banter Heaven, burlefque the Trinity,
and jeft
with every facred thing, and ail fo
fharp,
fo ready, and fo terribly witty, as if they were
born Buffoons, and were iingl d out by Nature
to be Champions for the Devil.
Whence can all this come? how is the Change
wrought? who but the Devil can injcc~b Wit in
Spight ofnatural Dullnefs, create Brains, fill
emp
ty Heads, and fupply the Vacuities in the Un-
derftanding ? and will Satan do all this for no
thing ? No, no, he is too wife for that 5 I can
never doubt a fecret Compact, if there is fuch a
thing in Nature i when I fee a Head where there
was no Head, Senfe in Pojft where there is no
Senfe in EJfe, Wit without Brains, and Sight
without Eyes, tis all Devil-Work : Could G
Write Satyrs, that could neither read Latin orfpell
Englijh, like old Sir William Read, who wrote a
Book of Opticks, which when it was printed,
he did not know which was the right Side upper-
moft, and which the wrong ? Could this eminent
uninformed Beau turn Atheift, and make wife
Speeches againft that Being, which made him a
Fool, if the Devil had not fold him fome Wit in
exchange for that Trifle of his, call d Soul? Had
he not bartered his Infide with that Son of the
Morning, to have his Tongue tip d with Blafphe-
my, he that knew nothing of a God, but only
to fwear by him, could never have fet up for a
Wit, to burlefque his Providence and ridicule his
Government of the World.
But the Devil, as he is God of the World, has
one particular Advantage, and that is, that when he
has Work to do he very feldom wants Inflruments j
with this Circumftance alfo, that the Degene
racy of human Nature fupplies him 5 as the
late King of France faid of himfelf, when they
Z told
338 The Modern HISTORY
told him what a Calamity was like to befal his
Kingdom by the Famine: Well, fays the King,
then I {hall not want Soldiers &amp;gt;
and it ivas
/0, want
of Bread (applied his Army with Recruits 5 fo
want of Grace fupplies the Devil with Repro
bates for his Work.
Another Reafon why, I think, the Devil has
made more Bargains of that Kind we fpeak of,
in this
Age, is, becaufe he feems to have laid by
his Cloven-Foot &amp;gt;
all his old Emiflaries, the Tools
of his Trade, the Engineers which he employed
in his Mines, fuch as Witches, Warlocks, Ma
gicians, Conjurers, Aflrologers, and all the hellifh
Train or Rabble of human Devils^ who did his
Drudgery in former Days, feem to be out of
Work : I fhall give you a fuller Enumeration of
them in the next Chapter.
Thefe, I
fay, fecm to be laid aiide , not that
his Work is abated, or that his Bufineis with
Mankind, for their Delufion and Deftruction is
not the fame, or perhaps more than ever 5 but the
Devil feems to have chang d Hands j the Tem
per and Genius of Mankind is alter d, and they
are not to be taken by Fright and Horror, as
they were then : The Figures of thofe Creatures
was always difmal and horrible, and that is it
which I mean by the Cloven-Foot -
y but now Wit,
Beauty and gay Things, are the Sum of his Craft,
he manages by the Soft and the Smooth, the
Fair and the Artful, the Kind and the Cunning,
not by the Frightful and Terrible, the Ugly and
the Odious. :
When the Devil for weighty Difpatches,
Wanted Meflengers cunning and bold,
He pafs d by the beautiful Faces,
And pick d out the Ugly and Old.
Of
of the DE VIL; 339
OF thefe he made Warlocks and Witches^
To run of his Errands by Night,
Till the over wrought Hag- ridden Wretches,
Were as fit as the Devil, to
fright.
But whoever has been his
Advifer,
As his
Kingdom encreafesin Growth -,
He now takes his Meafures much wifer,
And Trafficks with Beauty and Youth.
Difguis d in the Wanton and Witty,
He haunts both the Church and the Court,
And fometimes he vifits the City&amp;gt;
Where all the beft Chriflians refort.
Thus drefs d up in full
Mafquerade,
He the bolder can range up and down*
For he better can drive on his Trade,
In any one s Name than his own.

THO
, as jl have advanc d in the
foregoing
Chapter, the Devil has very much chang d
Hands in his modern Management of the World,
2* and
34o The Modern HISTORY
and that inftead of the Rabble and long Train
of Implements reckoned up above, he now walks
about in Beaus, Beauties, Wits and Fools j yet
I mufl not omit to tell
you that he has not dif-
mifs d his former Regiments, but like Officers
in Time of Peace, he keeps them all in half Pay,
or like Extraordinary Men at the Cuflom-Houfe5
they are kept at a Call, to be ready to fill
up
Vacancies, or to employ when he is more than
ordinarily full of Bufmefsj and therefore it
may
not be amifs to give fome brief Account of them,
from Satan s own Memoirs, their Performance
being no inconfiderable Part of his Hiftory.
Nor will it be an unprofitable Digreifion to
go back a little to the primitive Inftitution of all
thefe Orders, for they are very antient, and I af-
fure you, it
requires great Knowledge of Antiqui
ty, to give a Particular of their Original j I mail
be very brief in it.
In order then to this Enquiry, you mufl: know
that it was not for want of Servants, that Satan
took this Sort of People into his Pay 5 he had,
as I have obierv d in its Place, Millions of dili-
fent
Devils at his Call, whatever Bulinefs, and
owever difficult, he had for them to do$ but as
I have faid above, that our modern People are
forwarder than even the Devil himfelf can defire
them to be j and that they cd?me before they are
call d, run before they are fenr^ and crowd them-
felves into his Service $ fo it feems it was in thofe
early Days, when the World was one univerfal
Monarchy under his Dominion, as I have at large
defcnb d in its Place.
In thofe Days the Wickednefs of the World
keeping a juft Pace with their Ignorance, this in
ferior Sort of low priz d Inftruments did the
Devil s work mighty well &amp;gt;
they drudg d on
in his Black-Art io laborioufly, and with fuch
good
of the DEVIL. 341
good Succefs, that he found it was better to em
ploy them as Tools to delude and draw in Man
kind, than to lend his invifible Implements a-
bout, and oblige them to take fuch Shapes and
Drefles as were neceffary upon every trifling Oo
cafion$ which, perhaps, was more Coft than Wor-
fhip, more Pains than Pay.
Having then a Set ofthefe Voluntiers in his Ser
vice, the true Devil had nothing to do but to
keep an exaft Correfpondence with them, and
communicate fome needful Powers to them, to
make them be and do ibmething extraordinary,
and give them a Reputation in their Bufinefs j
and thefe, in a Word, did a great Part of, nay
almoft all the Devil s Bufinefs in the World.
To this Purpofe gave he them Power, if we
may believe old Glanvilk^ Baxter^ Hlcks^ and other
learn d Confultors of Oracles, to walk invifible,
to fly in the Air, ride upon Broom- (licks, and
other Wooden Gear, to interpret Dreams, an-
fwer Questions, betray Secrets, to talk (Gibbe-
rifh) the univerfal Language, to raife Storms,
fell Winds, bring up Spirits, difturb the Dead, and
torment the Living, with a thoufand other need
ful Tricks to amufe the World, keep themfelves
in Veneration, and carry on the Devil s
Empire
in the World.
The firfr. Nations among whom thefe infernal
Practices were found, were the Chaldeans j and
that I may do Juftice in earneft, as well as in
jeft, it muft be allow d that the Chaldeans, or
thofc of them fo calPd, were not Conjurers or
Magicians, only Philofophers and Studiers of
Nature, wife, fober and fhidious Men at firfr, and
we have an extraordinary Account of them &amp;gt;
and
if we may believe fomc of our belt Writers of
Fame, Abraham was himfelf famous among
{hem for fuch Magick, as Sir Walter Raleigh
Z 5 expreffes
342 The Modern HISTORY
exprefles it, g)ui Contemplations Creaturarum Cog
novit Greatorem. .
Nowgranting this, it is all to my Purpofe, name
ly, that the Devil drew thefe wife Men in, to
fearch after more Knowledge than Nature could
inftrucT: them in &amp;gt;
and the
Knowledge of the true
God being at that Time funk very low, he de-
bauch d them all with Dreams, Apparitions, Con
jurers, &c. till he ruin d the juft Notions they
had, and made Devils of them all, like himfelf.
The learned Senenfisy fpeaking of this Chaldean
Kind of Learning, gives us an Account of five
Sores of them 5 you will pardon me for being fo
grave as to go this Length back.
i. Cbafiedin or Chaldeans3 properly fo calPd,
being Aflronomers.
z. ,/lfapbim or Magicians, fuch was Zoroafires
and Balaam the Son of Beor.
3.
Chatumim or Interpreters of Dreams and
hard Speeches, Inchanters, &c.
4 Mecaffhim or Witches, call d at firfl Pro
phets, afterwards Mahfici or Fenefici^ Poi-
(oners.
.
j-.
Gazarim or Aumfpices^ and Diviners, fuch
as divin d by the Entrails of Beads, the Li
ver in particular
-
y mentioned in Ezek. or as
others, call d Augurs.
Now, as to all thefe, I fuppofe, I may do
them no wrong, if I
fay, however juftifiable
they were in the Beginning, the Devil got them
all into his Service at lad, and that brings me to
iny Text again, from which the reft was a Di-
grdnon,
|.
The Chafcedmw Chaldean Aflronomers turn- .
ed Aftrologers, Fortune-Tellers, Calculators
of
of the D E V I L. 343
of Nativities, and vile Deluders of the Peo
ple, as if the Wifdom of the holy God was
in them, as Nebuchadnezzar faid of Daniel
on that very Account.
Z. The Afaphim or Magi, or Magicians j
Sixtus Senenfis fays, they were fuch as
wrought
by Covenants with Devils, but turn d to it
from their Wifdom, which was to ittidy the
practical Part of Natural Philofophy, work
ing admirable Effects by the mutual Appli*
cation of Natural Caufes.
J.
The Chartumim from being Rcafoners or
Difputers upon difficult Points in Philofophy,
became Enchanters and Conjurers. So,
4. The Mecafphim or Prophets, they turn d to
be Sorcerers, Raifers of Spirits, fuch as
wounded by an evil Eye, and by bitter Curfes,
and were afterwards fam d for having familiar
Converfe with the Devil^ and were called
Witches.
y. The Gazarim, from the bare obferving of
the good and bad Omens, by the Entrails
of Beails, flying of Birds, &c. were turn d
to Sacrifts or Priefls of the Heathen Idols
and Sacrificers.
Thus, I fay, firft or laft the Devil engrofs d
all the Wife-Men of the Eaft, for fo they are
calPd j made them all his own, and by them he
work d Wonders, that is, he filPd the World
with lying Wonders, as if wrought by thefe
Men, when indeed it was all his own, from Be
ginning to the End, and fet on Foot meerly to
propagate Delufion, impofe upon blinded and
ignorant Men j the God of this World blinded
their Minds, and they were led away by the Sub-
tilty of the Devil^ to fay no worfe of it, till
they became Devils themfelves, as to Mankind j
Z 4 for
344- The Modern HISTORY
for they carried on the Devil s Work upon all
Occafions, and the Race of them flil) continue
in other Nations, and fome of them among our
ielves, as we {hall fee prcfently.
The Arabians follow d the Chaldeans in this
Study, while it was kept within its due Bounds,
and after them the Egyptians j and among the
Latter we find that Jannes and Jambres were
famous for their leading Pharaoh by their pretend
ed magic Performances, to reject
the real Miracles
of Mofes y and Hiflory tells us of flrange Pranks
the Wife-Men, the Magicians and the Southfay-
ers plaid to delude the People in the mofl early
Ages of the World.
But, as I
fay, now, the Devil has improved
himfelf, fo he did then j for the Grecian and
Roman Heathen Rites coming on, they outdid
all the Magicians and Southfayers, by eflablifh-
jng the Devil s
lying Oracles, which, as a Maf-
ter-Piece of Hell, did the Devil more Honour,
and brought more Homage to him, than ever he
had before, or could arrive to fince.
Again,
as by the fetting up the Oracles, all the
Magicians and Southfayers grew out of Credits
fo at the ceafing of thofe Oracles, the Devil was
fain to go back to the old Game again, and take
up with the Agency of Witches, Divinations,
Inchantments and Conjurings, as I hinted before,
anfwcrable to the four Sorts mentioned in the
Story of Nebuchadnezzar, (viz.) Magicians, Af-
trokgerS) the Chaldeans and the Southfayers : How
thefe began to be out of Requeft, I have men-
tion d already; but as the Devil has not quite
given them over, only laid them afide a little for
the prefent, we may venture to ask what they
were, and what Ufe he made of them when he
did employ them.
The
345
The Truth is, I think, as it was a very mean
Employment for any thing that wears a human
Countenance to take up, fo I muft acknowledge,
I think, twas a mean low priz d Bufinefs for
Satan to take up with j below the very De
vil-, below his
Dignity as an Angelic, tho con-
demn d Creature 3 below him even as a Devil;
to go to talk to a parcel of ugly, deform d, fpite-
ful, malicious old Women 5 to give them Power
to do Mifchief, who never had a Will, after they
enter d into the State of old Pieman-Hood^ to do
any thing elfe: Why the Devil always chofe
the uglieil old Women he could find 5 whether
tFizardifm made them ugly, that were not fo
before, and whether the Ugliaefs, as it was a
Beauty in Witchcraft, did not encreafe according
to the meritorious Performance in the Black-
Trade? Thefe are all Queftions of Moment to
be decided, (if human Learning can arrive to fo
much Perfection) in Ages to come.
Some fay the evil Eye and the wicked Look
were Parts of the Enchantment, and that the
Witches, when they were in the height of their
Bufinefs, had a powerful Influence with both;
that by looking upon any Perfon they could be
witch them, and make the Devil, as the Scots
exprefs /f, ride through them booted and fpurr d $
and that hence came that very fignificant Saying,
to look like a Witch.
The flrange Work which the Devil has made
in the World, by this Sort of his Agents call d
Witches, is fuch, and fo extravagantly wild, that
except our Hope that mod of thofe Tales .happen
not to be true, I know not how any -crrie could
be eafy to live near a Widow after fhe was five
and fifty.
All the other Sorts of Emiflaries which Satan
employs, come fhort of tjiefe Ghoftsj and Appa
ritions
The Modern HISTORY
ritions fometimes come and {hew themfelves, on
particular Accounts, and fome of thole Particu
lars refpc&amp;lt;5b doing Juftice, repairing Wrongs,
preventing Mifchief j fometimes in Matters very
confiderable, and on Things fo neceflary to pub-
lick Benefit, that we are tempted to believe they
proceed from fome vigilant Spirit who wifhes us
well &amp;gt;
but on the other Hand, thefe Witches are
never concern d in any thing but Mifchief ; nay9
if what they do portends good to one, it ifTues
in hurt to many &amp;gt;
the whole Tenour of their
Life, their Defign in general, is to do Mifchief,
and they are only employ d in Mifchief, and no
thing elfe : How far they are furnifli d with Abi
lity
fuitable to the horrid Will they are veiled
with, remains to be defcrib d.
Thefe Witches, tis faid, are furnifh d with Pow
er fuitable to the Occafion that is before them,
and particularly that which deferves to be confi-
der d, as Prediction, and foretelling Events, which
I infift the Author of Witchcraft is not accom-
plifh d with himfelf, nor can he communicate it
to any other : How then Witches come to be
able to foretel Things to come, which, tis faid,
the Devil liimfelf cannot know, and which, as I
have {hewn, tis evident he does not know him-
felf, is yet to be determin d} that Witches do
foretel, is certain, from the Witch of Endor,
who foretold Things to Saul, which he knew
not before, namely, that he ihould be flain in
Battle the next Day, which accordingly came to
pafs.
There are, however, and notwithftanding this
particular Cafe, many Inflances wherein the De
vil has not been able to foretel approaching Events,
and that in Things of the utmoft Confequence,
and he has given certain foolifh or falfe Anfwers
in fuch Cafes $ the DEVJL S Priefts, which were
fummon d
of the D EVIL; 347
ftmmon d in by the
Prophet Elija, to decide the
Difpute between God and Baal, had the Devil
been able to have inform d them of it, would
certainly have received Notice from him, of what
was intended againft them by Elija 3 that is to fay,
that they would be all cut in pieces
-
y for Satan
was not fuch a Fool as not to know that Baal
was a
Non-Entity, a
Nothing, at beft a dead
Man, .penfli d and
rotting in his Grave* for Baal
was Bell or Belus anantient King of the Jffyrian
Monarchy, and he could no more anfwer by Fire
to confume the Sacrifice, than he could raifc him-
iclt from the dead.
But the Priefts of Baal were, left of their
Matter to their juft Fate, namely, to be a Sa
criface to the Fury of a deluded People; hence
infer his
Inability, for it would have been very
unkind and ungrateful in him not to have anfwer d
them, if he had been able. There is another
Argument raifed here moft juftly againft the De
vil, with Relation to his
being under Refiraint,
md that of greater Eminence than we imagine
and it is drawn from this
very PafTage, thus!
tis not to be doubted but that Satan, who has
much of the Element put into his Hands, as
Prince of the Air, had a
Power, or was able po
tentially fpeaking, to have anfwer d Waal s Prietfs
by Fire 5 Fire
being in Vertue of his airy Prin
cipality a Part of his Dominion ; but he was
certainly withheld by the Superior Hand, which
gave him that
Dominion, I mean withheld for the
Occafion only: So in another Cafe, it was plain
that
Balaam, who was one of thofe Sorts of
Chaldeans mentioned above, who dealt in Divi
nations and
Inchantments, was withheld from curf-
ing Ifrael.
Some are of Opinion that Balaam was not a
Witch or a Deafer with the Devil, becaufe tis
348 The Modern HISTORY
faid of him, or rather he fays it of himfelf, that
he faw the Vifions of God, Numb. xxiv. \6.
He hath faid) who heard the IVords of GOD, and
knew the Knowledge of the moft High, which faw
the Vifions of the Almighty, faUinginto TRANCE,
but having his Eyes open : Hence uiey alledge he
was one of thofe Magi, which St. Auguftin
fpeaks of, de Divinatione^ who by the Study of
Nature, and by the Contemplation of created
Beings came to the Knowledge of the Crea
ture j and that Balaam s Fault was, that being
tempted by the Rewards and Honours that the
King promifed him, he intended to have curs d If-
raeh, but when his Eyes were open d, and that he
law they were God s own People, he durfl not
do it 5 they will have it therefore, that except,
as above, Balaam was a good Man, or at leaft
that he had the Knowledge of the true God,
and the Fear of that God upon him, and that
he honeftly declares this. Numb. xxii. 18. If
Balak would give me his Houfe full of Silver and
Gold, I cannot go beyond the Word of the Lord
MY GOD : Where tho he is calPd a falfe Pro
phet by fome, he evidently owns God, and af-
fumes a Property in him, as other Prophets did ;
MY GOD, and I cannot go beyond his Orders^
but that which gives me a better Opinion of Ba
laam than all this is, his plain Prophefy of Chrift,
Chap. xxiv. 17. where he calls him the Star of
Jacob) and declares, I jhall fee him, but not now,
I Jhall behold him, but not nigh 5 there Jhall come
a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter Jhall rife out
of Ifrael, and Jhall fmite the Corners of Moab,
and dejlroy all the Children of Seth, all which
cxprefs not a Knowledge only, but a Faith in
Chrift} but I have done preaching, this is all
by the by, I return to my Bufincfsa which is the
Therq
of the DEVI t: 349
There is another Piece of dark Pra&ice here,
which lies between Satan and his particular
Agents, and which they mult give us an Anfwer
to, when they can, which I think will not be
in hafte j and that is about the obfequious Devil
fubmitting to be call d up into Vifibility,
whenever an old Woman has her Hand crofs d
with a white Six-pence, as they Call it : One
would think that inilead of thefe vile Things
call d Witches, being fold to the Devily the De
vil was really fold for a Slave to them &amp;gt;
for how
far foever Satan s Refidence is off of this State
of Life, they have Power, it feems, to fetch
him from home, and oblige him to come at their
Call.
I can give little Account of this, only that
indeed fo it is j nor is the Thing fo ftrange in its
felf, as the Methods to do it are mean, foolifh,
and ridiculous &amp;gt;
as making a Circle and dancing in
it, pronouncing fuch and fuch Words, faying
the Lord s
Prayer backward, and the like $ now
is this agreeable to the Dignity of the Prince of
the Air or Atmofphere, that he fhould be command
ed forth with no more Pomp or Ceremony than
that of muttering a few Words, fuch as the old
Witches and he agree about ? or is there fome-
thing elfe in it, which none of us or themfelves
underftand ?
Perhaps, indeed, he is
always with thofe Peo
ple call d Witches and Conjurers, or at lead:
ibme of his Camp Volant are always prefent, and
fo upon the leaft call of the Wizard, it is but
putting off the mifty Cloak and Showing them
felves.
Then we have a Piece of mock Pageantry in
bringing thofe Things call d witches or Conju
rers to Juftice, that is, firft to know if a Wo

CHAP. X.
Of the various Methods the Devil takes
to converfe with Mankind.
HAving
fpoken fomething of Perfons, and
particularly
of fuch as the Devil thinks fit
to employ in his Affairs in the World, it comes
next of courfc to fay fomething of the Manner
how he communicates his Mind to them, and
by them to the reft of his Acquaintance in the
World.
I take the Devil to be under great Difficul
ties in his Affairs on his Part, efpecially occa-
fion d by the Bounds which are fet him, or which
Policys oblige him to fet to himfelf, in his Ac-
cefs to the converfing with Mankind ; tis evi
dent he is not permitted to fall upon them with
Force and Arms, that is to fay, to mufter up his
infernal Troops, and attack them with Fire and
Sword j if he was not loofe to aft in this Manner
as he was able, by his 9wn feraphic Power to
j have
of the DEVIL; 353
have deftroy d the whole Race, and even the
Earth they dwelt upon, fo he would certainly,
and long ago have effectually done it ; his parti*-
cular Interefts and Inclinations are well enough
known.
But in the next Place, as he is thus reftrain d
from Violence, fo Prudentials reftrain him in all
his other Actings with Mankind 5 and being con*
fin d to Stratagem, and fdft ftill Methods, fuch
as Perfuafion, Allurement, feeding the Appetite,
prompting, and then gratifying corrupt Defires,
and the like &amp;gt;
he finds it for his Purpofe not to
appear in Perfon, except very rarely, and then in
Difguife &amp;gt;
but to ab all the reft in the Dark, un
der the Vizor of Art and Craft, making Ufe of
Perfons and Methods conceal d, or at leaft not
fully underftood or difcover d.
As to the Perfons whom he employs, I have
taken fome Pains you fee to difcover fome of them ;
but the Methods he ufes with them, either to
inform and inftriict, and give Orders to them,
or to converfe with other People by them, thefeare
very particular,
and deferve fome Place in our
Memoirs, particularly
as
they may ferve to remove
fome of our Miflakes, and to take off fome of
the frightful Ideas we are apt to entertain in Pre
judice of this great Manager j as if he was no
more to be match d in his Politics, than he would
be to be match d in his Power, if it was let
loofe 5 which is fo much a Miftake, that on the
contrary, we read of feveral People that have
abufed and cheated the Devil, a Thing, which
I cannot fay, is
very honeft nor juft,
notwith-
ftanding the old Latin Proverb, Falkre fallentem
non eft fraus, (which Mert conftrtie, or rather
i-ender, by way of Banter upon Satan) tis no Sin
to cheat the Devil, which for all that, upon the
whole I deny, and alledge, that let the Devil
A a aft
354 The M^mzHISTORY
ad how he will by us, we ought to deal fairly
by him.
But to come to the Bufmefs, without Cir
cumlocutions &amp;gt;
I am to enquire how Satan iflues
out his Orders, gives his Inftruftions and fully
delivers his Mind to his Emiflaries, of whom I
have mention d fome in the Title to Chap. IX.
In order to this, you muft form an Idea of the
Devil fitting in great State, in open Campaign,
with all his Legions about him, in the height of
the Atmofpherej or if you will, at a certain Di-
ftancc from the Atmofphere, and above it, that
the Plan of his Encampment might not be hur
ried round its own Axis, with the Earth s di
urnal Motion, which might be fome Difturbance
to him.
By this fix d Situation, the Earth performing
its
Rotation, he has every Part and Parcel of it
brought to a diredk Opposition to him, and con-
fequently to his View once in twenty four Hours:
The laft time I was there, if I remember right,
he had this Quarter of the World, which we
call Chriftendom, juft under his Eye &amp;gt;
and as
the Motion is not fo fwift, but that his piercing
Opticks can take a ftrift View of it tnfaffant}
for the Circumference of it
being but twenty
one thoufand Miles, and its circular Motion being
full twenty four Hours performing, he has fome-
thing more than an Hour to view every thou
fand Miles, which, to his fupernatural Penetration,
is not worth naming.
As he takes thus a daily View of all the Cir
cle, and an hourly View of the Parts, he is fully
Mafter of all Tranfaftions, at leaft fuch as are
done above Board by all Mankind j and then he
difpatches his Emiffaries or Aid du Camps to every
Part with his Orders and Inftruftions : Nowthefe
Emiflaries, you are to underftand, are not the
Witch*
of the DEVIL. 555
Witches and Diviners, who I
fpoke of above, for
I call them allb Emiflaries 5 but they are all
Devils or (as you know they are call cl) Devil s
Angels 5 and theie may, perhaps, come and con-
verfe
perfonally with the Sub-em ifTaries I men-
tion d,to be ready for their
Support and Affiftance
on all Occafions of Bufinefs: Thefe are thofc De
vils which the Witches are faid to raifej for we
can hardly fuppofe the Matter Devil comes him-
felf, at the Summons of every ugly old Woman.
Thefe run about into
every Nook and Corner,
wherever Satan s Bufinefs calls them, and are
never wanting to him -,
but are the moil diligent:
Devih imaginable 5 like the Turkijh Chaiux, they
no fooner receive their Errand, but they execute
it with the utmoft Alacrity ; and as to their
Speed,
it
may be truly written as a Motto, upon the
Head of every individual Devil,
Non indiget calcarlbus.
Thefe are thofe, who they tell us our Witches,
Sorcerers, Wizards, and fuch Sorts of Folks con-
verfe freely with, and are therefore call d their
FamiliarS y and as
they tell us, come to them in
human Shapes, talk to theift with articulate plain
Voices, as if Men, and that yet the faid Witches,
&fr. know them to be Devils.
Hiftory has not yet enlighten d us in this Part
of ufeful
Knowledge, or at lean: not fufficiently
for a Defcription of the Perfons or Habits of
thefe Sorts of Appearances 5 as what Shapes they
take up, what Language they fpeak, and what
particular Works they perform, fo we mutt re
fer k to farther Enquiry; but if we may cre
dit
Hiftory, we are told many famous Stones of
thefe
Appearances 5 for Example, the famous
Mother Lakland^ who was burnt for a Witch
A a & at
35* The Modern HISTORY
at Ipfwicb) Anno 164(5, confefTed at the Time of
her Execution, or a little before it, that ihe had
frequent Converfation with the Devil himfelf j
that ihe being very poor, and withal of a devi-
lifhpaflionate, cruel and revengeful Difpofition be
fore, ufed to wiih fhe had it in her Power to do
ftich and fuch mifchievous Things to fome that
fhe hated j and that the Devil himfelf, who, it
feems, knew her Temper, came to her one
Night
as ihe lay in her Bed$ and was between fleeping
and waking, and fpeaking in a deep hollow
Voice, told her j if ihe would ferve him in fome
Things he would employ her to do, ihe ihould
have her Will of all her Enemies, and fhould
want for nothing: That ihe was much afraid at
firftj but that he folliciting her very often, bad
her not be afraid of him, and ftill
urg d her to
yield, and as ihe fays, ftruck his Claw into her
Hand, and tho it did not hurt her, made it bleed,
and with the Blood wrote the Covenants, that is
to fay, the Bargain between them :
being ask d
what was in them, and whether he required her
to curfe or deny God or Chrift ? She faid no.
N. B. I do not find ihe told them whether
the Devil wrote it with a Pen, or whether
on Paper or Parchment, nor whether ihe
fign d it or no, but it feems he carry d it a-
way with him. I
fuppofe, if Satan s Re-
gifter were examin d, it
might be found a-
mong the Archives of Hell, the Rolls of his
affa PuUlca ; and when his Hiffcoriographer
Royal publiflies them, we may look for it
among them.
Then he furniih d her with three Z)w;7r,to wait
Upon her (I fuppofe) for ihe confefs d they were
to be employ d in her Service &amp;gt;
they attended in
the Shapes of two little Dogs and a Mole: The

firft
of the DEVIL: $$?
firft flie bewitched was her own Husband, by
which he lay a while in great Mifery and died j
then fhe fent to one Captain Beal and burnt a
new Ship of his juft built, which had never been
at Sea 5 thefe and many other horrid Things fhe
did and confefs d, and having been twenty Years
a Witch, at lafl the Devil left her, and fhe was
burnt as fhe deferv d.
That fome extraordinary Occafions may bring
thefe Agents of the Devil, nay, fometimes the
Devil himfelf, to afTume human Shapes, and ap
pear to other People we cannot doubt &amp;gt;
he did thus
in the Cafe of our Saviour as a fempter^ and fome
think he did fo to Manaffes as a Familiar, who
the Scripture charges with Sorcery, and having a
Familiar or Devil &amp;gt;
Fame tells us that St. Dunflan
frequently convcrft with him, and finally, took
him by the Nofe , and fo of others.
But in thefe modern Ages of the World, he
finds it much more to his Purpofe to work under
Ground as I have obferv d, and to keep upon
the Rcfervej fo that we have no authentick Ac
counts of his perfonal Appearance, but what are
very antient or very remote from our Faith, as
well as our Enquiry.
It feems to be a Queflion that would bear fome
debating, whether all
Apparitions are not Devils
or from the Devil j but there being fo many of
thofe Apparitions which we call Spirits, which
really aflame Shapes and make Appearances in
the World, upon fuch Accounts as we know
Satan himfelf (corns to be employed in, that I
mufl difmifs the Queftion in favour of the Devil}
afTuring them, that as he never willingly did any
food
in his Life, fo he would be far from giving
imfelf the Trouble of fettihg one Foot into the
World, on fuch an Errand; and for that Reafon
we maybe aflur d thofe certain Apparitions, which
A a 3 we
358 The Modern HIST DRY
we are told came to detect a Murther in Gkucejter-
Jbire,
and others who appear d to prevent the ru
ining an Orphan for want of finding a Deed, that
was not loft, was certainly fome other Power equal
ly concerned, and riot the Devil*
On the other Hand, neither will it follow that
Satan never appears in human Shape 5 for tho
every Apparition may no* be the Devil, yet it
does not follow that the Devil never makes an
Apparition : All I {hall fay to it is, as I have men-
t ion d before, that generally fpeaking, the Devil
finds it. more for his Purpofe, to have his Tntereft
In the World propagated another Way &amp;gt;
namely,
in private, and his peribnal Appearances are re-
ferv d for Things only of extraordinary Confe-
quence, and, as I may fay, of evident Neceffity,
where his Honour is conccViVd, and where his Inte
l-eft could be carried on no other Way 5 not for
getting
to take Notice that this is
very feldom.
It remains to enquire, what then thofe Things
are which we make fo much ftir about, and
which are call d Apparitions, or Spirits afiiim-
ing human Shapes, and {hewing themfelves to
People on particular Occafions? whether they are
evil Spirits or good ? and tho , indeed, this is out
pf my Way at this Time, and does not relate at
all to the DeviFs Hiftory, yet I thought it not
amifs to mention it , (i.) Becaqfe^ as I have (aid,
1 do not wholly exclude Satan from all Concern
in fuch Things j and (i.) Becaufe-4-{hall difmifs
the Quellion with fo very fhort an Anfwerj
namely, that we may determine which are and
which.are not the Devil s, by the Errand they come
upon 5 every one to his own Bufmefs; if it comes
of a good Errand, you may certainly acquit the
ijDtatf/
of it, conclude him innocent, and that he
has no hand in it 5 if it comes of a wicked and
deviliih Errand, you may e en take him up upon
Su(picion?
of the D E VI L: 359
Sufpicion, tis ten to one but you find him at the
Bottom of it.
Next to Apparitions, we find Mankind difturb d
by abundance of little odd referv d Ways which
the Devil is
fhrewdly fufpefted of having a Hand
in, fuch as Drearns, Nozfes, Voices&amp;gt;
8cc. fmells of
Brimftone, Candles burning blue, and the like.
As to Dreams, I have nothing to fay in Satan s
Prejudice at all there &amp;gt;
I make no Queftion but
he deals very much in that Kind of Intelligence,
and why fhould he not ? we know Heaven it felf
formerly converft very often with the greater! of
Aden, by the fame Method, and the Devil is
known to mimick the Methods, as well as the
Actions of his Maker &amp;gt;
whether Heaven has not
quite left off that Way of working, we are
not certain &amp;gt;
but we pretty well know the Devil
has not left it, and I believe fome Inftances may
be given where his Worfhip has been really feen
and talk d to in fleep, as much as if the Pcrfon
had been awake with his Eyes open.
Thefe are to be diftinguifh d too, pretty much
by the Goodnefs or Badnefs of the Subject
-
y how
often have Men committed Murther, Robbery
and Adultery in a Dream, and at the fame time
except an extraordinary Agitation of the Soul,
and exprefs d by extraordinary Noifes in the
Sleep, by violent Sweating and other fuch Ways,
the Head has never been remov d from the Pillow,
or the Body fo much as turn d in the Bed ?
Whether in fuch Cafes, the Soul with all the
Paffions and Affections being agitated,
and giving
their full affent to the Facts, of whatever Kind
foever, the Man is not as guilty as if the Sins fo
dream d of his committing, had been actually
committed ? tho it be no Doubt to me, but that
it is fo, yet as it is foreign to the prefent Affair,
uncj not at all relating to the Devil s Hiftory5
I
A a .
166 The Modern HISTORY
leave it to the Reverend Doftors of the Church,
as
properly belonging to them to decide.
I knew a Perfon who the Devil fo haunted
with naked Women, fine beautiful Ladies in
Bed with him, and Ladies of his Acquaintance
too, offering their Favours to him, and all in hi$
Sleep 3 fo that he feldom flept without fome fuch
Entertainment 3 the Particulars are too grofs for
my Story, but he gave me feveral long Accounts
of his Night s Amours^ and being a Man of a
virtuous Life and good Morals, it was the great-
eft Surprize to him imaginable 3 for you cannot
doubt but that the cunning Devil made every
thing be a&amp;lt;5bed to the Life with him, and in a
manner the moft wicked 3 he own d with Grief to
me, that the very firft Attack the Devil made upon
him, was with a very beautiful Lady ofhis Acquain
tance, who he had been really fomething freer than
ordinary with in their common Converfation *
This Lady he brought to him in a Pofture for
Wickednefs, and wrought up his Inclination fo
high in his Sleep, that he, as he thought, a6tu~
ally went about to debauch her, {he not at all
refitting 3 but that he wak d in the very Moment^
p his particular Satisfaction.
He was greatly concerned at this Part, namely,
that he really gave the Confent of his Will to the
Faci, and wanted to know if he was not as guilty
of Adultery, as if he had lain with her 3 indeed he
decided the Queftion againft himfelf, fo forcibly,
that I, who was of the fame Opinion before, had
nothing to fay againft it 3 however, I confirmed
fairn in it, by asking him thefe Queftions.
$. Whether he did not think the Devil had
the chief Hand in fuch a Dream? he an-
fwer d, it could certainly be no body elfr?

of the DEVIL:
2. I then ask d him what Reafon the Devil
could have for it, if his Confent to the Fa6b
in Sleep had not been criminal ? That s true
indeed^ fays he, / am anfwer d : But then he
ask d another Queflion, which, I confefs, is
not fo eafy to anfwer, namely, How he fhould
prevent being ferv d fo
again.
Nor could all
my Divinity or his own keep the
Devil from attacking him again 5 on the other
Hand, as I have faid, he worried him to that De
gree, that he injur d his Health, bringing naked
Women to him, fometimes one, fometimes ano
ther, fometimes in one Poflure of Lewdnefs, fome
times in another, fometimes into his very Arms,
fometimes with fuch Additions as I am not mer
ry enough, and fometimes fuch as I am not wick
ed enough to put into your Heads 3 the Man,
indeed, could not help it, and fo the Devil was
more Faulty than he j but as I hinted to him, he
might bring his Mind to fuch a ftated Habit of
Virtue, as to prevent its
aflenting to any wick
ed Motion, even in Sleep, and that would be
the Way to put an End to the Attempt; and this
Advice he reliftfd very well, and pra&ifed, I be
lieve, with Succefs.
y this fame Method, the fame Devil injects
powerful Incentives to other Crimes, provokes
Avarice, by laying a great Quantity of Gold in
your View, and no body prefcnt, giving you an
Opportunity to fteal it, or fome of it, at the fame
time, perhaps, knowing your
Circumflances to
be fuch as that you are at that Time in a great
want of the Money.
I knew another, who being a Tradefman, and
in great Diftrefs for Money in his Bufinefs,
drcam d that he was walking all alone in a great
Wood?
and that he met a little Child with a Bag
of Gold in its Hand, and a fine Necklace of
Diamonds
36i The Modern HISTORY
Diamonds on its Neck, upon the Sight, his
Wants prefently dictated to him to rob the Child 5
the little innocent Creature, (juft fo he dream d)
not being able to refift j or to tell who it was, ac
cordingly he confented to take the Money from
the Child, and then to take the Diamond Neck
lace from it too, and did fo.
But the Devil) (a full
Teflimony, as I told him,
that it was the Devil, not contented with that,
hinted to him, that perhaps the Child might fome
time or other know him, and {Ingle him out, by
crying or pointing, or fome fuch Thing, efpeci-
ally if he was fufpe&ed and ihew d to it, and
therefore it would be better for him to kill the
Child, prompting him to kill it for his own
Safety, and that he need do no more but twift
the Neck of it a little, or crufli it with his Knee 5
He told me he flood debating with himfelf, whe
ther he ftiould do fo or not &amp;gt;
but that in that In-
ilant his Heart {truck him with the Word Mur-
ther, and he entertain d a Horror of it, refus d to
do it, and immediately waked.
He told me, that when he wak d, he found
himfelf in fo violent a Sweat as he never had
known the like 5 that his Pulfe beat with that
Heat and Rage, that it was like a Palpitation of
the Heart to him, and that the Agitation of his
Spirits was fuch, that he was not fully compo
led in fome Hours $ tho the Satisfaction and Joy
that attended him, when he found it was but a
Dream, affifted much to return his Spirits to
their due Temperament.
It is neither my Bufinefs or Inclination to turn
Divine here, nor is the Age I write to Effici
ently Grave to relifti a Sermon, if I was difpofed
to preach, though they muft allow the Subject
would very well bear it j but I {hall only ask
if
they think this is not the Devil, what
they
tftbe DEVIL;
they think it is ? If they believe it is the Devil9
they will ab accordingly I hope, or let it
alone,
as Satan and they can agree about it.
I fhould not oblige the Devil over much, what
ever I might do to thofe that read it j if I
fhould enter here upon a Debate of Interefts,
(viz.) to enquire whether the Devil has not a
vail Advantage upon Mankind this
Way, and
whether it is not much his Intereft to preferve it $
and if I prove the Affirmative, I leave it to you
to enquire whofe Intereft it is to difappoint and
iiipplant him.
In fhort, I take Dreams to be the fecond Beft
of the Advantages the Devil has over Mankind 5
the fir ft, I fuppofe, you all know (viz.) the
Treachery of the Garrifon within ; by Dreams
he may be faid to get into the Infide of us with
out Oppofition 5 here he opens and locks with
out a Key, and like an Enemy laying fiege to a
fortified City, Reafon and Nature, the Governor
of the City, keep him out by Day, and keep
the Garrifon true to their Duty 5 but in the Dark
he gets in and parlees with the Garrifon (the Af-
fe&ions and Paffions) Debauches their Loyalty,
flirring up them to Difloyalty and Rebellion, fo
they betray their Truft, Revolt, Mutiny, and go
over to the Befieger.
Thus he manages his Intereft, I fay, and infi-
nuates himfelf into the Infide of us, without our
Confent, nay, without our Knowledge &amp;gt;
for
whatever Speculation may do, tis evident De-
monflration does not affift us to difcover which
Way he gets Accefs to the Soul, while the Or
gan tied up, and dozed with Sleep has lock d it
up from A6tion$ that it is fo is clear, but how
he does it is a Secret which I do not find the
Antients or Moderns have yet made a Difcovery of.
That;
The Modern HISTORY
That Devil of a Creature, Mother
whofe Story I mentioned above, acknowledged
that the firft Time the Devil attempted to draw
her in to be a Witch was in a Dream, and even
when {he confented, {he faid, {he was between
fleeping and waking 5 that is, Hie did not know
whether flie was awake or afleep, and the cun
ning Devil it feems was fatisfied with her Aflent
given fo, when {he was afleep, or neither afleep
or awake, fo taking the Advantage of her Inca
pacity to a&amp;lt;5b

The Stories of her bewitching feveral People,
and the manner in which they died, are fo formi
dable and extravagant, that I care not to put any
one s Faith to the ftretch about them, tho pub-
lilh d by Authority, and teftified by Abundance
of Witnefles ; but this is recorded in particular, and
to my Purpofe, whether from her own Mouth or
not, I do not fay, namely, the Defcription of a
Witch, and the Difference between Witches,
and thofe other of Satan s
Acquaintance who aft
in his Name,
1. They have confulted and covenanted with a
Spirit or Devil.
2. They have a Deputy Devil^ fometimes feve
ral to (erve and afliit them.
3. Thefe they employ as they pleafe, call them
by Name, and command their
Appearance in
whatever Shape they think fit.
4. They fend them abroad to or into the Per-
fons who they defign to bewitch, who they
always torment, and often murther them, as
Mother Lakland did feveral.
As to the Difference between the feveral De
vils that appear, it relates to the Office of the
Perfons who employ thqm j as Conjurers, who
feem
df the t) E V I L:
fcern to command the particular Devil that waits
upon them with more Authority, and raife them
and lay them at Pleafure, drawing Circles, cafting
Figures, and the like ; but the Witch, in a more
familiar manner, whifpers with the Devil, keeps
the Devil in a Bag or a Sack, fometimes in her
Pocket, and the like, and like Mr. Faux fhews
Tricks with him.
But all thefe Kinds deal much in Dreams, talk
with the Devil in their Sleep, and make other
People talk with him in their Sleep too ; and tis
on this Occafion I mention it here ; in fhort, the
Devil may well take this Opportunity with Man
kind, for not half the World that came into his
Meafures would comply, if they were awake j
but of that hereafter.
And yet his thus insinuating himfelf by Dream,
does not feem fufficient, in my Opinion, toanfwer
the Devil s End, and to carry on his Bufinefs j and
therefore we muft be forced to allow him a Kind
of actual PofTeflion, in particular Cafe?, and that
in the Souls of fome People, by different Methods
from others 5 Luther is of the Opinion that
the Devil gets a Familiarity with fome Souls
juft at, or rather before their being embodied 5
as to the Manner and Method how he gets in,
that is another Qucftion, and may be fpoken of
by it felf j befides, why may not he, that at
Satan s
Requeft to enter into the Herd of Swine,
faid 0, give the fame Commiflion to poilefs a
fort of Creatures fo many Degrees below the
Dignity of the Gaderenian Swine, and open the
Door too ? but as for that, when our Lord faid
g0, the Devil never enquired which Way he ihould
get in.
When then I fee Nations, or indeed Herds of
Nations fet on Fire of Hell, and as I may fay,

tis
enough to me that the great Matter of
the Devils has faid to him, GO&amp;gt;
there s no need to
enquire which Way he finds open, or at what
poitern Gate he gets in j as to his appearing,
tis
plain he often gets in without appearing, and
therefore the Queftion about his appearing ftill
remains a Doubt, and is not very eafy to be re-
folv d.
In the Scripture we have fome Light into it,
and that is all the Help I find from Antiquity^
and it
goes a great Way to folve the Phenomena of
Satan s
appearing $ what I mean by the Scripture
giving fome Light to it, is this &amp;gt;
tis faid in feve-
ral Places, and of feveral Perfons, God came to
them in a Dream, Gen. xx. j.
God came to Abi-
mejcch in a Dream by Night^ Gen. xxxi. 14. And
God came to Laban the Syrian in a Dream^ Matt,
ii.
13. The Angel of the Lord appeared to
Jofeph
in a Dream-, fhort Comments are fufficient to
plain Texts, applying this to my Friend when he
wanted to be facisfied about the How, relating
to his Dream (viz.) how he fhould come to Dream
fuch wicked Things? J told him, in fhort, the
Cafe was plain, the Devil came to him in a Dream
try Night : How and in what manner he form d
the wicked Reprefentations, and fpread debaucrTd
Appearances before his Fancy, by real Whifpers
and Voice, according to Milton, or by what other
Methods, the Learned are not arriv d to any Cer
tainty about it.
This leads me neceflarily to enquire whether
the Devil or fome of his Agents are not always
in our Company, whether they make any vifible
Appearances or no ? For my Part I make no Que
flion of it, how elie could he come at the Know
ledge of what we do j for as I can allow him no
Prcfcience at all, as for many Reafons I have ob-
j f j
fervd
*f tt&amp;gt;e DEVIL:
ferv d already, he mufl be able to fee and know
us, and what we are about when we know
nothing of him, or elfe he could know nothing of
us and our Affairs ,
which yet we find otherwife $
and this gives him infinite Advantage to Influ
ence our Actions, to judge of our Inclinations,
and to bring our Paffions to clafh with our Rea-
fon, as they often do, and get the better of it too.
All this he obtains by his being able to walk
about invisible, and fee when he is not feen, of
which I have fpoken already j hence that moil
wife and folid Suggestion, that when the Candles
burn blue the Devil is in the Room, which
great Secret in Nature, that you may more fully
be convinc d of its
imaginary Reality, I muft tell
you the following Story which I faw in a Letter
directed to a particular Friend, take it Word for
Word as in the Letter j becaufe I do not make
my felf accountable for the Fads, but take them
ad referendum.
SIR,
WE had one Day, very early in the Morn
ing, and for the moil Part of the Day a
great deal of Rain with a high Wind, and the
Clouds very thick and dark all Day.
In the Evening the cloudy thick Weather con
tinued, tho not the Rain, when being at a Friend s
Houfe in Lane London^ and feveral Ladies
and fome Gentlemen in the Room, belides two
or three Servants (for we had been eating) the fol
lowing Interlude happen d for our Entertainment :
When the Cloth was taken away, two large Can
dles were brought upon the Table and plac d
there with fome Bottles and GlafTes for the Gen
tlemen, who, it feems, were intending to drink
and be very merry j two large Wax-Candles were
a alfo
5 68 The MotternHIS TORY
alfo fet on another Table, the Ladies being going
to Cards, alfo there were two large Candles in
Sconces over or near the Chimney, and one more
in a Looking-Glafs Sconce, on a Peer by the
Window.
With all this Apparatus^ the Company feparat-
ing fat down, the Gentlemen at their Table, and
the Ladies at theirs, to play as above; when after
fome time the Gentleman of the Houfe faid ha-
flily to a Servant, what a P ails the Candles ?
and turning to the Servant raps out an Oath or
two, and bids him fnitff the Candles^ for they
burnt as if the Devil was in the Room.
The Fellow going to fnurF one of the Candles,
(huffs it out, at which his Mafter
being in a Paf-
fion the Fellow lights it
again immediately at the
other Candle, and then being in a little
hurrfr,
going to fnurF the other Candle fnuffed that out
too.
The firft Candle that was relighted (as is ufual
in fuch Cafes) burn d dim and dull for a good
while, and the other being out, the Room was
much darker than before, and a Wench that
flood by the Ladies Table, bawls out to her Mif-
trefs, Law Madam! the Candles burn blue; an
old Lady that fat by fays, ay Betty ! fo they do j
upon this one of the Ladies flans up, Mercy upon
us, fays flie, what is the Matter! In this unlucky
Moment another Servant, without Orders, went
to the great Peer Sconce, and becaufe, as he
thought, he would be fure to fnuff the Candle
well, he offers to take it down, but very unhap
pily, I fay, the Hook came out and down falls the
Sconce Candle and all, and the Looking-Glafs
broke all to pieces, with a horrible Noifej how
ever, the Candle falling out of the Sconce
did not go out, but lay on the Floor burning
dully, and as it is ufual on fuch Cafes, all on one
Side,
of the DEVIL: 369
Side, Betty cries out again. Law Madam^ that
Candle burns blue too j the very Moment fhe
faid -this, the Footman that had thrown down
the Sconce, fays to his fellow Servant, that came
to his Affiftance, I think the Devil is in the Candles
to Night, and away he run out of the Room, for
fear of his Mailer.
The old Lady, who, upon the Maid Betty s
Notion of the Candles burning blue, had her
Head jiift
full of that old Chimney-Corner Story ,
the Candles burn blue when the Spirits are in the
Room, heard the Footman fay the Word Devil,
but heard nothing elfe of what he faid 5 upon this
fhe rifes up in a terrible Fright, and cries out that
the Footman faid the Devil was in the Room 5 as
fhe was$ indeed, frighted out of her Wits, fhe
frighted the Ladies moft terribly, and they all
ftarting up together, down goes the Card Table,
and put the Wax- Candles out.
Mrs. Betty^ that had frighted them all, runs
to the Sconce next the Chimney, but that hav
ing a long Snuff, fhe cried out it burnt blue too,
and fhe durft not touch it
-
y in fhort, tho there
were three Candles left Hill
burning in the Room,
yet the Ladies were all fo frighted, that they and
the Maids too run out of the Parlour fcreaming
like mad Folks. The Matter in a Rage kick d
his firft Man out of the Room, and the fecond
Man was run out to avoid, as I faid before, the
like, fo that no Servant was to be had, but all
was in Confufion.
The two other Gentlemen, who were fitting at
the firft Table, kept their Seats compofed and
cafy enough, only concerned to fee all the Houfe
in fuch a frights it was true, they faid, the Can
dles burnt dim and very oddly, but they could
hot perceive they burnt blue, except one of thofe
over the Chimney, and that on the Table, which
B b was
370 The Modern HISTORY
was relighted after the Fellow had frmfFt it
out.
However, the Maid, the old Lady and the
Footman that pull d down the Sconce, all infill
that the Candles burnt blue^ and all
pretend that
the Devil was certainly in the Room, and was the
Occafion of it j and they now came to me with
the Story, to deiire my Opinion of it.
This put me upon Enquiry into the Notion
of Candles burning blue when Spirits are in a
Room, which upon all the Search into
Things,
that I am able to make, amounts to no more than
thisj that upon any extraordinary Emiffion of
fulphureous or of nitrous Particles, either in a clofe
Room, or in any not very open Place, if the
Quantity be great, a Candle or Lamp, or any
fuch little Blaze of Fire will feem to be, or to
burn blue j and if then they can prove that any
fuch Effluvia attends or is emitted from a Spirit,
then when SATAN is at Hand it
may be fo.
But then tis
begging the Queftion grofsly, be-
caufe no Man can aflure us that the Devil has
any fulphureous Particles about him.
It is
true, the Candles burn thus in Mines and
Vaults, and damp Places ; and tis as true that
they will do fo upon Occafion of very damp,
ilormy and moift A&quot;*3 when an extraordinary
Quantity of Vapours are fuppofed to be difpers d
abroad, as was the Cafe when this
happen d j and if
there was any Thing of that in it on that Monday
Night, the Candles might, perhaps, burn blue
upon that Occafion 5 but that the Devil was
abroad upon any extraordinary Bufinfes that Night,
that I cannot grant, unlefs I have fome better
TefHmony than the old Lady that heard the Foot
man s
out-cry but by halves, or than Mrs. Betty^
who firft fancied the Candles burnt blue j fo I
muft fufpend my Judgment till I hear farther.
This
of the DEVIL; 37l
This Story however may folve a great many of
thofe Things which pafs for Apparitions in the
World, and which are laid to the Devil s
Charge,
tho he really may know nothing of the Matter $
and this would bring me to defend Satan in many
Things, wherein he may truly be faid to fuffer
wrongfully &amp;gt;
and if I thought it would oblige
him, I might fay fomething to his Advantage
this Way j however, Til venture a Word or
two for an injur d Devil^ take it as you will.
Firft, it is
certain, that as thislnviiibility of the
Devil is very much to our Prejudice, fo the Doc
trine of his Vifibility is a great Prejudice to him,
as we make Ufe of it.
By his Invifibility he is
certainly vefted with
infinite Advantages againft us -,
while he can be
prefent with us, and we know nothing of the
Matter, he informs himfelf of all our Mcafures,
and arms himfelf in the beft and moft fuitable
manner to injure and aflault us, as he can counter
act all our fecret concerted Defigns, difappoint all
our Schemes, and except when Heaven apparent
ly concerns it felf to over-rule him, can defeat all
our Enterprises, break all our Meafures, and do
us Mifchief in almoft every Part of our Life, and
all this, becaufe we are not privy to all his Mo
tions, as he is to ours.
But now for his Vifibility and his real Appear
ance in the World, and particularly among his
Difciples and Emiflaries, fuch as Witches and
Wizards, Demonaifts, and the like :
Here, I think
Satan has a great deal of Lofs, fuffers manifeft
Injury, and has great Injuftice done him $ and,
that therefore I ought to clear this Matter up a
little, if it be poffible, to do Juftice to Satan, and
fet Matters right in the World about him, accord
ing to that ufeful old Maxim of fetting the Saddle
upon the right Horfe, or giving the Devil his due.
B b i Pirft,
The Modem H I S f O R Y
Firft, as I have faid) we are not to believe
every idle Head, who pretends even to converfc
Face to Face with the Devil) and who tells us,
they have thus feen him, and been acquainted
with him- every Day :
Many of thefe Pretenders
are imnifeft Cheats 5 and, however, they would
have the Honour of a private Interest in him, and
boaft how they have him at their Beck, can call
him this Way, and fend him that, as they pleafe,
raife him and lay him when and how, and as often
as they find for their Purpofe 5 I fay, whatever
Boafls they make of this Kind, they really have
nothing of Truth in them.
Now the Injuries and Injufticedone to theZV*
vil) in thefe Cafes, are manifeft j namely, that
they entitle the Devil to all the Mifchief they
are pleated to do in the World 5-
and if they
commit a Murther or a Robbery, fire a Houfe,
or do any A6b of Violence in the World, they
prciently&quot;
are laid to do it
by the Agency of theZ&amp;gt;^
vi!) and the Devil helps them &amp;gt;
fo Satan bears the
Reproach, and they have all the Guilts this is,
(i.) a grand Cheat upon the World, and (2.) a
notorious Slander upon the Devil &amp;gt;
and it would
be a public Benefit to Mankind, to have fuch would-
be-Devils as thefe turn d infide out, that we might
know when the Devil was really at work among
us, and when not ; what Mifchiefs were of his
doing, and which were not 5 and that thefe Fel
lows might not flip their Necks out of the Hal
ter, by continually laying the Blame of their
Wickednefs upon the Devil.
Not that the Devil is not very willing to have
his Hand in any Mifchkf, or in all the Mifchief
that rs done in the World -
9 but there are fomelow
priz d Rogueries that are too little for him, be
neath the Dignity of his Operation, and which
tis
really a Scandal to the Devil to charge upon
him*
of the DEVIL: 37$
turn. I remember the Devil had fuch a Cheat
put upon him in Eaft-Smithfield once, where a
Perfon pretended to converfe with the Devil Face
to Face, and that in
open Day too, and to
caufe him to tell Fortunes, foretel Good and
Evil, &c. dilcover ftollen Goods, tell where
they were who Hole them, and how to find
them again, nay, and even to find out the Thieves j
but Satan was really flandered in the Cafe, the
Fellow had no more to do with the Devil than
other People, and perhaps not fo much neither:
This was one of thofe they call d CUNNING-MEN,
or at leaft he endeavoured to pafs for fuch a one?
but twas all a Cheat.
Befides, what had the Demi to do to deteel:
Thieves, and reflore ftollen Goods? Thieving and
Robbing, Trick and Cheat, are part of the Craft
of his Agency, and of the Employments which it
ie hi$ Buiinefs to encourage; they greatly miftake
him, who think he will arlift
any Body in fup-
preffing and detecting iiich laudable Arts and fuch
diligent Servants.
I won t
fay, but the Devi!, to draw thefe Peo*
pie we call Cunning-Men, into a Snare, and to
pufh on his farther Defigns, may encourage them
privately, and in a manner that they themfclves
know nothing of, to make ufe of his Name, and
abufe the World about him, till at laft they may
really believe they do deal with the Devil, when
indeed tis
only he deals with them, and they know-
nothing of the Matter.
In other Cafes he may encourage them in thefe
little Frauds and Cheats, and give them leave,,
as above, to make ufe of his Name to bring
them afterwards, and by Degrees to have a real
Acquaintance with him ; fo bringing the Jeft of
their Trade into Earnefr,, till at length prompt
ing them to commit fome great Villany, he fe-
B b 5 cures
374 The Modern HISTORY
cures them to be his own, by their very Fear of
his leaving them to be expofed to the World j
thus he puts a Jonathan Wild upon them, and
makes them be the very Wretches they only pre
tended to be before : So old Parfons of Clithroe,
as Fame tells, was twenty five Years a Cunning-man^
and twenty two Years a Witch &amp;gt;
that is to lay, for
five and twenty Years, he was only pretending to
deal with the Devil^ when Satan and he had no
manner of Acquaintance^ and he only put his
Legcr-de-wain upon the People in the Devil s
Name, without his leave j but at length the
Devil s Patience being tir d quite out, he told
the old Counterfeit, that in fhort, he had been
his ilalking Horfe long enough, and that now, if
he thought fit to enter himfelf, and take a Com-
mifHon, well and good 3 and he mould have a
Leafe to carry on his Trade for fo many Years
more, to his Heart s content 5 but if not, he
would expofe his
Knavery to the World, for that
he mould take away his Peoples Trade no lon
ger ^ but that he (Satan) would fet up another in
his Room, that mould make a meer Fool of him,
and carry away all his Cuftomers.
Upon this, the old Man confider d of it, took
the Devil s
Counfel, and lifted in his Pay -,
fo
he, that had plaid his Pranks twenty five Years
as a
Conjurer, when he was no Conjurer, was
then forc d really to deal with the DEVIL, for
fear the People mould know he did not : Till now
he had ambo dexter^ cheated the Devil on one
Hand, and the People on the other 5 but the De
vil gain d his Point at lafl, and fo he was a real
Wizard ever after.
But this is not the only way the Devil is in-
jur d neither, for we have often found People
pretend upon him in other Cafes, and of nearer
.
Concern to him a great deal, and in Articles more
z Wcightyj
of the DEVIL;
Weighty, as in particular, in the great Bufinefs
of PofTeilion 5 it is true this Point is not thoro ly
underflood among Men, neither has the Devil
thought fit to give us thofc Illuminations about
it, as I believe he might do&amp;gt;
particularly that
feat
and important Article, is
not, for ought
can fee, rightly explained, namely j whether
there arc not two feveral Kinds of PoflefTion,
(viz.) fome wherein the Devil poflefTes us, and
fome in which we really poflefs the Devil 5 the
Nicety of which I doubt this Age, with all its
Penetration, is not qualified to explain, and a Dif-
fertation upon it
being too long for this Work,
efpecially fo near its Conclufion, I am obHg^i to
omit, as I am alfo all the practical Difcourfes up
on the Ufefulnefs and Advantages of real Poflef-
fion, whether confider d one Way or other to
Mankind, all which I muft leave to hereafter.
But to come back to the Point in Hand, and
to confider the Injuftice done to the Devil, in
the various Turns and Tricks which Men put up
on him very often in this one Article (viz.) pretend
ing to Pofleflion, and to have the Devil in them,
when really it is not fo$ certainly the Devil mufl
take it
very ill, to have all their demented, luna-
tick Tricks charg d upon him 5 fome of which,
nay, moft of which are fo grofs, fo fimple, fo
empty, and fo little to thePurpofe, that the Devil
muft be aiham d to fee fuch Things pafs in his
Name, or that the World Ihould think he was
concern d in them.
It is true, that Pofleffion being one of the
principal Pieces of the Devil s Artifice in his
managing Mankind, and in which, with the moflr
exquifite
skill he plays the Devil among us, he
has the more Reafon to be affronted when he
finds himfelf invaded in this Part, and angry that
any Body fhould pretend to poflefs, or be poflefs
d
B b 4 without
57&amp;lt;5
The Modern H 1 S T Q R Y
without his leave ,
and this may be the Reafon
for ought we know, why fo
many Blunders have
been made, when People have pretended to it
without him, and he lias thought fit not to
own them in it 3 of which we have many Ex
amples in Hiftory, as in Simon Magus^ the Devil
of London, the fair Maid of Kent, and feyeral
others, whofe Hiftory it is not worth while to
enlarge upon.
In ihort, Pofieffions, as I have faid, are nice
Things, as it is not fo eafy to mimick the Devil
in that Part, as it
may be in fome other &amp;gt;
defign-
ing Men have attempted it
often, but their man
ner has been cafily diiiinguifh d, even without the
Devil s Afliftance.
Thus the People of Salem in New-England
pretended to be bewitch d, and that a black Man
tormented them by the Inftigation of fuch and
fuch, whom they refoly d to bring to the Gal
lows : This black Man they would have be the
Devil) employed by the Perfon who they acciis d
for a Witch : Thus making the Devil a Page or
a Footman to the Wizard, to go and torment
whoever the faid Wizard commanded, till the
Devil himfclf was fo weary of the foolifh Part,
that he left them to go on their own Way, and
at laft they over-acted the
murthering Part fo far,
that when they con fefs d themfelves to be Witches^
and poflefs d, and that they had Correfpondence
with the Devil, Satan not appearing to vouch
for them, no Jury would condemn them upon
their own Evidence, arid they could not get
themfelves ha-ng d, whatever Pains they took to
bring it to pafs.
^Thus you fee the Devil may be wrong d, and
falfely accus d in many Particulars, and often
has been fo ; there are likewife fome other forts
of counterfeit Devils in the World, fuch as Gyp-
DEVIL; 377
Jf.es9 Fortune-Tellers^ Foretellers of good and bad
Luck, Sellers of Winds, Raifers of Storms, and
many more, fome pra&is d among us, fome in
foreign Parts, too many almoft to reckon up ;
nay I almofl doubt whether the Devil himielf
knows all the Sorts of them 5 for tis evident he
has little or nothing to do with them, I mean
not in the Way of their Craft.
Thefe I take to be Interlopers, or with the
Guinea Merchants leave, feparate Traders, and
who act under the Skreen and Protection of Sa
tan s Power, but without his Licenfe or Autho
rity 5 no doubt thefe carry away a great deal of
his Trade, that is to fay, the Trade which other-
wife trie Devil might have carried on by Agents
of his own&amp;gt; I cannot but fay, that while thefe
People would fain be thought Devils, tho they
really are not, it is but juft they ihould be real
ly made as much Devils as they pretended to be,
or that Satan fhould do hitnfelf Juftice upon
them, as he threaten d to do upon old Parfons of
Clithroe abovemention d, and let the World know
them.

THO
I am writing the Hiftory of the De
vil,. I have not undertaken to do the like of
all the Kinds of People, Male or Female, who
fet up for Devils in the World : This would be
a Task for the Devil indeed, and fit
only for him
to
378 The Modern HISTORY
to undertake, for their Number is and has been
prodigious great, and may, with his other Legi
ons be rank d among the Innumerable.
What a World do we inhabit ! where there is
not only with us a great Roaring-Lyon-Devil
daily feeking whom of us he may devour, and in
numerable Millions of letter Devils hovering in
the whole Atmofphere over us, nay, and for ought
we know, other Millions always invifibly moving
about us, and perhaps in us, or atleaftin many of
us&amp;gt;
but that have, befides all
thefe, a vaft
many
counterfeit Hocus Poms Devils; human Devils, who
are vifible among us, of our own Species and Fra-
ternity,converiing with us upon all Occafions 5 who
like Mountebanks fet up their Stages in every
Town, chat with us at every Tea-Table, converfe
with us in every Coffee- Houfe, and impudently
tell us to our Faces that they are Devils, boaftof it,
and ufe a thoufand Tricks and Arts to make us
believe it too, and that too often with Succefs.
It muffc be confefs d there is a ftrong Propen-
fity in Man s Nature, efpecially the more igno
rant part of Mankind, to refolve every ftrange
Thing, or whether really flrange or no, if it be
but ftrange to us, into Devilifm, and to fay every
Thing is the Devil, that they can give no Ac
count of.
Thus the famous Doftors of the Faculty at
Pari^ when John Fauftus brought the firft
print
ed Books that had then been fcen in the World, or
at leaft feen there, into the City, and fold them for
Manufcripts :
They were furpriz d at the Perform
ance, and queftion d Fauftus about it ; but he af
firming they were Manufcripts, and that he kept
a great many Clarks employed to write them, they
were fatisfied for a while.
But looking farther into the Work, they ob-
ferv d the exacb Agreement of every Book, one
with
of the DEVIL. 379
with another, that every Line flood in the fame
Place, every Page a like Number of Lines, every
Line a like Number of Words $ if a Word was
mif-fpelt in one, it was mif-fpek alfo in all, nay,
that if there was a Blot in one, it was alike in
allj they began again to mufe, how this fhould
be ? in a Word, the learned Divines not being able
to comprehend the Thing (af^d that was always
fufficient) concluded it muft be the Devil, that
it was done by Magick and Witchcraft, and that
in fhort, poor Fauftus (who was indeed nothing
but a meer Printer) dealt with the Devil.
N. B. John Fauftus was Servant, or Journey
man, or Compofitor, or what you pleafe to
call it, to Kofter of Harlem, the firlt inven
tor of Printing $ and having printed the
Pfalter, fold them at Paris as Manufcriptsj
becaufe as fuch they yielded a better Price.
But the learned Dofbors not being able to un-
derfland how the Work was perform d, concluded
as above, it was all the Devil, and that the Man
was a Witch $ accordingly they took him up for a
Magician and a Conjurer, and one that work d by
the Black Art, that is to fay, by the help of the

at laft he was oblig d, for fear of the Gallows, to

the furpraing Accounts which the People gave
of their wonderful

and if
they had

Ei: 381
The Scripture fpeaks of a Spirit of Dtoination,
xvi. 16. and a Wench that was pofTefs d by
this Spirit Brought her Mafter much Gain by South-
faying^ that is to fay, according to the Learned,
by Oracling or anfwering Queftions &amp;gt;
whence
you will fee in the Margin, that this
fouthfaying
Devil is there call d Python, that is, Apollo, who is
often calPd Python, and who at the Oracle of Del-
$hos gave out fuch Anfwers and double Entendres,
as this Wench poffibly did 5 and hence all thofe
Spirits which were call d Spirits of Divination,
tvere in another Senfe call d Pythons.
Now when the Apoflle St. Paul came to fee
this Creature, this Spirit takes upon it to declare
that thofe Men, meaning St. Paul and Timo-
theus, were the Servants of the moft high God,
which Jhewd unto them the Way of Salvation-, this
Was a good turn of the Devil, to preferve his
Authority in the poflefs d Girl j fhe brought them
Gain by Southfaying, that is to fay, relblving dif
ficult Queftions, anfwering Doubts, interpreting
Dreams, &c. Among thefe Doubts, he makes
her give Teftimony to Paul and Timotheus, to
\vheedle in with the new Chriflians, and perhaps
(tho very ignorantly) even with Paul and Tirno-
theus thernfelves, fo to give a Kind of Credit and
Rcfpecl: to her for fpeaking.
But the Devil, who never fpeaks Truth, but
with fome finifler End, was difcover d here and de-
te&ed -
y his flattering Recognition not accepted, and
he himfelf unkenneled as he deferv d &amp;gt;
there the De-
vil was over-fhot in his own Bow again.
Here now was a real Pofleflion, and the evil
Spirits who pofiefs d her, did ftoop to fimdry lit
tle Acts of Servitude, that we could give little
or no Reafon for, only that the Girl s Mafter might
get Money by herj but perhaps this was a par
ticular Cafe, and, prepar d to honour the Au-
l thority
3*2, The Modern HISTORY
thority and Power the Apoftles hud over evil Spirits-
But we find thefe Things carried a great Way
farther in many Cafes, that is to fay, wfcere the
Parties are thus really poffefs d &amp;gt;
namely, the De
vil makes Agents of the poffefs d Parties to do
many Things for the propagating his Intereft
and Kingdom, and particularly for the carrying
on his Dominion in the World : But I am for
the prefent not fo much upon the real Poffeffion
as the pretended, and particularly we have had
many that have believed themfelves poffefs d, when
the Devil never believed it of them, and perhaps
knew them better j fome of thefe are really poor
Devils to be pitied, and are what I call Diabks
Imaginaire 5 thefe have notwith {landing done the
Devil good Service, and brought their Mailers
good Gain by Southfaying.
We find Pofleflions acknowledged in
Scripture
to be really and perfonally the Devil^ or accord
ing to the Text, Legions of Devils in the Plu
ral. The Devil or Devils rather, which poflef-
fed the Man among the Tombs, is
pofitively af-
firm d to be the Devil in the Scripture &amp;gt;
all the
Evangclifts agree in calling him fo, and his very
Works fliew it 5 namely, the Mifchief he did,
as well to the poor Creature among the Tombs,
\vho was made fa fierce, that he was the Terror
of all the Country, as to the Herd of Swine and
to the Country in the Lofs of them.
I might preach you a I^e&ure here of the
Devil s Terror upon the Approach of our Saviour,
the Dread of his Government, and how he ac-
knowledg d that there was a Time for his Tor
ment, which was not yet come : drt thou came to
torment us before our Utme? It is evident the De
vil
apprehended that Chrift would chain them
up before the Day of Judgment $ and therefore
fome think the Devil here, being, as it were,
caught
385
caught out of his due Bounds, poflefling the poor
Man in fuch a furious manner, was afraid, and
petition d Chrift not to chain him up for it, and
as the Text fays, They befought him to
fuffer them
to go away, &c. that is to fay, when they fay,
art thou come to torment us before the Time?
the Meaning is, they begg d he would not caft
them into Torment before the Time, which was
already fix d 5 but that if he would caft them out
of the Man, he would let them go away, &c.
The Evangelift St. Luke fays, the Devil be-
fought him that he would not command them to go
out into the Deep : Our learned Annotators think
that part is not rightly rendered j adding, tshat they
do not believe the Devil fears
drowning j but with
Submiffion, I believe the meaning is, that they
would not be confin d to the vaft Ocean, where
no Inhabitants being to be feen, they would be ef
fectually imprifon d and tied down from doing MiP
chief, which would be a Hell to them , as to their
going into the Swine, that might afford us fome
Allegory j but I am not difpofed to jefl with the
Scripture, no nor with the Devil neither, farther
than needs muft.
It is evident the Devil makes Ufe of very mean
Inftruments fometimes, fuch as the Damfel pofTefs d
with a Spirit of Divination, and feveral others.
I remember a Story, how true I know not, of
a weak Creature next Door to an Ideot, who
was eftablilli d in the Country for an Oracle, and
would tell
People ftrange Things that fhould be,
long before they came to pafs ; when People were
lick, would tell them whether they fhould live
or die $ if People were married, tell how many
Children they fhould have 5 and a hundred fuch
Things as fill d the People with Admiration, and
they were the eafier brought to believe that the Girl
was poflefs dj but then they were divided about
her
The
her too, and that was the fineft
fpun Thread thfi
Devil could work, for he carried a great Point in
it 5 fome faid fhe had a good Spirit, and fome a
bad, fome faid fhe was a Prophetefs, and fome
that fhe was the Devil.
Now had I been there to decide the QuefKon,
I fhould certainly have given it for the latter 5 if
it were only upon this Account, namely, that
the Devil has often found Fools very neceflary
Agents for the propagating his Intereft and King
dom, but we never knew the good Spirits do fo &amp;gt;
on the other Hand, it does not feem likely that
Heaven fhould deprive a poor Creature of its
Senfes, and as it were take her Soul from her,
and then make her an Inftrument of Initru&ion
to others, and an Oracle to declare his Decrees
by 5 this does not feem to be rational.
But as tar as this kind of Divination is in Uie
in our Days, yet I do not find room to charge
the DevilVith making any great Ufe of Fools,
unlefs it be fuch as he has particularly qualified
for his Work, for as to Ideots and Naturals^ they
are perfectly ufelefs to him &amp;gt;
but a fort of Fools
call d the Magi, indeed, we have fome Reafon to
think he often works with.
We are not arrived to a certainty yet, in the fet
tling this great Point, namely, what Magick is ?
whether a diabolical Art or a Branch of the Ma-
thcrnaticks? Our moft learned Lexicon Technicum
is of the latter Opinion, and gives the Magic Square
and the Magic Lantern^ two Terms of Art.
The Magic Square is when Numbers in Arith
metical Proportion are difpos d into fuch Parallels
or equal Ranks, as that the Sums of each Row
as well Diagonally as Laterally ihall be all equal j
for Example, 2, 3, 4, f, &amp;lt;5, 7, 8, p, 10. Place
thefe Nine in a Square of three, they will direft-
ly and diagonally make 1 8. Thus^
This
r 1
jPLjJ_
of the DEVIL; 335
/
This he calls the Magic Square,
but gives no Reafon for the Term,
nor any Account of what infernal
Operations are
wrought by this Con
currence of the Numbers &amp;gt;
neither
do I fee that there can be any fuch
Ufe made of it.
The Magic Lantern is an optic Machine, by the
Means of which are reprefented, on a Wall in
the Dark, many Phantafms and terrible Appear
ances, but no Devil in all this, only that they are
taken for the Effects of Magic, by thofe that are
not acquainted with the Secret.
All this is done by the help of feveral little
painted Pieces of Glafs, only ib and fo fituated,
plac d in certain Oppositions to one another, and
painted with different Figures, the moil formida
ble being plac d foremoft, and fuch as are moil
capable of terrifying the Spectators
-
y and by this
all the Figures may be reprefented upon the op-
poilte Wall, in the Inrgeit Size.
I cannot but take Notice, that this very Piece
of optic Delufion feems too much akin to the
mock PofTeffions and infernal Accomplishments,
which mod: ofthe PofTeflionifts of this Age pretend
to, fo that they are mod of them meer Phantafms
and Appearances, and no more 5 Nor is the Spirit of
Divination, the Magic, the Necromancing, ard
other Arts which were call d Diabolical, found
to be of any Ufe in modern Practice, at lead, in
thefe Parts of the World 5 but the Devil feems to
do moft of his Work himfelf, and by fliorter Me
thods 5 for he has fo compleat an Influence among
thofe that he now Lifts in his Service, that he
brings all the common Affairs of Mankind into a
narrower Compafs in his Management, with a
C c Dexte-
3*6 The Modern HISTORY
Dexterity particular to himfelf, and by which he
carries on his Interefl filently and furely, much
more to the Detriment of Virtue and good Go
vernment, and confequently much more to his
Satisfaction, than ever he did before.
There is a Kind of Magic or Sorcery^ or what
elfe you may pleafe to call it, which, tho un
known to us, is yet, it feems, flill
very much en-
courag d by the Devil} but this is a great Way off,
and in Countries where the politer Inftruments,
which he finds here, are not to be had j namely, a-
mong the Indians of North-America j This is call d
Pawawing} and they have their Divines, which
they call Pawaws or Witches, who ufe ftrange
Gefhires, Diflortions, horrid Smokes, Burnings,
and Scents, and feveral fuch Things which the
Sorcerers and Witches in antient Times are faid
to ufc in cafting Nativities, in Philtres, and in
determining, or as
they pretended, directing the
Fate of Perfons ; by burning fuch and fuch Herbs
and Roots, fuch as Hele&ore9 Wormwood, Storax,
JDevilworty Mandrake^ Nightjhade, and Abundance
more fuch, which are call d noxious Plants, or the
Product of noxious Plants -
y alfo
melting fuch and
fuch Minerals, Gums, and poifonous Things,
and by feveral hellifh
Mutterings and Markings
over them, the like do thefe Pawaws-y and the
Devil is
pleafcd, it feems, (or is
permitted) to fall
in with thefe Things, and as fome People think,
appears often to them for their Affiflance upon
thofe Occaiions.
But be thai as it will, he is eas d of all that
Trouble here &amp;gt;
he can Patvaw here himfelf, with
out their aid, and having laid them all afide, he
negotiates much of his Bufinefs without Ambaf-
fadors j he is his own Plenipotentiary, for he finds
Man fo
eafy to come at, and fo eafy when he is come
at, that he flands in no need of fecret Emiflaries,
or at Icail not fo much as he ufed to do. Upon

^ Upon the whole, as the World, within the
Compafs of a few pafs d Years is advanced in all
Kinds of Knowledge and Arts, and every ufeful
Branch of what they knew before improv d, and
innumerable ufeful Parts of Knowledge, which
were coriceal d before are difcover d j why fhould
we think the Devil alone fhould fhnd at a flay,
has taken no Steps to his farther Accomplifh-
ment, and made no ufeful Difcoveries in his Way?
That he alone fhould ihnd at a Stay, and be juft
the fame unimprov d Devil that he was before ?
No, no, as the World is
improv d every Day, and
every Age is
grown wifer and wiferthan their Fa
thers &amp;gt;
fo, no doubt, he has beftirr d fiimfelf too,
in order to an encreafe of Knowledge and Difco-
very, and that he finds every Day a nearer Way
to go to work wirh Mankind than he had before.
Befides, as Men in general feem to have aher d
their manner, and that they move in a higher
and more exalted Sphere, efpecially as to Vice
and Virtue 5 fo the Devil may have been oblig
ed to change his Meafures, and alter his Way
of working j particularly, thofe Things which
would take in former Times, and which a ftupid
Age would come eafily into^ won t
go down
with us now : As the tafte of Vice and Virtue alters,
the Devil is forc d to bait his Hook with new
Competitions ; the very Thing calPd Temptation
is alter d in its
Nature, and that which ferv d
to delude our Anceftors, whofe grofs Concep
tions of Things caufed them to be manageable
with lefs Art, will not do now 5 the Cafe is
quite
alter d j in fome Things, perhaps, as I hinted above,
we come into Crime with eafe, and may be led
by a Finger &amp;gt;
but when we come to a more
refin d Way of finning, which our Anceftors ne
ver underftood, other and more refin d Politics
xnufi be made Ufe of, and the Devil rws been put
C c z upon
3SS The Modern HI STORY
upon many ufeful Projects and Inventions, to
make many new Difcoveries and Experiments
to carry on his Affairs $ and to (peak impartially,
he is
ftrangely improved either in Knowledge
or Experiment, within thefe few Years j he has
found out a great many new Inventions to
fhorten his own Labour, and carry on hisBuiinefs
in the World currently, which he never was
matter of before, or at lead we never knew he
was.
No wonder then that he has chang d Hands
too, and that he has left of pawawing in thefe
Parts of the World $ that we don t find our
Houfes difturb d as they tifed to be, and the Stools
and Chairs walking about out of one Room into
another, as
formerly -,
that Children don t vomit
crooked Pins and nifty flub Nails, as of old,
the Air is not full of Noifes, nor the Church-
Yard full of Hobgoblins &amp;gt;
Ghofls don t walk
about in Winding-Sheets, and the good old
fcolding Wives vifit and plague their Husbands
after they are dead, as
they did when they were
alive.
The Age is
grown too wife to be agitated by
thefe dull fcare-crow Things which their Fore-
Fathers were tickled with &amp;gt;
Satan has been oblig
ed to lay by his Puppet-fhews and his Tum
blers, thofe things are grown dale 5 his morrice-
dancing Devils, his mountebanking and quacking
won t do now$ thofe Things, as they may be fup-
pofed to be very troublefome to him, (and but
that he has Servants enough would be chargeable
too) are now of no great Ufe in the new Ma
nagement of his Affairs.
In a Word, Men are too much Devils them-
felves, in the Senfe that I have calPd them fo?
to be frighted with fuch little low priz d Ap
pearances as thefe 5 they are better acquainted with

the old Arch-Angel than fo, and they Teem to
tell him they muit be treated after another man
ner, and that then, as they are good-natur d and
traceable, he may deal with them upon better
Terms.
Hence the Devil goes to work with Mankind
a much ihorter Way ; for inftead of the Art of
Wheedling and Whining, together with the la
borious Part of Tricking and Sharping, Hurry
ing and Driving, Frighting and Terrifying, all
which the Devil was put to the Trouble of be-
fore; in fhort, he acts the GRAND MANNER as
the Architects call it (I don t know whether our
Free-Mafons mayunderfcand the Word) and there
fore I
may hereafter explain it, as it is to be Diabo
lically as well as
mathematically underftood.
At prefent my meaning is, he a&amp;lt;5ts with them
immediately and perfonally by a magnificent Tranf-
formation, making them meer Devils to them-
felves, upon all needful Occafions, and Devils to
one another too, whenever he (Satan, has Need of
their Service.
This Way of embarking Mankind in the De-
viTs particular Engagement, is
really very mo
dern} and tho the Devil himfelf may have been
long acquainted with the Method, and as I have
heard, began to practife it towards the Clofe of
the Roman Empire, when Men began to act up
on very polite Principles, and were capable of
the moft refin d Wickednefs, and afterwards with
ibme Popes, who likewife were a kind of Church
Devils, iuch as Satan himfelf could hardly expect
to find in the World; yet I do not find that he
was ever able to bring it into Praftice, at leaft, not
fo univerfally as he does now : But now the Cafe
is altered, and Men being generally more expert
in Wickednefs than they were formerly ; they

This Particular would want much the left Ex

Impeachment of their Characters, as wife Men,
and without any Diminution of that Part of their
Denomination which eftablifh d them for Fools.
How many mad Fellows appear among us every
Day in the critical Juncture of their Tranfmi-
gration, juft when they have fo much of the
Man left as to be known by their Names, and
enough of the Devil taken up to fettle their Cha
racters ? This Eaiinefs of the Devil s accefs to
thefe People, and the great Convenience it is to
him in his general Buiinefs, is a Proof to me
that he has no more Occafion of Diviners, Magi
cians, Sorcerers, and whatever elfe we pleafc to
call thofe People who were formerly fo great with
him ; for what Occafion has he to employ Devils
and Wizards to confound Mankind, when be is
arriv d to fuch a Perfection of Art as to bring
Men, at leaft in thefe Parts of the World, to do it
all themfelvcs j upon this Account we do not find
any of the old Sorcerers and Diviners, Magici
ans or Witches appear among us $ not that the
Devil might not be as well able to employ fuch
People as
formerly, and qualify them for the Em
ployment too, but that really there is no need of
them hereabout, the Devil having a fhorter Way,
and Mankind being much more eafily poflefs dj
not the old Herd of Swine were fooner agitated,
tho there was full 2000 of them together &amp;gt;
Na

ners are quite out of the Queftion.
Nor let
any Man be alarm d at this Alteration,
in the Cafe as it ftands between Mankind and the
Devil, and think the Devil having gain d fo
much Ground, may in time, by Encroachment,
come to a general PofTeffion of the whole Race,
and fo we fhould all come to be Devils incarnate j
I
fay, let us not be alarm d, for Satan does not
Set
thefe Advantages by Encroachment, and by
is infernal Power or Art, no not at all 5 but tis
the Man himfelfdoes it
by his Indolence and Neg
ligence on one Hand, and his Complaifance to
the Devil on the other 5 and both Ways he, as it
were, opens the Door to him, beckons him with
his
very Hand to come in, and the Devil has no
thing to do but enter and take PofTeflion : Now
if it be fo,and Man isfo frank to him 3 you know
the Devil is no Fool not to take the Advantage
when tis offer d him, and therefore tis no won
der if the Confequences which I have been juft

But let no Man be difcourag d by this, from
reafluming his natural and religious Powers, and
venturing to fruit the Devil out 5 for the Cafe is
plain he may be fhut out 5 the Soul is a ftrong Caf-

their Duty, it is

he be laid by the Heels, that is, left his Weak-
nefs be expofed, and all his Lurking, lying in

great Enlargement, but I have not room to be
witty upon him, fo you muft take it in the

with feveral Things befides Holy Water , but tis
too ferious for you, and you ll tell me I am a
preaching and a canting, and the like ; fo I muft
let the Devil manage you rather than difpleafe
you with talking Scripture and Religion.
Well, but may not the Devil be fought with*
fome of his own Weapons ? Is there no dealing
&amp;lt;
with him in a Way of human Nature ? This?
would require a long anfwer, and fome Philofo-;
phy might be aclcd ?

to draw away even the Devil himfelfj as in fome
Places they nail Horfe-Shoes upon the Threfhold

But to go on with my Work, the Devil, I
fay,
is not to be fcar d with Maukins, nor docs he
employ his old Inflruments, but does much of his
Work himfelf without Internments.
And yet I muft enter a Caveat here too, againft
being mifunderftood in my faying the Devil itands
in no need of Agents ; for when I fpeak fo, I
am to be taken in a limited Senfe -
y I don t
fay
he needs them no where, but only that he does
not need them in thofe polite Parts of the World
which I have been fpeaking of, and perhaps not
much here 5 but in many remote Countries tis
otherwife ftillj the Indians of America are par
ticularly (aid to have Witches among them, as
well in thofe Countries where the Spaniards and
the Engtiflj) and other Nations have planted them-
felves, as among-fl thofe where the European Nati
ons feldom come :
for Example^ the People of Ca
nada, that is, of the Countries under the French
Government of Qjiebeck, the Equimeaux, and
other Northern Climates, have Magicians, Wizards
and Witches, who they call Pilioatas or Pillo-
toasy thefe pretend they fpeak intimately and fa
miliarly with the Devil, and receive from him
the Knowledge of Things to comej all
which,
by the Way, I take to be little more than this &amp;gt;
that thefe Fellows being a little more cunning
than the reft, think, that by pretending to fome-
thing more than human, they fhall make the
ilronger Impreffions on the ignorant People ; as
Mahomet amus d the World with his Pigeon, uf-
ing it to pick Peas out of his Ear, and perfuaded
the People it
brought him fuperior Revelations
and Infpirations from Paradife.
Thus thefe Pillotoas gaining an Opinion among
the People, behave like fo many Mountebanks
of Hell, pretending to underftand dark Things,
cure Difeafes, praclife Surgery, Phyfick and
Nccro.
394 The Modern HISTORY
Necromancy altogether; I will not fay,
but Sa
tan may pick out fuch Tools to work with, and
I believe does in thole Parts, but I think he has
found a nearer Way to the Wood with us, and
that is fufficient to my prefent Purpofe.
Some would perfuadc me the Devil had a great
Hand in the late
religious Breaches in France,
among the Clergy, (viz.) about the Pope s Confli-
tution UnigenituS) and that he made a fair
Attempt
to fet the Pope and the Galilean Church together
by the Ears, for they were all
juffc upon the Point
ofbreaking out into a Church War, that for ought
we knew might have gone farther than the Devil
himfelf car d it fhould ; now I am of the quite
contrary Opinion, I believe the Devil really did not
make the Breach, but rather heal d ir, for fear it
fhould have gone fo far among them as to have
fet them all in a Flame, and have open d the Door
to the Return of the Hugonots again, which it was
in a fair Way to have done.
But be it one Way or t other, the hiftorical
Part feems to be a little
again!! me; for tis cer
tain, the Devil both wanted and made Ufe of Le-
fions
of Agents, as well human as infernal, vifi-
le and inviiible in that great and important Af
fair, and we cannot doubt but he has innumera
ble Inftrurnents ftill at work about it.
Like as in Poland^ J make no Queflion but the
Devil has thouiands of his Banditti at work at
this Time, and in another Country not far from
ir, perhaps, preparing Matters for the next Gene
ral Diet, taking care to prevent giving any Re
laxation to the Proreftants, and to juflity the mo
derate Executions at ^born, to excite a Nation
to quarrel with every Body who are able to fight
with no body ; to erect the Apoftate Race of
S- y upon a Throne which they have no Title
to, and turn an eleftivc Throne into an heredita
ry, in favour of Popery. I might
of the DEVIL. 395
I might anticipate all your Obje&amp;lt;5Hons, by
granting the bufy Devil at this Time employing
all his Agents and Inftruments (for I never told
you they were idle and ufelefs) in (hiving to en-
flame the Chriftian World, and bring a new War
to cverfpread Europe \ I might, perhaps, point
out to you fome of the Meafures he takes, the
Provocatives which his State Phyficians admini-
fter to the Courts and Counfellors of Princes, to
foment and ferment the Spirits,
and Members of
Nations, Kingdoms, Empires and States in the
World, in order to bring thefe glorious Ends of
Blood and War to pafs j for you cannot think
but he that knows fo much of the Devil s Af
fairs, as to write his Hiilory, muft know fome-
thing of all thefe Matters more than thofe that
do not know fo much as he.
But all this is remote to the prefent Cafe, for
this is no Impeachment of Satan s new Methods
with Mankind, in this Part of the World, and
in his private and feparate Capacity j all this only
fignifies that in his more general and national Af
fairs, the Devil acts ftill by his old Methods 3 and
when he is to feduce or embroil Nations, he, like
other Conquerors, fubdues them by Armies, em
ploys mighty Squadrons of Devils, and fends out
flrong Detachments, with Generals and Genera-
liflimos to lead them, fome to one Part of the
World, fome to another 3 fome to influence one
Nation, fome to manage and direft another, ac
cording as Bufinefs prefents,
and his Occaflons
require,
that his Affairs may be carried on cur
rently, and to his Satisfaction.
If it were not thus, but that the Devil by his
new and exquifite Management, of which I have
faid fo much, had brought Mankind in general
to be the Agents of their own Mifchiefs, and
that the World were fo at his Beck, that he
need
596 The Modern HISTORY
need but command them to go and fight, declare
War, raiie Armies, deftroy Cities, Kingdoms,
Countries and People 5 the World would be a
Field or&quot; Blood indeed, and all
Things would run
into Confufion prefcntly.
But this is not the Cafe at all. Heaven has not
let go the Government of the Creation to his
fubdu d Enemy, the Devil &amp;gt;
that would overturn
the whole Syitem of God, and give Satan more
Power, than ever he was or will be vefted with &amp;gt;
when, therefore, I
fpeak of a few forward Wretches
in our Day, who are fo warm in their Wicked-
nefs, that they anticipate the Devil, lave him the
Trouble to tempt, turn Devils to themfelves, and
gallop Hellward fafter than he drives 3 I
fpeak of
them as iingle Perfons, and a&ing in their own
perfonal and private Capacity, but when I fpeak
of Nations and Kingdoms, there the Devil is
oblig d to go on in the old Road, and ac~b
by Stra
tagem, by his proper Machinery, and to make
tile of all his Arts, and all his Agents, juft as he
has done in all
Ages, from the beginning of his
politic
Government to this Day.
And if it was not thus too, what would become
of all his nurabcrlefs Legions, of which all
Ages
have heard fo much, and all Parts of the World
have had fo much fatal Experience? They would
feem to be quite out of Employment, and be
rendered ufelefs in the World of Spirits, where
it is to be fuppofed they refide; not the Devil him-
felf could find any Bufinefs for them, which by the
Way, to bufy and mifchievous Spirits, as they
are, would be a Hell to them, even before their
Timej they would be, as it were, doom d to a
State of Inactivity, which we may fuppofe was
one Part of their Expullion from Bleflednefs and
the Creation of Man j or as
they were for the
iurprifing Interval between the Deftruction of
Mankind
.
397
Mankind by the Deluge and Noah s
coming out
of the Ark, when indeed they might be laid to
have nothing at all to do.
But this is not Satan s Cafe, and therefore let
me tell
you too, that you may not think I treat
the Cafe with more Levity than I really do, and
than I am fure I intend to do -
y tho it is too true
that our modern and modiih Sinners have arriv
ed to more exquifite Ways of being wicked,
than their Fathers, and really feem, as I have
laid, to need no Devil to tempt them &amp;gt;
nay, that
they do Satan s Work for him as to others alfo,
and make themfelves Devils to their Neighbours,
tempting others to crime even falter than the
Devil defires them, running before they are fenr,
and going of the Devil s Emndsgratis 5 by which
Means Satan s Work is, as to them, done to his
Hand, and they may be faid to fave him a great
deal of Trouble , yet after all, the Devil has
{till a great deal of Bufinefs upon his Hands,
and as well himfelf as all his Legions,
find them
felves a full Employment in dilturbing the World,
and oppofmg the Glory and Kingdom of their
great Superior, whofe Kingdom it is their whole
Bufinefs, however vain in its End, to overthrow
and deftroy, if they were able, or at leaft to en
deavour it.
This being the Cafe, it follows of courfe that
the general
Mifchiefs of Mankind, as well national
and public, as family Mifchiefs, and even perfonal,
(except as before excepted) lie all (till at the Dmfs
Door, as much as ever, let his Advocates bring him
off of it if they can ,
and this brings us back again
to the manner of the Devil s Management, and
the Way of his working by human Agents, or
if you will, the Way of human Devils, working
in Affairs of low Life, fuch as we call Vi~
tion, Sorcery, Black- Art, Necromancy, and th
luce
3ps The Modern HISTORY
like&amp;gt;
all which I take to confifl of two material
Parts, and both very neceflary for us to be right*
ly inform d of.
I . The Part which Satan by himfelf or his infe
rior Devils empowers fuch People to do, as
he is in Confederacy with here on Earth $ to
whom he may be laid, like the Mailer of an
Opera or Comedy, to give their Parts to
act, and to qualify them, to ac~b it &amp;gt;
whether
he obliges them toaRehearfal in his Prefence,
to try their Talents, and fee that they are ca
pable of performing, that indeed I have not
enquired into.
i. That Part which thefe empowered People do
voluntier or beyond their Commiffion,to ihew
their Diligence in the Service of their new
Mailer, and either (i.) to bring Grifl to their
own Mill, and make their Market of their
Employment in the beil manner they can $ or
(z.) to gain Applaufe, be admir d, wonder d
at, and applauded, as if they were ten Times
more Devils than really they are.
In a Word, the Matter confifts of what the
Devil does by the Help of thefe People, and what
they do in his Name without him j the Devil is
fometimes cheated in his own Bufinefs j there are
Pretenders to Witchcraft and Black-Art, who
Satan never made any Bargain with, but who he
connives at, becaule at leall they do his Caufe no
harm, tho their Bufinefs is rather to get Money,
than to render him any Service, of which I gave
you a remarkable Inftance before.
But to go back to his real Agents, of which
I reckon two.
i.Thofe
of the DEVIL. 399
I . Thofe who aft by Dire&ion and Confede
racy, as I have faid already many do.
z. Thofe whom he acts in and by, and they (per
haps) know it not, of which Sort Hiftory
gives us plenty of Examples, from Machia-
vers firft
Difciplc to the famous Car
dinal Alberoni, and even to fome more mo
dern than his Eminence, of whom I can
fay no more till farther Occafion offers.
I. Thofe who a&amp;lt;5t
by immediate Direction of
the Devil, and in Confederacy with him) thefeare
fuch as I mention d in the beginning of this Chap
ter, whole Arts are truly black, becaufe really
infernal ) it will be very hard to decide the Dii-
pute between thofe who really a6b thus in Con
federacy with the Devi^ and thofe who only
pretend to it) fo I fhall leave that Difpute where
I find it&amp;gt;
but that there are, or at leaft have been,
a Set of People in the World, who really are of
his Acquaintance, and very intimate with him &amp;gt;
and
tho , as I have faid, he has much alter d his
Schemes and chang d Hands of late ) yet that
there are fuch People, perhaps of all Sorts ) and
that the Devil keeps up his Correfpondence with
them&amp;gt; I mutt not venture to deny that Part,
left I
bring upon me the whole PofTe of the con
juring and bewitching Crew, Male and Female,
and they fhould mob me for pretending
to deny
them the Honour of dealing with the Devil^
which they are fo exceeding willing to have the
Fame of.
Not that I am hereby oblig d to believe all the
ftrange Things the Witches and Wizards, who
have been allow d to be fuch, nay, who have been
hang d for it, have faid of themfelves) nay, that
they have confefs d of themfelves, even at the
Gallows; and if I come to have an Occafion to
{peak
400 The Modern HISTORY
fpeak freely of the Matter, I may perhaps con*
vince you that the Devil s
pofleffing Power is
much leflen d of late, and that he either is limit
ed, and his Fetter fliorten d more than it has
been, or that he does not find the old Way (as I
faid before) fo fit for his Purpofe as he did for
merly, and therefore takes other Meafures, but I
mult adjourn that to a Time and Place by itfelf :
But we are told that there are another Sort of Peo
ple^ and, perhaps, a great many of them too, in
whom and by whom the Devil really acts, and
they know it not.
It would take up a great deal of Time and
Room, too much for this Place, fo near the Clofe
of this Work, to defcribe and mark out the in-
Voluntary Devils which there are in the World ;
of whom it
may be truly faid, that really the
Devil is in them, and they know it not :
Now,
tho the Devil is
cunning and managing, and
can be very filent where he finds it for his In-
tereit not to be known j yet it is
very hard for
him to conceal himfelf, and to give fo little Di-
itiirbance in the Houfe, as that the Family fhould
not know who lodg d in it 5 yet, I fay, the De
vil is fo fubtle and fo mifchicvous an Agent, that
he ufes all manner of Methods and Craft to refide
in fuch People as he finds for his Purpofe, whe
ther they will or no, and which is more, whether
they know it or no.
And let none of my Readers be angry or think
themfelves ill tifed, wlien I tell them the Devil
may be in them, and may act them, and by them,
and they not know it , for I muft add, it
may,
perhaps, be one of the greater!:
Pieces of human
Wifdom in the World, for a Man to know when
the Devil is in him, and when not j when he is a
Tool and Agent of Hell, and when he is not 5 in
a Word, when he is
doing the Devil s Work, and
under his Direction, and when not. It
DEVIL: 40I
It is true, this is a very weighty Point, and
might deferve to be handled in a more ferious
Way than I feem to be talking in all this Book*
but give me leave to talk of Things my own
way, and withall, to tell
you, that there is no
Part of this Work fo
fcemingly ludicrous, but
a grave and well weigh d Mind may make a fe
rious and folid
Application of it, if they pleafe*
nor is there any Part of this Work, in which a
clear Sight and a good Senfe may not fee that the
Author s
Defign is, that they fhould do fo \ and
as I am now fo near the End of my Book, I
thought it was meet to tell you fo, and lead you
to it as far as I can.
I fay, tis a great Part of human Wifdom to
know when the Devil is
afting
in us and by us, and
when not 5 the next and ftillgreateft Part would
be to prevent him, put a Stop to hisProgrefs, bid
him go about his Bufinefs, and let him know he
fhould carry on his
Defigns no farther in that
manner 5 that we will be his Tools no longer;
in fhort, to turn him out of Doors, and bring a
ftronger Power to take PofTeffion j but this, in
deed, is too folid a Subject, and too great to be
gin with here.
But now, as to the bare knowing when he is at
work with us, I fay this, tho it is confiderable,
may be done, nor is itfo very difficult &amp;gt;
for Example,
you have no more to do but look a little into the
Microcofm of the Soul, and fee there how the
Paflions which are the Blood, and the Affections
which are the Spirit, move in their particular Vef-
fcls; how they circulate, and in what Temper the
Pulfe beats there, and you may eafily fee who
turns the Wheel &amp;gt;
if a perfect Calm pofTeflcs
the
Soul} if Peace and Temper prevail, and the Mind
feels no Tcmpefts rifing j if the Affections are
regular and exalted to vertuous and fublimc Ob-
D d
402 The
^e6ts,
the Spirits cool, and the Mind fedate, the
Man is in a general Re6Htude of Mind , he
may be truly faid to be his own Man-, Heaven
{bines upon his Soul with its
benign Influences,
and he is out of the Reach of the evil Spirit j for
the divine Spirit is an Influence of Peace, all
calm and bright, happy and fweet like it felf, and
tending to every Thing that is
good both pre-
fent and future.
But on the other Hand, if at any Time the
Mind is ruffled, if Vapours rife, Clouds gather, if
Paffions fwell the Breaft, if Anger, Envy, Re
venge, Hatred, Wrath, Strife j if thefe, or any
of thefe hover over you, much more if you feel
them within you $ if the Affections are poflefs d,
and the Soul hurried down the Stream to em
brace low and bafe Objects j if thofe Spirits, which
are the Life and enlivening Powers of the Soul,
are drawn off to Parties, and to be engag d in a
vicious and corrupt manner, fhooting out wild
and wicked Defires, and running the Man head
long into Crime, the Cafe is eauly refolv d, the
Man is
poffefs d, the Devil is in him j and having
taken the Fort, or at lead the Counterfcarp and
Out-Works, is
making his Lodgment to cover
and fecure himfelf in his Hold, that he may not
be difpoflefs d.
Nor can he be eafily difpofiefs
d when he has
got fuch hold as this j and tis no wonder, that
being lodg d thus upon the Out-Works of the
Soul he continues to fap the Foundation of the
reft, and by his inceflant and furious AiTaults, re
duces the Man at laft to a Surrender.
If the Allegory be not as juft and appofite as
you would have it be, you may, however, fee by
it in a full View, the State of the Man, and
how the Devil carries on his Defigns
-
y nothing
is more common, and I believe there are few
thh&ing
if the DEVIL; 4o 3
thinking Minds but may reflecT:
upon it in their
own Compafs, than for our Paffions and Affefti-
ons to flow out of the ordinary Channel 5 the
Spirits
and Blood of the Soul to be extrayafated,
the Paffions grow violent and outragious, the
Affections impetuous, corrupt and violently vi&quot;
cious: Whence does all this proceed ? from &quot;Hea
ven we can t
pretend it comes j if we muft not
fay tis the Devil, whofe Door muft it lie at?
Pride fwells the Paffions j Avarice moves the
Affedions} and what is Pride, and what is Ava
rice, but the Devil m the Infidc of the Man Pay,
as
perfbnally and really as ever he was in the Herd
of Swine.
Let not any Man then, who is a Slave to his
Paffions, or who is chain d down to his Covet-
oufnefs, pretend to take it illj when I fay he
has the Devil in him, or that he is a Devil :
What elfe can it be, and how comes it to pals
that Paffion and Revenge fo often difpoflels the
Man of himfelf, as to lead him to commit Mur-
ther, to lay Plots and Snares for the Life of his
Enemies, and fo to third for Blood ? How comes
this but by the Devil s
putting thofe Spirits of
the Soul into fo violent a Ferment, into a Fever? *
that the Circulation is
precipitated to that Degree,
and that the Man too is
precipitated into Mifcnief,
and at laft into Ruin &amp;gt;
tis all the Devily tho the
Man does not know it.
In like manner Avarice leads him to rob, plun*
der and deftroy for Money, and to commit fome-
times the word of Violences to obtain the wick
ed Reward. How many have had their Throats
cut for their Money, have been murther d on the
Highway, or in their Beds, for the Defire of
what they had ? It is the fame Thing in other
Articles, every Vice is the Devil in a Man j Luft
of Rule is the Devil of great Men, and that Am-
D d 2 bidon
404- The Modern HISTORY
bition is their Devil as much as whoring is Fa-
thcr *s Devil; one has a Devil of one
Clafs acting him, one another, and every Man s
reigning Vice is a Devil to him.
Thus the Devil has his involuntary Inftruments,
as well as thofe who act in Confederacy with him &amp;gt;
he has a very great Share in many of us, and acts
us, and in us, unknown to our felves tho* we
know nothing of it, and indeed tho we may not
fufpeft it of our felves j like Hazael the jiffyrian^
who when the Prophet told him how he would
act the Devil upon the poor Ifraelites^ anfwer d
with Deteftation, is thy Servant a Dog that he
fhould do this Thing^ and yet he was that Dog,
and did all thofe cruel Things for all that ; the
Devil afting him, or a&ing. in him, to make him
wickeder than ever he thought it was poffible for
him to be.
The CONCLUSION.
Of the Dcvil j laft Scene of Liberty, and
what may befnppofed to be his End, with
what we are to underfland of his being
tormentedfor ever and ever.
AS
the Devil is a Prince of the Power of the
Air, his Kingdom is mortal, and muffc
have an End 5 and as he is call d the God of this
World, that is, the great Ufurper of the Homage
and Reverence which Mankind ought of right
to pay to their Maker, fo his Umrpation alfo,
like the World it felf, mud have an End :
Satan is call d the God of the World, as Men
too
of the DEVIL:
too much proftrate and proftitute themfelves to
him, yet he is not the Governor of this World
and ^
therefore the
Homage and Worfhip he has
from the World is an Ufurpation j and this will
have an End, becaufe the World it felf will have
an Endj and all
Mankind, as they had a
begin
ning in Time, fo muft expire and be remov d be
fore the End of Time.
Since then the Devil s
Empire is to expire and
come to an End, and that the Devil himfelf and
all his Hoft of Devils are immortal Seraphs, Spi
rits that are not embodied and cannot die, but
are to remain in being j the Queftion before us
next will be, what is to become of him ? what is
his State to be? whether is he to wander, and in
what Condition is he to remain to that
Eternity
to which he is ftillto exift ?
I
hope no Man will miftake me fo much in
what I havefaid as to Spirits, which are all
Flame,
not being affe&ed with Fire, as if I fuppofed there
was no Place of Punifhment for the Devil^ nor
any Kind of Punifhment that could affecl: them $
and fo of our Spirits alfo when transformed into
Flame.
I muft be allow d to fpeak there of that mate
rial Fire, by which, as by an Allegory, all the Ter
rors of an eternal State are reprefented to us in
Scripture, and in the Writings of the learned
Commentators, and by which\he Pain of Senfe
is defcrib d &amp;gt;
this, perhaps, I do not underftand
as they feem to do, and therefore have faid,
When we re all Flame (that is all
Spirit) we
lhall all Fire (that is, all fuch Fire as this) defpife.
And thus I claim to be underftood.
It does not follow from hence, neither do
I fugged, or fo much as think that infinite Power
cannot form a fomething (tho* inconceivable to
us here) which ih.aU be as tormenting, and as in-
fupportablc
406 The Modern HISTORY
fupportable to a Devil, an apoftate Seraph, and
to a Spirit, tho exalted, unembodied and ra-
rified into Flame, as Fire would be to other Bo
dies &amp;gt;
in which I think I am orthodox, and do
not give the leaft Occafion to an Enemy to
charge me with profane Speaking, in thofe
Words, or to plead for thinking prophanely him-
felf.
It muft be Atheiftical to the laft
Degree to fug-
geft, that whereas the Devil has been heaping
up and amaffing Guilt ever fince the Creation of
Man, cncreafing in hatred of God and Rebellion
againfl him, and in all
poffible endeavour to de
throne and depofe the Majefly of Heaven j that
yet Heaven had not prepared, or could not pre
pare a juft Penalty for him 3 and that it fhould
not all end in God s entire Victory over Hell,
and in Satan s
open Condemnation: Heaven could
not be juft to its own Glory, if he fhould not
avenge himfelf upon this Rebel, for all his fuper-
lative Wickednefs in his modern as well as an-
tient Station 5 for the Blood of fo many millions
of his faithful Subjects and Saints whom he has
deftroy dj and if
nothing elfe ofFer d it felf to
prove this Part, it would appear undoubted to
me 5 but this, I confefs, does not belong to Satan s
Hiflory, and therefore I have referv d it to this
Place, and fhall alfo be the {hotter in it.
That his Condition is to be a State of Punifh-
jnent, and that by Torment, the Devil himfelf
has own d, and his calling out to our blefled Lord
when he caft him out of the furious Man among
the Tombs, is a Proof of it, What have we to do
with tbee, and art thou come to torment us before the
3*ime? Luke viii. 28. where the Devil acknow-.
ledges four Things, and three of them are dire&amp;lt;3&amp;gt;
ly to my prefent Purpofe, and if you won t believe
the Word of God, I hope you will believe the
of the DEVIL: -
407
Devil i efpccialiy when tis an open Confeffion
againft himfelf.
1 . He confer* Chrift to be trie Son of God (that
by the Way) and no Wanks to himy for that does
not want the Devil s Evidence.
2. He acknowledges he may be tormented.
3. He acknowledges Chrift was able to tor-
nient him.
4. He acknowledges that there is a Time ap
pointed when he fhall be tormented.
As to bow, in what Manner , and by what
Means^ this tormenting the Deviiis to be perform
ed or executed, that 1 take to be as ncedlefs to us
as tis
impoffible to know, and being not at
prefent
inclined to fill
your Heads and Thoughts with
weak and imperfect Guefles, I leave it where I
find it.
It is
enough to us that this Torment of the De
vil is
reprefented to us by Fire, it
being impoffible
for our confin d Thoughts to conceive of Tor
ment by any Thing in the World more cxquifite $
whence I conclude, that Devils fhall at lad receive
a Punifhmcnt fuitable to their fpirituous Nature,
and as
exquifitely Tormenting as a burning Fire
would be to our Bodies.
Having thus fettFd my own Beliefof this Matter,
and flated it
fo, as I think will let
you fee tis
rightly
founded, the Matter ftands thus,
Satan having been let loofe to play his Game
in this World, has improv d his Time to the ut-
mofl -y
he has not fail d on all Occasions to exert
his Hatred, Rage, and Malice at his Conqueror
and Enemy, namely , his Maker $ he has nor fail d,
from Principles of meer Envy and Pride, to purfue
Mankind with all poffible Rancour, in order to de
prive him of the Honour and Felicity which he
was created for, namely, to fucceed the Devil
and his Angels in the State of Glory from which
they fell. This
4os The Modern HIS TORY
This Hatred of God and Envy at Man, having
broken out in fo
many feveral Ways in the whole
Series of Time from the Creation, muft necefTari-
ly have greatly encreafed his Guilt 5 and as Hea
ven is
righteous to judge him, muft terminate in
an encreafe of Piiniihment, adequate to his
Crime,
and fufficient to his Nature.
Some have fuggefted, that there is
yet a Time
to come, when the Devil {hall exert more Rage,
and do more Mifchief than ever yet he has been
permitted to do $ whether he {hall break his
Chain, or be unchain d for a Time, they cannot
tell, nor I neither ; and tis
happy for .my Work,
that even this Part too does not belong to his Hi
ftory ; if ever it (hall be given an Account of by
Mankind, it muft be after it is come to pafs, for
my Part is not Prophefy of foretelling what the
Devil {hall do, but Hiftory of what he has done.
Thus, good People, I have brought the Hiftory
of the Devil down to your own Times \ I have, a$
it&quot;
were, rats d him for you, and fet him in your
View, that you may know him and have a Care
of him. O r -.*&amp;gt;:
If any cunninger Men among you think they
are able now to lay him again, and fo
difpofe of
him out of your Sight, thai you fhall be troubled
no more with him, either here or hereafter, let
them go to work with him their own Wayj you
know Things future do not belong to an Hifto-
rian, fo I leave him among you, wifhing you may
be able to give no worfe an Account of him for
the Time to come, than I have done for the
Time paft.
