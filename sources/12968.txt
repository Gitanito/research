I was mostly unconscious. During the experience, I was a spirit floating in a void above my body. I could see my body lying in bed. I was moving toward this Gateway that had a bright light coming from it. I looked back at my body and then at the Gateway and it became clear to me that if I went into the Gateway I would not go back to my body. I choose life.
