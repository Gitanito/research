  		              		Experience Description   

  I was in a motorcycle accident when a  truck was switching lanes.  I tried unsuccessfully to slide under the middle of the truck. The motorcycle went down.  The police and paramedics came. The police officer was the first responder. He  jacked up the truck because my helmet was stuck under the front axle of the truck. I was evacuated by helicopter to the hospital. A man in the  helicopter told me to stay awake. 

  The next thing I remember was being in a large field. About 100 yards a in front on me, I saw a fence and gate. On the other side of the fence and gate, it looked like a black hole. I was drawn towards the gate. The closer I got,  the more love and warmth I felt and  the more selfishness and bad feelings went away. When I got about five  steps from the gate, I was consumed by it. My hand went to open the gate and someone else’s hand grabbed my forearm, telling  me to 'Stop'. When I looked at the man,  I noticed several people whom I recognized but didn’t know them. 

  One man again reiterated that, 'You need to stop' and continued, 'I’ve been watching you a long-time son and you have made many mistakes. Do you know where you are?'  I looked around and replied, 'I’m not sure.' He said, 'You are death.' I looked around and panicked. He said, 'You scared.' I answered, 'No, I am not.' He then said, 'You’ve always feared this for no reason then.' I shook my head in agreement. 

  Next, he asked me, 'Do you feel in control?' I said, 'No, I do not.' He said, 'You’ve never had control in anything in your life. It’s a veil or facade. You controlled everything in your life and it ultimately was wrong. I shook my head again and said, 'Yes, you are right.' He then said, 'You are be given a choice that many don’t have. God is giving you the choice of going back and fixing the wrongs in your life or you can go through the gate. However, you need to listen and heed these warnings. First, if you go through this gate all of your regrets in life will torment your soul until you are given another chance. It will feel like an eternity.'  Further, he then told me, 'I still deal with  regrets from my past life.' 'If you go back and don’t work on your life to become a better person, you will yearn to be here. If you don’t find Happiness in the right ways, you’ll always looks back to the feeling you have now at this place and yearn for it.' One of the last things he said was, 'When you go back, you’ll regain your health. You will have to regain your heart and mind. You are being given something great, but realize God already knows your choice.' He then looked at me and asked, 'What are you going to do?' I looked at him and said, 'I’m going to go back.' At that point the feelings consuming me left and I let go of the gate. I heard him say, 'I’ll see you again, very soon.' 

  I then woke up and saw my mother. I told her that I’m back permanently and  not going anywhere. She had a face on her and said, 'You’ve been very hurt.' I told her I’ll be fine and that I saw someone. She asked me who I saw.   I old her that  I wasn't sure but I’ve been given a second chance. She laughed and said it was probably your grandfather kicking you in the butt to come back here. 

  I have had multiple surgeries and was told that I wouldn’t be the same physically. I had to relearn to walk, amongst other things. Around a month after the incident, all the images and memories of hurting the people I cared most about hit me. I then have focused and continue to this day focusing on fixing my past and changing my future. Five months later I walk without a limp. I jog miles now and the only  evidence of my accident is the scars. The biggest evidence of the reality of this experience  is the complete change in my personality.
