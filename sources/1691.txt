well worthy of the Induſtrious Aftronomers Óbſervation. This
Defeót is Celebrated in ninteen degrees of the Twins or
the Cºliſtial Gemini, and both Luminaries are in exačt Con

ſumiling Planet Q return'd to the oppoſite places of b and y,

And here give me leave to tell you, That tho I intimated
my Fears of a Pºſtilence the laſt year, and gave ſome Reaſons
alſo of that my Suſpition ; Yet I likewiſe told you, that I
expe&ted no devºuring one then, but rather of your leſſer
Peſtilences, &c. like untô that in 1636. But in this alſo I
was miſtaken in my Judgment.Bleſſed be God for that, I de
fire always to be ſo, when I ſee ground to predićt ill News.
But moſt of the reſt that wrote, were miſtaken, as well as

To ſhew thoſe that are diffident of the Sarry Influences,

Pleaſed to call to mind what a ſupendious year 1683. pro

their ſpoiling more then 3ooo Towns, and carrying away
Saptive 200öoo Chriſtians. Vienna beſieged, and the Turkat

and who conſidering theſe thiugs, will deny an Influence
to great conjunctions, or refuſe to own 1683 for a remarka
bleand prºdigion. Year? |
The Author of Cometomantia, page 198, ſeems to impugne,
and at the ſame time, affirm the g of h, ı, to be ºffen
till. Thus— It is certain that Aptºſs, &c, may ſeniffe
in gºneral, Future. Events; yet contain nºthing in their own Na
tire boding or unfºtunate. Nor are they diſgned (as contts J
to be ſigns of catamitier. For (ſaith he ji I build upon this
ground — Tºtt extraordinry Events are not foreſignified by
ordinary and natural Aéciaents. But, ſuch is the d ?, ?, ſo
much tilked of by the common Prognoſticators, &c. Theſe Planets
fall into ſuch Figures of themſelves, and art the natural ſhiftings of
the Stars, &c. . .
; For anſwer whereto, I demand of him, why are not ſuch
Conjuntiions as Significative and Produćtive alſo, of Future
Events, as himſelf owns Eclipſes to be They are known, alſo
to fall into ſuch Figures of themſelves, as well as theſe.
But if (as He grants.J. They ſignifit Future Events; 'tis as
much as we contend or plead for. We know that the Pla
nets move by a certain Law, which they cannot but Obty;
but yet they may be foreboding for all that. The in &
of cº, from Angles,comes in a natural courſe of order; but
what then? I fly, He that is born under it, and lives to
Maturity, will find cold comfort from the Popularity;or Multi
tude. Alſo, h in C3, in D cº, comes in a natural way,
But Gaſſendus found its ill effitis. The poſition of h in 3,
on the Horoſcope in 8-y, comes in a natural way; but the
late Earl of shaftsbury carried the tuffarnce thereof evenin
his very countinance, and in his Siłe, which had the Tapin it,
to his Grave, which he at laſt found in a timerous wilful
Bariſhment. . . . ‘. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It is not ſufficient to ſay, that extraordinary Events cannot
be ſignified by ordingay Accidents. For it is a Queflion whe.
ther there be anything extraordinary in it ſelf, altho it ſeem
ſºto us, Nihil eſt Nº.4m ſub Sole. There is nothing nºw;

Tº: which is next to be minded, is the unuſual and tâţ.
ous Tranſit of of through the Cºleftial Sagittary this
rear, 1685. A Tranfit as it is not common or frequent, ſo
t is of no ordinary or minute Signification. It levels its
Arows at the great Twin-city, and at all Perſons and places
ſubjećt to II and 2, and probably TK and 3% too; for ſome
Aſtrolºgers do not (as I conceive) unjuſtly, or without Rea
ſon, contend for its concers thorough the whole Quadran
gle, as in Eclipſts. - * * *
shall I give you a ſhort account of the like perambulations
of this turbuleat Planet # (Pardon the word, for ſo he is ge
nerally eſteem’d, the there be others as violent and impe
tuous as he) To begin them. . . . . . . .
You muſi know, that it is not common for dº to be much
above ſix weeks in a Sign, and for him now to be more than
ſº many months, is ſomewhat more than ordinary, tho it be
not more than natural. For Nature hath its wonders, (at leaſt
ſuch they ſeem to us) even in thevery Motions of the Plantts,
as well as in their Effetis, or in the Apparition of contts, nºw
Stars,.&c. Wonderful are all Gods Horks!" --
Nor doth this Motion of dº ſo long together in a sign,
come to paſs in any juſt or equal and proportional number ºf
ſtars; which poſſibly hath been the reaſon, why Aſtronomers,
have been ſo crücified in finding his true place. - -
Sometimes he falls into the like Fight of Motion in 13,
Years time. As from 1512. to 1527. and from 1670. toº
this Year 1685. Sometimes again in 32 years time. “As’
from 1527 to 1359, and from réð6 to 1638, and then to 167c.
Sometimes again in 47 years, as from 1559 to 1éc6, to
|mention no more. , - - *
one might, even from this his Anomalºus motion, conclude
an irregularity and Violence in his Nature and Effids, f wiſh.
