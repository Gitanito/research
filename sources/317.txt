WHO would have thought a year ago, when our Secretary and joint
Founder at length consented to be elected President, that we should
so soon be lamenting his decease '
When Henry Sidgwick died, the Society was orphaned, and now it is
left desolate. Of the original chief founders, Professor Barrett alone
remains ; for Mr. Podmore, the only other member of the first
Council still remaining on it, was not one of the actual founders of
the Society. Neither the wisdom of Sidgwick nor the energy and
power of Myers can by any means be replaced. Our loss is certain,
but the blow must not be paralysing. Rather it must stimulate those
that remain to fresh exertions, must band us together determined
that a group of workers called together for a pioneering work, for
the founding and handing on to posterity of a new science, must not
be permitted to disband and scatter till their work is done. That
work will not be done in our lifetime ; it must continue with what
energy and wisdom we can muster, and we must be faithful to
the noble leaders who summoned us together and laid this burden to
our charge.
I, unworthy, am called to this Chair. I would for every reason that
it could have been postponed ; but it is the wish of your Council ; I am
told that it was the wish of Myers, and I regard it as a duty from
which I must not shrink.
The last communication which my predecessor made was in memory
of Henry Sidgwick : my own first communication must be in memory
of Frederic Myers.
2 Dr. Oliver Lodge. [PART
To how many was he really known ? I wonder. Known in a sense
he was to all, except the unlettered and the ignorant. Known in
reality he was to very few. But to the few who were privileged to
know him, his is a precious memory : a memory which will not decay
with the passing of the years. I was honoured with his intimate
friendship. I esteem it one of the honours of my life.
To me, though not to me alone, falls the duty of doing some
justice to his memory. I would that I might be inspired for the
task.
I was not one of those who knew him as a youth, and my acquaint
ance with him ripened gradually. Our paths in life were wide apart,
and our powers very different : our powers, but not our tastes. He
could instruct me in literature and most other things, I could instruct
him in science ; he was the greedier learner of the two. I never knew
a man more receptive, nor one with whom it was a greater pleasure to
talk. His grasp of science was profound : I do not hesitate to say it,
though many who do not really know him will fail to realise that this
was possible; nor was he fully conscious of it himself. Even into
some of the more technical details, when they were properly pre
sented, he could and did enter, and his mind was in so prepared a
state that any fact once sown in it began promptly to take root and
bud. It was not a detailed knowledge of science that he possessed, of
course, but it was a grasp, a philosophic grasp, of the meaning and
bearing of it all, not unlike the accurately comprehending grasp of
Tennyson ; and again and again in his writings in our Proceedings do
we find the facts which his mind had thus from many sources absorbed
utilised for the purpose of telling and brilliant illustrations, and made
to contribute each its quota to his Cosmic scheme.
For that is what he was really doing, all through this last quarter
of a century : he was laying the foundation for a cosmic philosophy,
a scheme of existence as large and comprehensive and well founded
as any that have appeared.
Do I mean that he achieved such a structure 1 I do not. A
philosophy of that kind is not to be constructed by the labour of
one man, however brilliant; and Myers laboured almost solely on
the psychological side. He would be the first to deprecate any
exaggeration of what he has done, but he himself would have
admitted this,—that he strenuously and conscientiously sought facts,
XLII.] In Memory of F. W. H. Myers. 3
and sought to construct his cosmic foundation by their aid and in
their light, and not in the dark gropings of his own unaided intelli
gence. A wilderness of facts must be known to all philosophers;
the true philosopher is he who recognises their underlying principle
and sees the unity running through them all.
This unity among the more obscure mental processes Myers saw, as
it seems to me, more clearly than any other psychologist ; but what
right have I to speak on psychological problems ? I admit that I
have no right—I only crave indulgence to show the thing as it
appears to me. For authoritative psychology we must hear Professor
William James. He will contribute a memoir, but as I write now
I have heard no word from William James. I express only what
has long been in my mind.
To me it has seemed that most philosophers suffer from a dearth
of facts. In the past necessarily so, for the scientific exploration
of the physical universe is, as it were, a thing of yesterday. Our
cosmic outlook is very different from that of the ancients, is different
even from that of philosophers of the middle of the century, before
the spectroscope, before Darwin and Wallace, before many discoveries
connected with less familiar household words than these : in the
matter of physical science alone the most recent philosopher must
needs have some advantage. But this is a small item in his total
outfit, mental phenomena must contribute the larger part of that ;
and the facts of the mind have been open—it is generally assumed—
from all antiquity. This is in great degree true, and philosophers
have always recognised and made use of these facts, especially those
of the mind in its normal state. Yet in modern science we realise
that to understand a thing thoroughly it must be observed not only
in its normal state but under all the conditions into which it can be
thrown by experiment, every variation being studied and laid under
contribution to the general understanding of the whole.
And, I ask, did any philosopher ever know the facts of the mind
in health and in disease more profoundly, with more detailed and
intimate knowledge, drawn from personal inquiry, and from the
testimony of all the savants of Europe, than did Frederic Myers?
He laid under contribution every abnormal condition studied in the
Salpe'triere, in hypnotic trance, in delirium, every state of the mind
in placidity and in excitement. He was well acquainted with the
4 l)r. Oliver Lodge. [PART
curious facts of multiple personality, of clairvoyant vision, of hallucina
tions, automatisms, self-suggestion, of dreams, and of the waking
visions of genius.
It will be said that Hegel, and to some extent Kant also, as well as
other philosophers, recognised some ultra-normal mental manifestations,
and allowed a place for clairvoyance in their scheme. All honour to
those great men for doing so, in advance of the science of their
time; but how could they know all that we know to-day? Fifty
years ago the facts even of hypnotism were not by orthodox science
accepted; such studies as were made, were made almost surreptitiously,
here and there, by some truth-seeker clear-sighted enough to outstep
the fashion of his time and look at things with his own eyes. But
only with difficulty could he publish his observations, and doubtless
many were lost for fear of ridicule and the contempt of his professional
brethren.
But now it is different : not so different as it ought to be, even yet ;
but facts previously considered occult are now investigated and re
corded and published in every country of Europe. The men who
observe them are too busy to unify them ; they each contribute their
portion, but they do not grasp the whole : the grasping of the whole
is the function of a philosopher. I assert that Myers was that
philosopher.
Do I then in my own mind place him on a pedestal by the side of
Plato and Kant ? God forbid ! I am not one to juggle with great
names and apportion merit to the sages of mankind. Myers' may not
be a name which will sound down the ages as an achiever and builder
of a system of truth ; but I do claim for him that as an earnest pioneer
and industrious worker and clear-visioned student, he has laid a
foundation, perhaps not even a foundation but a corner-stone, on
ground more solid than has ever been available before ; and I hold
that the great quantity of knowledge now open to any industrious
truth-seeker gives a man of modest merit and of self-distrustful powers,
a lever, a fulcrum, more substantial than those by which the great men
of antiquity and of the middle ages were constrained to accomplish
their mighty deeds.
Myers has left behind two unpublished volumes on Human
Personality, has left them, I believe, in charge of Dr. Hodgson—has
left them, alas, not finished, not finally finished ; how nearly finished
XLII.] In Memory of F. W. H. Myers. 5
I do not know. I saw fractions of them some time ago as they left his
pen, and to me they seemed likely to be an epoch-making work.
They are doubtless finished enough : more might have been done,
they might have been better ordered, more highly polished, more
neatly dove-tailed, had he lived; but they represent for all time his
real life work, that for which he was willing to live laborious days ;
they represent what he genuinely conceived to be a message of moment
to humanity : they are his legacy to posterity ; and in the light of the
facts contained in them he was willing and even eager to die.
The termination of his life, which took place at Eome in presence
of his family, was physically painful owing to severe attacks of difficult
breathing which constantly preceded sleep ; but his bearing under it
all was so patient and elevated as to extort admiration from the
excellent Italian doctor who attended him ; and in a private letter
by an eye-witness his departure was described as "a spectacle for
the Gods ; it was most edifying to see how a genuine conviction of
immortality can make a man indifferent to what to ordinary people
is so horrible."
In the intervals of painful difficulty of breathing he quoted from one
of his own poems ("The Renewal of Youth," one which he pre
ferred to earlier and better-known poems of his, and from it alone
I quote) :
"Ah, welcome then that hour which bids thee lie
In anguish of thy last infirmity !
Welcome the toss for ease, the gasp for air,
The visage drawn, and Hippocratic stare ;
Welcome the darkening dream, the lost control,
The sleep, the swoon, the arousal of the soul ! "
Death he did not dread. That is true; and his clear and happy
faith was the outcome entirely of his scientific researches. The years of
struggle and effort and systematic thought had begotten in him a con
fidence as absolute and supreme as is to be found in the holiest martyr
or saint. By this I mean that it was not possible for any one to have
a more absolute and childlike confidence that death was a mere
physical event. To him it was an adversity which must happen
to the body, but it was not one of those evil things which may
assault and hurt the soul.
An important and momentous event truly, even as birth is; a
6 Dr. Oliver Lodge. [PART
temporary lapse of consciousness, even as trance may be ; a waking
up to strange and new surroundings, like a more thorough emigration
than any that can be undertaken on a planet ; but a destruction or
lessening of power no whit. Rather an enhancement of existence,
an awakening from this earthly dream, a casting off of the trammels
of the flesh, and putting on of a body more adapted to the needs
of an emancipated spirit, a wider field of service, a gradual oppor
tunity of re-uniting with the many who have gone before. So he
believed, on what he thought a sure foundation of experience, and
in the strength of that belief he looked forward hopefully to perennial
effort and unending progress :
" Say, could aught else content thee ? which were best,
After so brief a battle an endless rest,
Or the ancient conflict rather to renew,
By the old deeds strengthened mightier deeds to do ?"
Such was his faith : by this he lived, and in this he died. Religious
men in all ages have had some such faith, perhaps a more
restful and less strenuous faith ; but to Myers the faith did not
come by religion : he would have described himself as one who
walked by sight and knowledge rather than by faith, and his eager
life-long struggle for knowledge was in order that he might by no
chance be mistaken.
To some, conviction of this kind would be impossible—they are
the many who know not what science is ; to others, conviction of
this kind seems unnecessary—they are the favoured few who feel
that they have grasped all needed truth by revelation or by intuition.
But by a few here and there, even now, this avenue to knowledge
concerning the unseen is felt to be open. Myers believed that
hereafter it would become open to all. He knew that the multitude
could appreciate science no more, perhaps less, than they can
appreciate religion ; but he knew further that when presently any
truth becomes universally accepted by scientific men, it will penetrate
downwards and be accepted by ordinary persons, as they now accept
any other established doctrine, such as the planetary position of the
earth in the solar system or the evolution of species, not because
they have really made a study of the matter, but because it is a
part of the atmosphere into which they were born.
XLII.] In Memory of F. W. H. Myers. 7
If continuity of existence and intelligence across the gulf of death
really can ever be thus proved, it surely is a desirable and worthy
object for science to aim at. There be some religious men of little
faith who resent this attempted intrusion of scientific proof into their
arena : as if they had a limited field which could be encroached upon.
Those men do not realise, as Myers did, the wealth of their inheritance.
They little know the magnitude of the possibilities of the universe, the
unimagined scope of the regions still, and perhaps for ever, beyond the
grasp of what we now call science.
There was a little science in my youth which prided itself upon being
positive knowledge, and sought to pour scorn upon the possibility, say,
of prayer or of any mode of communication between this world and a
purely hypothetical other. Honest and true and brilliant though
narrow men held these beliefs and promulgated these doctrines for a
time : they did good service in their day by clearing away some super
stition, and, with their healthy breezy common-sense, freeing the mind
from cant,—that is, from the conventional utterance of phrases embody
ing beliefs only half held. I say no word against the scientific men of
that day, to whom were opposed theologians of equal narrowness and
of a more bitter temper. But their warlike energy, though it made
them effective crusaders, left their philosophy defective and their science
unbalanced. It has not fully re-attained equilibrium yet. With Myers
the word science meant something much larger, much more compre
hensive : it meant a science and a philosophy and a religion combined.
It meant, as it meant to Newton, an attempt at a true cosmic scheme.
His was no purblind outlook on a material universe limited and con
ditioned by our poor senses. He had an imagination wider than that
of most men. Myers spoke to me once of the possibility that the parts
of an atom move perhaps inside the atom in astronomical orbits, as the
planets move in the solar system, each spaced out far away from others
and not colliding, but all together constituting the single group or system
we call the atom,—a microcosm akin to the visible cosmos, which again
might be only an atom of some larger whole. I was disposed at that
time to demur. I should not demur now; the progress of science
within the last year or two makes the first part of this thesis even
probable. On the latter part I have still nothing to say. On the former
part much, but not now.
Nor was it only upon material things that he looked with the eye of
8 .Dr. Oliver Lodge. [PART
prescience and of hope. I never knew a man so hopeful concerning his
ultimate destiny. He once asked me whether I would barter, if it were
possible, my unknown destiny, whatever it might be, for as many aeons
of unmitigated and wise terrestrial happiness as might last till the
fading of the sun, and then an end.
He would not ! No limit could satisfy him. That which he was
now he only barely knew,—for to him not the whole of each personality
is incarnate in this mortal flesh, the subliminal self still keeps watch
and ward beyond the threshold, and is in touch always with another
life,—but that which he might come to be hereafter he could by no
means guess : OI'TTW «'./,.< i-./i.-.','.'./ ^L {Vo/«0a. Gradually and perhaps
through much suffering, from which indeed he sensitively shrank,
but through which nevertheless he was ready to go, he believed that
a being would be evolved out of him,—" even," as he would say, " out
of him,"—as much higher in the scale of creation as he now was above
the meanest thing that crawls.
Nor yet an end. Infinity of infinities—he could conceive no end, of
space or time or existence, nor yet of development : though an end of
the solar system and therefore of mankind seemed to him comparatively
imminent :
" That hour may come when Earth no more can keep
Tireless her year-long voyage thro' the deep ;
Nay, when all planets, sucked and swept in one,
Feed their rekindled solitary sun ; —
Nay, when all suns that shine, together hurled,
('rash in one infinite and lifeless world :—
Yet hold thou still, what worlds soe'er may roll,
Naught bear they with them master of the soul ;
In all the eternal whirl, the cosmic stir,
All the eternal is akin to hev ;
She shall endure, and quicken, and live at last,
When all save souls has perished in the past."
Infinite progress, infinite harmony, infinite love, these were the
things which filled and dominated his existence : limits for him were
repellent and impossible. Limits conditioned by the flesh and by
imperfection, by rebellion, by blindness, and by error,—these are
obvious, these he admitted and lamented to the full; but ultimate
limits, impassable barriers, cessation of development, a highest in the
XLII.] In Memory of F. W. H. Myers. 9
scale of being beyond which it was impossible to go,—these he
would not admit, these seemed to him to contradict all that he had
gleaned of the essence and meaning of existence.
Principalities and Powers on and on, up and up, without limit now
and for ever, this was the dominant note of his mind ; and if he seldom
used the word God except in poetry, or employed the customary
phrases, it was because everything was so supremely real to him ;
and God, the personified totality of existence, too blinding a con
ception to conceive.
For practical purposes something less lofty served, and he could
return from cosmic speculations to the simple everyday life, which is for
all of us the immediate business in hand, and which, if patiently
pursued, seemed to him to lead to more than could be desired or
deserved :
" Live thou and love ! so best :md only so
Can thy one soul into the One Soul flow,—
Can thy small life to Life's great centre flee,
And thou l>e nothing, and the Lord in thee."
In all this I do not say he was right—who am I to say that such a
man was right or wrong ?—but it was himself : it was not so much his
creed as himself. He with his whole being and personality, at first
slowly and painfully with many rebuffs and after much delay and
hesitation, but in the end richly and enthusiastically, rose to this
height of emotion, of conviction, and of serenity ; though perhaps to
few he showed it.
" Either we cannot or we hardly dare
Breathe forth that vision into earthly air ;
And if ye call us dreamers, dreamers then
Be we esteemed amid you waking men ;
Hear us or hear not as ye choose ; but we
Speak as we can, and are what we must he."
Not that he believed easily : let no man think that his faith came
easily and cost him nothing. He has himself borne witness to the
struggle, the groanings that could not be uttered. His was a keenly
emotional nature. What he felt, he felt strongly ; what he believed,
he believed in no half-hearted or conventional manner. When he
doubted, he doubted fiercely ; but the pain of the doubt only stimulated
10 Dr. Oliver Lodge. [PART
him to effort, to struggle ; to know at least the worst and doubt no
longer. He was content with no half knowledge, no clouded faith, he
must know or he must suffer, and in the end he believed that he knew.
Seeker after Truth and Helper of his comrades
is a lino in his own metre, though not a quotation, which runs in my
mind as descriptive of him ; suggested doubtless by that line from the
Odyssey which, almost in a manner at his own request, I have placed in
the fore-front of this essay. For he speaks of himself in an in
frequent autobiographical sentence as having " often a sense of great
solitude, and of an effort beyond my strength ; ' striving,'—as Homer
says of Odysseus in a line which I should wish graven on some tablet
in my memory,—' striving to save my own soul and my comrades'
homeward way.' "
But the years of struggle and effort brought in the end ample
recompense, for they gave him a magnificent power to alleviate distress.
He was able to communicate something of his assurance to others, so
that more than one bereaved friend learned to say with him :
"What matter if thou hold thy loved ones prest
Still with close arms upon thy yearning breast,
Or with purged eyes behold them hand in baud
Come in a vision from that lovely land,—
Or only with great heart and spirit sure
Deserve them and await them aud endure ;
Knowing well, no shocks that fall, no years that flee,
Can sunder God from these, or God from thee ;
Nowise so far thy love from theirs can roam
As past the mansions of His endless home."
To how many a sorrowful heart his words have brought hope and
comfort, letters, if ever published, will one day prove. The deep
personal conviction behind his message drove it home with greater
force, nor did it lose influence because it was enfranchised from
orthodox traditions, and rang with no hollow professional note.
If he were right, and if his legacy to the race is to raise it towards
any fraction of his high hopes and feeling of certainty in the dread
presence of death : then indeed we may be thankful for his existence,
and posterity yet unborn will love and honour his memory, as we do
now.

[Postscript to Dr. Lodge's Paper.]
Sir Robert EL Collins—an early friend of Myers'—sends me the
following sketch :
"I FIRST saw Frederic Myers in the early summer of 1864. He was
leaning over the side of a steamer in the harbour of the Piraeus,
reciting poetry to a companion. We became friends on the ship, and
travelled together to Messina, Palermo, Naples, and Rome. This was
his ' Hellenism ' period, and I have never forgotten his enthusiasm,
whether we walked in the country outside Messina and Palermo, where,
he said, all sights and sounds brought Virgil to his memory, or visited
Art Galleries, where he would stand rooted before statues such as the
Faun of Praxiteles.
"At his special desire, we bathed in the troubled waters between
Scylla and Charybdis.
"When, in 1867, I became tutor to the late Duke of Albany, Myers
learned to know the Duke, and the two remained firm and constant
friends till the latter's death. His In Memoriam notice of the Duke
will attest to this. He was at Windsor Castle at the time of Princess
Louise's wedding, and wrote some lines on the event. I do not think
either these lines, or a short poem he wrote by the Queen's request at
the time of the late Duke's confirmation, have been published.
"During the phase of mind under the influence of which Myers wrote
St. Paul, I had frequent opportunities of being with him, and was much
struck with the intensity of his feelings at this time. A common friend
remarked that his face wore ' a chastened look.' He seemed to have
the power, if not of carrying his friends all the way with him in the
special feelings by which he was himself swayed, at least of imbuing
them with something of his attitude of mind. That he was unconscious
of the influence of his personality is shown by his ingenuously remark
ing to me once, that it was strange that we often seemed to undergo
similar changes of thought at the same periods.
" His most striking characteristic, in my opinion, was the eagerness
and ardour with which he identified himself with all matters great and
small that had a real interest to the average human being ; while the
power he possessed of investing such matters with fresh attractions, and
presenting them in novel lights, furnished proof, if proof were needed,
of his extraordinary force and genius.

On Myers as a man of letters the following appreciation has been
written at my request by my colleague, the Professor of
Literature in the University of Birmingham :
" IF students of literature hold resolutely by the touchstone of style, it
is because they find in it a promise of all the major virtues, a sure mark
of the distinguished mind. Amid to-day's welter of uncontrolled and
purposeless verbiage, such work as that of Myers is doubly precious ;
unimpaired by contact with what is weak and worthless in contemporary
writing, it not only shines in itself, but carries on the noble traditions
of our literature. As a man of letters, his distinction was in part due
to the breadth and refinement of his scholarship, which could suffer no
conventional accent, since in his ears ever sounded the language of the
poets who were his lifelong companions, and since he moved along the
difficult paths of philosophical speculation as one familiar with the high
things of the intellectual world.
" His style, always choice, always charged, even surcharged, with
thought, kindled when it touched a subject near his heart into a flame
of brilliance ; his phrases vibrated in unison with his feelings. Eminent
as scholar, psychologist, poet, he has his place as a critic of poetry
in the company of those whose altars smoke with a fire derived from
Heaven. He took his readers captive, not only because his knowledge
was profound, his instinct unfailing, but because by reason of the
emotional and imaginative sympathy with his author of which he was
capable, there is heard in him the note of an almost passionate appre
ciation, of which I believe the palmary example in our language is the
Essay on Virgil. Myers claimed for poetry, as indeed for all high art
—and I do not think the future will disallow the claim—that though
its oracles are not those of a passionless reason or a studious enquiry,
they are none the less authentic revelations that well up from some
unfathomed depth of being, the divine enclasping region where are
wrought the warp and the woof of our mortal life and destiny—
Nee morta.lt smaiis, adflata est numine quando Jam propi&re dei. There
are few, I think, among those who concern themselves seriously with
literature who have not felt his charm, his dignity, his inspiration,
and who have not compared with some disquietude their own coldness
with his strenuous allegiance to the best of which the mind of man
has vision. " W. MACNEILE DIXON."

FREDERIC MYERS'S SERVICE TO PSYCHOLOGY.
BY PROFESSOR WILLIAM JAMKS.
ON this memorial occasion it is from English hearts and tongues
belonging, as I never had the privilege of belonging, to the immediate
environment of our lamented President, that discourse of him as a
man and as a friend must come. It is for those who participated in
the endless drudgery of his labours for our Society to tell of the high
powers he showed there ; and it is for those who have something of
his burning interest in the problem of our human destiny to estimate
his success in throwing a little more light into its dark recesses. To
me it has been deemed best to assign a colder task. Frederic Myers
was a psychologist who worked upon lines hardly admitted by the
more academic branch of the profession to be legitimate; and as for
some years I bore the title of ' Professor of Psychology,' the suggestion
has been made (and by me gladly welcomed) that I should spend my
portion of this hour in defining the exact place and rank which we
must accord to him as a cultivator and promoter of the science of
the Mind.
Brought up entirely upon literature and history, and interested at
first in poetry and religion chiefly ; never by nature a philosopher
in the technical sense of a man forced to pursue consistency among
eoncepts for the mere love of the logical occupation ; not crammed
with science at college, or trained to scientific method by any passage
through a laboratory ; Myers had as it were to re-create his per
sonality before he became the wary critic of evidence, the skilful
handler of hypothesis, the learned neurologist and omnivorous reader
of biological and cosmological matter, with whom in later years we
were acquainted. The transformation came about because he needed
to be all these things in order to work successfully at the problem
that lay near his heart ; and the ardour of his will and the richness
14 Professor William James. [PART
of his intellect are proved by the success with which he underwent
so unusual a transformation.
The problem, as you know, was that of seeking evidence for human
immortality. His contributions to psychology were incidental to that
research, and would probably never have been made had he not
entered on it. But they have a value for Science entirely inde
pendent of the light they shed upon that problem; and it is quite
from it that I shall venture to consider them.
If we look at the history of mental science we are immediately
struck by diverse tendencies among its several cultivators, the conse
quence being a certain opposition of schools and some repugnance among
their disciples. Apart from the great contrasts between minds that
are teleological or biological and minds that are mechanical, between
the animists and the associationists in psychology, there is the entirely
different contrast between what I will call the classic-academic and the
romantic type of imagination. The former has a fondness for clean
pure lines and noble simplicity in its constructions. It explains things
by as few principles as possible and is intolerant of either nondescript
facts or clumsy formulas. The facts must lie in a neat assemblage, and
the psychologist must be enabled to cover them and ' tuck them in ' as
safely under his system as a mother tucks her babe in under the down
coverlet on a winter night. Until quite recently all psychology,
whether animistic or associationistic, was written on classic-academic
lines. The consequence was that the human mind, as it is figured in
this literature, was largely an abstraction. Its normal adult traits were
recognised. A sort of sunlit terrace was exhibited on which it took its
exercise. But where that terrace stopped, the mind stopped; and
there was nothing farther left to tell of in this kind of philosophy but
the brain and the other physical facts of nature on the one hand, and
the absolute metaphysical ground of the universe on the other.
But of late years the terrace has been overrun by romantic improvers,
and to pass to their work is like going from classic to Gothic architec
ture, where few outlines are pure and where uncouth forms lurk in the
shadows. A mass of mental phenomena are now seen in the shrubbery
beyond the parapet. Fantastic, ignoble, hardly human, or frankly non-
human are some of these new candidates for psychological description.
The menagerie and the madhouse, the nursery, the prison, and the
XLII.] Myers's Service to Psychology. 15
hospital, have been made to deliver up their material. The world of
mind is shown as something infinitely more complex than was sus
pected ; and whatever beauties it may still possess, it has lost at any
rate the beauty of academic neatness.
But despite the triumph of romanticism, psychologists as a rule have
still some lingering prejudice in favour of the nobler simplicities.
Moreover there are social prejudices which scientific men themselves
obey. The word 'hypnotism' has been trailed about in the newspapers
so that even we ourselves rather wince at it, and avoid occasions of its
use. 'Mesmerism,' 'clairvoyance,' 'medium,'—Iwrrescimus references/—
and with all these things, infected by their previous mystery-mongering
discoverers, even our best friends had rather avoid complicity. For
instance, I invite eight of my scientific colleagues severally to come to my
house at their own time, and sit with a medium for whom the evidence
already published in our Proceedings had been most noteworthy.
Although it means at worst the waste of the hour for each, five of
them decline the adventure. I then beg the 'Commission' connected
with the chair of a certain learned psychologist in a neighbouring
university to examine the same medium, whom Mr. Hodgson and I
offer at our own expense to send and leave with them. They also
have to be excused from any such entanglement. I advise another
psychological friend to look into this medium's case, but he replies
that it is useless, for if he should get such results as I report, he would
(being suggestible) simply believe himself hallucinated. When I
propose as a remedy that he should remain in the background and take
notes, whilst his wife has the sitting, he explains that he can never
consent to his wife's presence at such performances. This friend of
mine writes ex cathedra on the subject of psychical research, declaring
(I need hardly add) that there is nothing in it; the chair of the psycho
logist with the Commission was founded by a spiritist, partly with a
view to investigate mediums ; and one of the five colleagues who declined
my invitation is widely quoted as an effective critic of our evidence.
So runs the world away ! I should not indulge in the personality and
triviality of such anecdotes, were it not that they paint the temper of
our time, a temper which, thanks to Frederic Myers more than to
any one, will certainly be impossible after this generation. Myers was,
I think, decidedly exclusive and intolerant by nature. But his keen
ness for truth carried him into regions where either intellectual or
16 Professor William, James. [PART
social squeamishness would have been fatal, so he 'mortified' his
amour propre, unclubbed himself completely, and became a model of
patience, tact, and humility wherever investigation required it. Both
his example and his body of doctrine will make this temper the only
one henceforward scientifically respectable.
If you ask me how his doctrine has this effect, I answer : By
co-ordinating ! For Myers' great principle of research was that in order
to understand any one species of fact we ought to have all the species
of the same general class of fact before us. So he took a lot of
scattered phenomena, some of them recognised as reputable, others
outlawed from science, or treated as isolated curiosities; he made
series of iiicm. filled in the transitions by delicate hypotheses or
analogies, and bound them together in a system by his bold inclusive
conception of the Subliminal Self, so that no one can now touch one
part of the fabric without finding the rest entangled with it. Such
vague terms of apperception as psychologists have hitherto been satis
fied with using for most of these phenomena, as ' fraud,' ' rot,'
' rubbish,' will no more be possible hereafter than ' dirt ' is possible
as a head of classification in chemistry, or 'vermin' in zoology.
Whatever they are, they are things with a right to definite description
and to careful observation.
I cannot but account this as a great service rendered to Psychology.
I expect that Myers will ere long distinctly figure in mental science as
the radical leader in what I have called the romantic movement.
Through him for the first time, psychologists are in possession of their
full material, and mental phenomena are set down in an adequate
inventory. To bring unlike things thus together by forming series
of which the intermediary terms connect the extremes, is a procedure
much in use by scientific men. It is a first step made towards
securing their interest in the romantic facts, that Myers should have
shown how easily this familiar method can be applied to their study.
Myers' conception of the extensiveness of the Subliminal Self quite
overturns the classic notion of what the human mind consists in. The
supraliminal region, as Myers calls it, the classic-academic conscious
ness, which was once alone considered either by associationists or
animists, figures in his theory as only a small segment of the psychic
spectrum. It is a special phase of mentality, tdeologically evolved for
adaptation to our natural environment, and forms only what he calls
XLII.] Myers's Service to Psychology. 17
a 'privileged case' of personality. The outlying Subliminal, according
to him, represents more fully our central and abiding being.
I think the words subliminal and supraliminal unfortunate, but they
were probably unavoidable. I think, too, that Myers's belief in the
ubiquity and great extent of the Subliminal will demand a far larger
number of facts than sufficed to persuade him, before the next
generation of psychologists shall become persuaded. He regards the
Subliminal as the enveloping mother-consciousness in each of us, from
which the consciousness we wot of is precipitated like a crystal. But
whether this view get confirmed or get overthrown by future inquiry,
the definite way in which Myers has thrown it down is a new and
specific challenge to inquiry. For half a century now, psychologists
have fully admitted the existence of a subliminal mental region, under
the name either of unconscious cerebration or of the involuntary life ;
but they have never definitely taken up the question of the extent of
this region, never sought explicitly to map it out. Myers definitely
attacks this problem, which, after him, it will be impossible to ignore.
IPhat is the precise constitution of the Subliminal—such is the problem
which deserves to figure in our Science hereafter as the problem of
Myers ; and willy-nilly, inquiry must follow on the path which it has
opened up. But Myers has not only propounded the problem defin
itely, he has also invented definite methods for its solution. Post-
hypnotic suggestion, crystal-gazing, automatic writing and trance-speech,
the willing-game, etc., are now, thanks to him, instruments of research,
reagents like litmus paper or the galvanometer, for revealing what
would otherwise be hidden. These are so many ways of putting
the Subliminal on tap. Of course without the simultaneous work
on hypnotism and hysteria independently begun by others, he could
not have pushed his own work so far. But he is so far the only
generalizer of the problem and the only user of all the methods ;
and even though his theory of the extent of the Subliminal should
have to be subverted in the end, its formulation will, I am sure,
figure always as a rather momentous event in the history of our
Science.
Any psychologist who should wish to read Myers out of the pro
fession—and there are probably still some who would be glad to do so
to-day—is committed to a definite alternative. Either he must say
that we knew all about the subliminal region before Myers took it up,
18 Professor William James. [PART
or he must say that it is certain that states of super-normal cognition
form no part of its content. The first contention would be too absurd.
The second one remains more plausible. There are many first hand
investigators into the Subliminal who, not having themselves met with
anything super-normal, would probably not hesitate to call all the
reports of it erroneous, and who would limit the Subliminal to dissolutive
phenomena of consciousness exclusively, to lapsed memories, sub
conscious sensations, impulses and phobias, and the like. Messrs. Janet
and Binet, for aught I know, may hold some such position as this.
Against it Myers's thesis would stand sharply out. Of the Subliminal,
he would say, we can give no ultra-simple account : there are discrete
regions in it, levels separated by critical points of transition, and no
one formula holds true of them all. And any conscientious psycholo
gist ought, it seems to me, to see that, since these multiple modifica
tions of personality are only beginning to be reported and observed
with care, it is obvious that a dogmatically negative treatment of them
must be premature, and that the problem of Myers still awaits us as
the problem of far the deepest moment for our actual psychology,
whether his own tentative solutions of certain parts of it be correct
or not.
Meanwhile, descending to detail, one cannot help admiring the great
originality with which Myers wove such an extraordinarily detached
and discontinuous series of phenomena together. Unconscious cerebra
tion, dreams, hypnotism, hysteria, inspirations of genius, the willing-
game, planchette, crystal-gazing, hallucinatory voices, apparitions of the
dying, medium-trances, demoniacal possession, clairvoyance, thought-
transference—even ghosts and other facts more doubtful—these things
form a chaos at first sight most discouraging. No wonder that
scientists can think of no other principle of unity among them than
their common appeal to men's perverse propensity to superstition. Yet
Myers has^actually made a system of them, stringing them continuously
upon a [perfectly legitimate objective hypothesis, verified in some cases
and extended to others by analogy. Taking the name automatism
from the phenomenon of automatic writing—I am not sure that he
may not himself have been the first so to baptize this latter pheno
menon—he made one great simplification at a stroke by treating
hallucinations and active impulses under a common head, as sensory
and motor automatisms. Automatism he then conceived broadly as a
XLII.] Myers's Service to Psychology. 19
message of any kind from the Subliminal to the Supraliminal. Afid he
went a step farther in his hypothetic interpretation, when he insisted
on 'symbolism' as one of the ways in which one stratum of our
personality will often interpret the influences of another. Obssessive
thoughts and delusions, as well as voices, visions, and impulses, thus
fall subject to one mode of treatment. To explain them, we must
explore the Subliminal ; to cure them we must practically influence it.
Myers's work on automatism led to his brilliant conception, in 1891,
of hysteria. He defined it, with good reasons given, as " a disease of
the hypnotic stratum." Hardly had he done so when the wonderfully
ingenious observations of Binet, and especially of Janet in France, gave
to this view the completest of corroborations. These observations have
been extended in Germany, America, and elsewhere ; and although
Binet and Janet worked independently of Myers, and did work far
more objective, he nevertheless will stand as the original announcer
of a theory which, in my opinion, makes an epoch, not only in
medical, but in psychological science, because it brings in an entirely
new conception of our mental possibilities.
Myers's manner of apprehending the problem of the Subliminal
shows itself fruitful in every possible direction. While official science
practically refuses to attend to Subliminal phenomena, the circles which
do attend to them treat them with a respect altogether too undiscrimi-
nating—every Subliminal deliverance must be an oracle. The result
is that there is no basis of intercourse between those who best know
the facts and those who are most competent to discuss them. Myers
immediately establishes a basis by his remark that in so far as they
have to use the same organism, with its preformed avenues of ex
pression—what may be very different strata of the Subliminal are
condemned in advance to manifest themselves in similar ways. This
might account for the great generic likeness of so many automatic
performances, while their different starting-points behind the threshold
might account for certain differences in them. Some of them, namely,
seem to include elements of supernormal knowledge ; others to show a
curious subconscious mania for personation and deception ; others again
to be mere drivel. But Myers's conception of various strata or levels
in the Subliminal sets us to analyzing them all from a new point of view.
The word Subliminal for him denotes only a region, with possibly the
most heterogeneous contents. Much of the content is certainly rubbish,
20 Professor William James. [PART
matted that Myers calls dissolutive, stuff that dreams are made of,
fragments of lapsed memory, mechanical effects of habit and ordinary
suggestion ; some belongs to a middle region where a strange manu
facture of inner romances perpetually goes on ; finally, some of the
content appears superiorly and subtly perceptive. But each has to
appeal to us by the same channels and to use organs partly trained to
their performance by messages from the other levels. Under these
conditions what could be more natural to expect than a confusion,
which Myers's suggestion would then have been the first indispensable
step towards finally clearing away.
Once more, then, whatever be the upshot of the patient work
required here, Myers's resourceful intellect has certainly done a service
to psychology.
I said a while ago that his intellect was not by nature philosophic in
the narrower sense of being that of a logician. In the broader sense
of being a man of wide scientific imagination, Myers was most
eminently a philosopher. He has shown this by his unusually daring
grasp of the principle of evolution, and by the wonderful way in which
he has worked out suggestions of mental evolution by means of bio
logical analogies. These analogies are, if anything, too profuse and
dazzling in his pages; but his conception of mental evolution is more
radical than anything yet considered by psychologists as possible. It
is absolutely original; and, being so radical, it becomes one of those
hypotheses which, once propounded, can never be forgotten, but soon
or later have to be worked out and submitted in every way to criticism
and verification.
The corner-stone of his conception is the fact that consciousness has
no essential unity. It aggregates and dissipates, and what we call
normal consciousness,—the ' Human Mind ' of classic psychology,—is
not even typical, but only one case out of thousands. Slight organic
alterations, intoxications and auto-intoxications, give supraliminal forms
completely different, and the subliminal region seems to have laws in
many respects peculiar. Myers thereupon makes the suggestion that
the whole system of consciousness studied by the classic psychology is
only au extract from a larger total, being a part told-off, as it were, to
do service in the adjustments of our physical organism to the world of
nature. This extract, aggregated and personified for this particular
purpose, has, like all evolving things, a variety of peculiarities. Having
XLII.] Myers's Service to Psychology. 21
evolved, it may also dissolve, and in dreams, hysteria, and divers
forms of degeneration it seems to do so. This is a retrograde process
of separation in a consciousness of which the unity was once effected.
But again the consciousness may follow the opposite course and
integrate still farther, or evolve by growing into yet untried directions.
In veridical automatisms it actually seems to do so. It drops some of
its usual modes of increase, its ordinary use of the senses, for example,
and lays hold of bits of information which, in ways that we cannot
even follow conjecturally, leak into it by way of the Subliminal. The
ulterior source of a certain part of this information (limited and per
verted as it always is by the organism's idiosyncrasies in the way of
transmission and expression) Myers thought he could reasonably trace
to departed human intelligence, or its existing equivalent. I pretend
to no opinion on this point, for I have as yet studied the evidence with
so little critical care that Myers was always surprised at my negli
gence. I can therefore speak with detachment from this question and,
as a mere empirical psychologist, of Myers's general evolutionary
conception. As such a psychologist I feel sure that the latter is a
hypothesis of first-rate philosophic importance. It is based, of course,
on his conviction of the extent of the Subliminal, and will stand or fall
as that is verified or not ; but whether it stand or fall, it looks to me
like one of those sweeping ideas by which the scientific researches of
an entire generation are often moulded. It would not be surprising
if it proved such a leading idea in the investigation of the near future ;
for in one shape or another, the Subliminal has come to stay with us,
and the only possible course to take henceforth is radically and
thoroughly to explore its significance.
Looking back from Frederic Myers's vision of vastness in the field
of psychological research upon the programme as most academic
psychologists frame it, one must confess that its limitation at their
hands seems not only unplausible, but in truth, a little ridiculous.
Even with brutes and madmen, even with hysterics and hypnotics
admitted as the academic psychologists admit them, the official out
lines of the subject are far too neat to stand in the light of analogy with
the rest of Nature. The ultimates of Nature, —her simple elements, if
there be such,—may indeed combine in definite proportions and follow
classic laws of architecture ; but in her proximates, in her phenomena
22 Professor William, James. [PART
as we immediately experience them, Nature is everywhere gothic, not
classic. She forms a real jungle, where all things are provisional, half-
fitted to each other, and untidy. When we add such a complex kind of
subliminal region as Myers believed in to the official region, we restore
the analogy ; and, though we may be mistaken in much detail, in a
general way, at least, we become plausible. In comparison with
Myers's way of attacking the question of immortality in particular, the
official way is certainly so far from the mark as to be almost pre
posterous. It assumes that when our ordinary consciousness goes out,
the only alternative surviving kind of consciousness that could be
possible is abstract mentality, living on spiritual truth, and communi
cating ideal wisdom—in short, the whole classic platonizing Sunday-
school conception. Failing to get that sort of thing when it listens to
reports about mediums, it denies that there can be anything. Myers
approaches the subject with no such a priori requirement. If he finds
any positive indication of ' spirits,' he records it, whatever it may be,
and is willing to fit his conception to the facts, however grotesque the
latter may appear, rather than to blot out the facts to suit his
conception. But, as was long ago said by our collaborator, Mr.
Canning Schiller, in words more effective than any I can write, if
any conception should be blotted out by serious lovers of Nature,
it surely ought to be the classic academic Sunday-school conception.
If anything is wrelikely in a world like this, it is that the next adjacent
thing to the mere surface-show of our experience should be the realm
of eternal essences, of platonic ideas, of crystal battlements, of absolute
significance. But whether they be animists or associationists, a
supposition something like this is still the assumption of our usual
psychologists. It comes from their being for the most part philoso
phers in the technical sense, and from their showing the weakness
of that profession for logical abstractions. Myers was primarily a
lover of life and not of abstractions. He loved human life, human
persons, and their peculiarities. So he could easily admit the possi
bility of level beyond level of perfectly concrete experience, all
' queer and cactus-like ' though it might be, before we touch the
absolute, or reach the eternal essences.
Behind the minute anatomists and the physiologists, with their metallic
instruments, there have always stood the out-door naturalists with
their eyes and love of concrete nature. The former call the latter
XLII.] Myers's Service to Psychology. 23
superficial, but there is something wrong about your laboratory-
biologist who has no sympathy with living animals. In psychology
there is a similar distinction. Some psychologists are fascinated by the
varieties of mind in living action, others by the dissecting out, whether by
logical analysis or by brass instruments, of whatever elementary mental
processes may be there. Myers must decidedly be placed in the former
class, though his powerful use of analogy enabled him also to do work
after the fashion of the latter. He loved human nature as Cuvier
and Agassiz loved animal nature ; in his view, as in their view, the
subject formed a vast living picture. Whether his name will have in
psychology as honourable a place as their names have gained in the
sister science, will depend on whether future inquirers shall adopt or
reject his theories ; and the rapidity with which their decision shapes
itself will depend largely on the vigour with which this Society
continues its labour in his absence. It is at any rate a possibility, and
I am disposed to think it a probability, that Frederic Myers will
always be remembered in psychology as the pioneer who staked out a
vast tract of mental wilderness and planted the flag of genuine science
upon it. He was an enormous collector. He introduced for the
first time comparison, classification, and serial order into the peculiar
kind of fact which he collected. He was a genius at perceiving
analogies ; he was fertile in hypotheses ; and as far as conditions
allowed it in this meteoric region, he relied on verification. Such
advantages are of no avail, however, if one has struck into a false
road from the outset. But should it turn out that Frederic Myers
has really hit the right road by his divining instinct, it is certain
that, like the names of others who have been wise, his name will
keep an honourable place in scientific history.

ami, de rappeler quelques souvenirs personnels. En donnant a notre

emotion respectueuse cette forme concrete, .et pour ainsi dire anec-
dotiqae, nous resterons tres pres de lui encore. Heureux si je puis
faire revivre la souvenir de celui qui a <he notre inspirateur et notre
guide a tous.
C'est a 1'occasion des premieres experiences publiees par la Societe
des recherches psychiques que j'entrai en relation avec Myers et
Gurney, et tout de suite, apres echange de quelques lettres, la
sympathie fut profonde.
Je lui racontai ce que j'avais vu, et je lui fis part de mes esperances.
Elles etaient moins vastes que les siennes, et tout d'abord j'etais trim-
de 1'accuser de cr&lulite, mais peu a peu il arriva a me convaincre,
si bien que presque malgre moi, toutes les fois que j'avais un peu
longuement cause avec lui, je me sentais ensuite comme transforms.
Peu d'hommes autant que lui ont exerce une influence directrice
sur ma pensee. Je trouvais en effet en lui non pas cette foi
aveugle et credule qui accepte toutes les fantaisies qu'une imagination
sans critique severe inspire a ses enthousiastes ; mais le culte de la
rigueur scientifique, 1'amour de la precision et une Erudition sure,
sagace et perspicace. Aussi, toutes les fois que quelque phenomene
interessant dans le domaine des sciences occultes se presentait a moi,
ma premiere pensee etait-elle toujours : " il faudra montrer cela a
Myers, et savoir ce qu'il en pense."
Et c'est ainsi que nous avons pu tous deux, en maintes occasions, a
Calmar en Suede, en Saxe a Zwickau, a File Ribaud en France, a Paris
et a Cambridge, etudier ensemble quelques uns de ces phenomenes
deconcertants, compliques, qui par le melange du vrai avec le faux
semblent defier a la foi notre scepticisme et notre credulite.
Je ne peux me rappeler sans emotion ces voyages, ces excursions
channantes oii 1'esprit de Myers se livrait tout entier. Attentif aux
moindres details, scrutant toutes les conditions experimentales, proposant
des dispositions ingenieuses, infatigable dans son activity a la recherche,
inalterable dans sa confiance, il relevait mon courage souvent abattu,
et ne me permettait pas le desespoir ou le decouragement. Com-
bien de fois n'avons-nous pas cru avoir surpris la clef du grand mystere !
Et quelle energie ne lui fallait-il pas pour ne pas se laisser troubler
par la surprise de quelque miserable incident, qui nous faisait retomber
& terre apres avoir con^u de sublimes esperances !
Certes, si je suis reste, malgr6 tout, confiant dans la science des

phenomenes psychiques, c'est ;'t lui que je le dois. Sans lui, je serais
revenu, probablement sans retour, a la science classique, positive, cette
science dont il ne faut jamais dire de mal ; car c'est la base la plus
solide sur laquelle puisse s'affirmer une conviction, mais enfin dont on
peut, sans calomnie, dire que ses vues sont parfois tres courtes.
Si nous ne devions accepter que ce qui est prouve d'une maniere
absolument irrefutable, nous serions reduits a bien peu de chose. Le
mecanisme du monde ambiant est un mecanisme assez grossier, dont
nous connaissons, tant bien que mal, les termes principaux ; mais
nous avons soif d'aller au-dela. II nous faut autre chose que ce
mecanisme dont nous ne comprenons meme pas 1'essence. Nous avons
besoin d'hypotheses plus hardies. Et la science ne peut vivre sans
ces hypotheses, qui s'avancent beauconp plus loin que les demon-
strations : pour fe'conder la science, 1'hypothese est necessaire. Certes
la critique scientifique est indispensable ; mais il faut savoir distinguer
entre 1'audace qui con9oit toutes les plus grandioses hypotheses, et la
severite scientifique qui n'admet que la demonstration impeccable.
Voila ce qui rendait Pinfluence de F. Myers si profonde ; c'est qu'il
avait une audace sans limite dans ses hypotheses. II croyait ferme-
ment a un autre monde—moins grossier et moins barbare que le monde
m6canique qui frappe nos vues rudimentaires ;—mais il ne se croyait
pas pour cela, comme tant de spirites, helas ! autorise a negliger les
regies d'une precision experimentale scrupuleuse.
A 1'lle Kibaud, quand avec Lodge et Ochorowicz nous etions en
presence des faits extraordinaires fournis par Eusapia Paladino, que de
longues et attachantes conversations sur tous ces grands problemes qui
nous passionnaient ! Ce temps passe, deja lointain, restera un des
souvenirs les plus charmants de ma vie. Et dans cette hospitaliere
maison de Leckhampton, oii j'ai passe de si douces heures, que de
souvenirs encore je pourrais evoquer !
C'est a Myers qu'est du pour une bonne part le succes des congres
internationaux de psychologie, Paris 1889, Londres 1893, Munich
1896, Paris 1900. Grace a lui un accord, qui paraissait a premiere vue
impossible, a pu etre realise : 1'union entre la science psychologique
classique et la science psychique, cette psychologie future a laquelle
notre illustre ami travaillait avec tant d'ardeur. Ce n'etait pas precise-
ment une tache facile que d'apprivoiser les psychologues et philosophes
de profession, accoutumes a lire Platon, Aristote, Locke et Kant plus

qu'a etudier les phenomenes de trance, et d'hypnose. Pourtant Myers y
a reussi. II a pu introduire dans les seances de ces congres les donnees
des sciences, si mal a propos dites occultes, la telepathic, les premoni
tions, la suggestion mentale, etc. Non pas qu'il ait voulu faire penetrer
de vive force ces connaissances dans les esprits rebelles, mais au moins
a-t-il fait admettre qu'elles avaient quelque valeur, qu'il fallait les
discuter, et non les repousser par des h priori dedaigneux. Nul plus
que lui n'etait qualifie pour cette reconciliation ; sa parole etait toujours
respected ; ses conseils toujours ecoutes. S'il a ete parfois blame par les
spirites qui le trouvaient trop timide, il a etc non moins energiquement
accuse de temerite par les philosophes , mais les uns et les autres,
spirites et philosophes, etaient, en derniere analyse, forces de s'incliner
devant la rigueur de sa dialectique, et la -.••* rni .. de ses methodiques
critiques.
Assurement Myers n'a pas assiste au triomphe definitif de son
O3uvre—quand done un triomphe est-il definitif 1 Mais au moins il aura vu
1'evolution, provoquee par lui, grandir rapidement. Aujourd'hui personne
ne raille plus ceux qui parlent de telepathic et de pressentiments, et de
suggestion mentale, et d'autres phenomenes encore, qui excitaient il y a
vingt ans les plaisanteries et presque la commiseration des personnes soi-
disant raisonnables. Aujourd'hui, grace £ Myers et a ses vaillants
collaborateurs, tout un monde nouveau nous est offert, et il faut, en
explorateure que rien n'effraie, y penetrer. La tache est devenue plus
facile. Le chemin est largement ouvert. L'indifference et 1'hostilite
du public et des savants officiels ont ete vaincues. Tous les hommes
qui refl6chissent ont fini par comprendre qu'il y a la des tresors de
verites nouvelles ; plus vraies et plus fecondes que toutes les verites
anciennes. Ce n'est pas le renversement de la science d'autrefois ;
c'est 1'avenement d'une science inconnue, riche en promesses, et meme
ayant deja donne un peu plus que des promesses.
La derniere fois que j'ai vu Myers, ce fut en aout 1900, a ce Congres

IV.
F. W. H. MYERS AND THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL
RESEARCH.
BY FRANK PODMORE.
THE Society for Psychical Research stands now at a critical point in
its history. In Frederic Myers we have lost the last of the brilliant
trinity of Cambridge men who, in conjunction with Professor
Barrett, founded the Society in 1882. Myers had of course made his
name known in other fields before the Society was formed. His
early work, St. Paul, marked him out as a poet of high and original
quality ; his essays on various literary themes, classical and modern,
had won for him the appreciation of scholars. Had he devoted himself
to such pursuits there can be little doubt that he would have taken a
high place in the Victorian age of English literature. But from early
manhood, or perhaps even from boyhood, he had been possessed with
that passion for the quest of immortality which he himself so well
described a few weeks before his death, in his memorial address on
Henry Sidgwick. Prior to 1882 he had joined a small circle, of
whom Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick and Edmund Gurney were the
other leading members, to investigate the phenomena of Spiritualism,
and had later assisted at Professor Barrett's experiments in thought-
transference.
From the foundation of the Society he threw all his energies into its
work, and after Edmund Gurney's death took a large part of the
routine duties in addition to the more congenial task of research.
Only those who have worked with him can know how heavy a burden
of dull business details incidental to the management of an organisa
tion like ours Myers cheerfully undertook to bear. To his activity in
other directions the fifteen volumes of our Proceedings, to which he
contributed a preponderant share, bear eloquent witness. Again, though
the writing of the book was the task of Edmund Gurney, Myers played a.
30 Frank Podmore. [PART
considerable part in collecting the material for Phantasms ofthe Living, and
was largely responsible for the classification of the cases finally adopted.
Probably the achievement which he would himself have regarded
as most expressive of his personality, and which it seems likely will
ultimately be accepted by dispassionate critics as possessing the
highest permanent value, is his prolonged investigation into the
powers and manifestations of what he has happily named the Sub
liminal Self. Those who are unable to accept, without large
qualification and deduction, the conclusions at which he has arrived
can yet unreservedly admire the characteristic qualities of his genius
as here exhibited. We admire first his full and comprehensive survey
of the whole field, and the amazing industry on which that com
prehensive survey is based. As Edmund Gurney, himself a student
of no mean capacity, once said to me, "Whilst I am reading a book,
Myers will master a literature."
Next we note the extraordinary power of generalisation and classifi
cation displayed. Professor James and Dr. Lodge have already described
Myers' power of bringing together a vast assemblage of heterogeneous
phenomena, pointing out their resemblances and analogies, and uniting
them in a common system. Not only did he thus bring the whole
field of enquiry—a feat never attempted before—into one comprehensive
survey, but he carried his genius for classification into each particular
part of the whole area. One of the most striking examples of this
is afforded by his treatment of the material dealt with in Phantasms
of the Living. We had placed before us an immense mass of apparently
diverse and heterogeneous observations—dreams, visions, banshees,
corpse-lights, apparitions at death, fetches, doubles, and so on. The
idea that all these various phenomena might be explained as due
to the action of one mind upon another was the common property
from the outset of those who had founded the Society. But it
was mainly owing to Myers that the idea was embodied in pro
visional categories and expressed by a notation hardly less com
pendious than that of chemistry. Briefly, the various phenomena were
grouped according to the state of agent or percipient, whether the one
or the other were at the time of the occurrence in the normal waking
state, or asleep, or in trance, delirium, illness, or dying. Thus, when
a percipient in full possession of his waking faculties saw an apparition
of a friend shortly before his death, the occurrence would be classed
XLII.] F. W. H. Myera and the S. P. R. 31
as Ad P" (agent dying, percipient normal). If two persons sleep
ing in different rooms had a common dream, it would be noted as
A' P' (agent sleeping, percipient sleeping). Other instances of the
notation will be remembered by all who are familiar with his
articles on the Subliminal Self. It is to be noted that this power of
systematisation is of great practical value, even though later knowledge
should lead ultimately to quite other principles of arrangement. The
mere ability to bring together a vast number of scattered observations,
to point out some of their common characteristics, and to group them
in a provisional scheme, is a sufficiently rare endowment, and, in
an investigation like ours, of the highest possible utility. However
incomplete and rough and ready the classification may be—and Myers'
schemes were by no means rough and ready—it facilitates discussion
and at once directs and stimulates further investigation.
Closely connected with this power of classification was Myers' extra
ordinary fertility in suggestion and hypothesis. He was always seeing
analogies that previous observers had overlooked ; always bringing
together from the furthest extremities of the field phenomena seemingly
the most diverse and demonstrating their essential resemblance. It
is this faculty which makes his writings so perpetually suggestive and
provocative of thought. Those who differ most widely from some of
his conclusions cannot read his works without gaining innumerable
hints for their guidance, glimpses of new order and harmony in the
material, and unimagined side-lights on old problems.
On Myers' gift of expression there is no need to dwell at length, in
this place least of all. Every volume of the Proceedings up to the
present time has been graced by some article from his pen. The most
impressive characteristic of his style, however, was not the splendour
of the diction, the unequalled command over the literary stores alike of
classical and modern times, or even his rich imaginative endowment,
but his instinct on occasion for the inevitable word. In his more
studied utterances the language might seem at times overweighted
by its own riches, by the abundance of the imagery, by the embar
rassment of quotation and allusion. It was when he chose to be
brief, and of many good things to select only the best, that his
style reached perhaps its highest point of effectiveness. It would be
difficult to surpass the art shown in the brief obituary notices of our
distinguished members which he contributed to the Journal of the
32 Frank Podmore. [PART
Society ; in his replies to attack in outside periodicals ; and in some
of the brief speeches at our meetings which were delivered to
meet an unrehearsed emergency. It is pertinent to remark in this
connection that our psychical vocabulary is largely owing to Myers ;
amongst his best known coinages are telepathy, supernormal, veridical.
But there is no need to dwell upon an aspect of his intellectual
equipment which is familiar to us all. It is perhaps not so well
recognised that much of his work was scarcely less finished from
a scientific than from a literary standpoint. His conscientiousness
as an artist was no doubt born with him ; his conscientious thorough
ness as an investigator was more gradually and laboriously acquired.
That he did display so much care and thoroughness in the tedious
task of investigation is, in a man of his temperament, not the least
of his achievements.
No trait in his character was more conspicuous than the tolerance
of opinions at variance with his own. His deference indeed to any
expression of adverse views was so marked that it can best be
described as docility. At our Council meetings, whilst few were so
well qualified to form an opinion, no one was more reluctant to
seem to press his own. He was always open to suggestions from
whatever quarter. Part of this deference to any expression of opinion
was no doubt the simple outcome of a finished courtesy. But it had
its roots, I think, deeper than this. It was most marked in his atti
tude towards Henry Sidgwick. Myers was always ready to defer, and
set us the example of deferring, to any opinion in matters of policy
and conduct deliberately expressed by Professor Sidgwick. That
instant recognition of Sidgwick's true insight and sure judgment,
the truest and surest that any of us have known, was a tribute
that honoured the giver not less than the recipient.
Myers' life, happy in its strenuous activities, was happiest of all
perhaps in its conviction of another life to follow. Various symptoms
had given warning of his approaching end, and in November last,
writing to tell me that his own expectations of an early death had
lately received medical confirmation, he spoke of himself as looking
forward to the great change, and "disposed to count the days till
the holidays."

F. W. H. MYERS AS A MAN OF LETTERS.
BY WALTER LKAF, Litt.D.
MYERS has a right to a place among the foremost writers of our day ;
but it seems hardly likely that this right will ever be duly recognised.
Whether it be or not is a question with which we may concern our
selves the less as it is certain that Myers himself did not greatly care.
He had within his grasp a high reputation as poet and essayist, and
deliberately sacrificed it to yet higher moral purposes. As years went
on he addressed himself less and less to men of letters, seeking ever
more consciously only the narrower audience which cared for the
one subject engrossing his own energies aud ambitions. Hence it
is that to the world at large he is above all the author of St. Paul,
his least mature work ; and even the Times is capable of attributing
to him what was written by his brother.
Until the publication of his nearly finished book on Human Person
ality and its Survival of Bodily Death, which will give him his final
place both as thinker and writer, nearly all his most mature and finest
work must be sought in the publications of the S.P.R. St. Paul is not
forgotten, nor should it be ; for it is the work of a real poet. But it is
easy to point out in it the obvious faults of youth—too exuberant
imagination, too gorgeous colouring, excessive love of resonant phrase
and dominant harmony. One small volume contains all the published
verse of the rest of his life ; but it shows how he had learnt to control
the temptations which tended to lead him astray, and guide his
fertility towards one high aim. But it is in his later prose that this
power of chastening and self-mastery is best seen, ever gaining ground
and strengthening his style till he had attained something like perfection
in his art. The poet's imagination is always there ; under his touch no
discussion is arid ; flashes of insight light up alike the darkness of the
subliminal self and the dreary inanities of automatic writing. But
C
34 Dr. Walter Leaf. ' [PART
no word is used merely for the effect of the moment ; all subserve the
moral end.
It is this ethical tendency which is the real bond between all his
published essays. His literary sense was almost abnormally acute ;
but his criticism always leads up to one great question, by which he
judges alike Virgil and Mazzini, Victor Hugo, Tennyson, Marcus
Aurelius and Renan—what attitude does the poet, the historian, the
statesman take towards the great riddle of life ? What sense has he of
the interaction of the world unseen in the things of this life 1 What
lesson has genius, the " uprush from the subliminal self," brought to
man from behind the veil ? Even in the essay on Greek Oracles, which
was I believe the first published of his prose works, this desire for
knowledge of the spiritual mysteries was the leading thought—hardly
apparent to the careless reader at first, but clearly indicated in the
notes added to the later editions. It can be traced through the other
essays Classical and Modern, till in the later volume, Science and a
Future Life, it is the avowed and only subject.
Side by side with the ethical interest grows the scientific, till the
threefold cord of goodness, truth, and beauty is twined in harmony.
Each reinforces the other. Myers became a finer artist not by seeking
" Art for art's sake," but by using his art for moral and scientific ends
at once. Shallow thinkers may at times call him " rhetorical," because
they do not reflect that rhetoric is after all the art of making other men
share one's faith. In this sense Myers was eminently "rhetorical";
he had to an extraordinary degree the gift of persuasiveness—a gift
which is probably even better displayed in his correspondence than in
his published work. His sympathetic and emotional nature went quick
and straight to an opponent's point of view ; his skill in language could
present his own immediate object even to the coldest adversary as
eminently rational and desirable.
But in his best work there is little that even an enemy can call
rhetorical. On the contrary, the most remarkable feature in it is,
to my mind, the eminently workmanlike style in which he could, when
occasion called for it, render a lucid statement of long and often
repellent points. Any one of his papers in our Proceedings will
abundantly show this capacity. If I instance that on Pseudo-possession
(in Vol. XV., pp. 384-415), it is not because of any special interest or
merit to be found in it, but because it is an average—an almost every
XLII.] F. W. H. Myers as a Man of letters. 35
day—specimen of his work, and (with the exception of his memoir
of Henry Sidgwick) the last published during his life. It is a dis
cussion of two French medical works, and opens with a studiously
unadorned statement of facts. The luminous arrangement will
hardly be appreciated by any who have not learnt by experience
how hard a task it is to set out clearly in short space essential
points picked out from a large mass of recorded observation. But
we have not gone far before Myers's humour begins to play round
the dull tale of hysteria. The " tragedy of the free breakfast table "
(p. 389), is followed by the scene between " the wily psychologist and
the common devil" (p. 391); and among the pregnant and trenchant
criticisms of the doctrine of metempsychosis our eyes can hardly fail
to twinkle as we hear how Victor Hugo " took possession," as his own
earlier avatars, " of most of the leading personages of antiquity whom
he could manage to string together in chronological sequence." But
the whole essay is a masterpiece in scientific treatment of intractable
materials. It contains, almost as an obiter dictum, Myers's last words
on telepathy (pp. 408-410), put with cogency to satisfy the most
exigent logician ; and it is only on the last page that the burning moral
conviction of which we have been half-conscious throughout is allowed
to show itself openly in the closing chord of hope—in the assurance
on which Myers was never tired of dwelling, that the human race is yet
in infancy ; that we are " the ancients of the world " ; and that all this
strange farrago of hysteria, telepathy, automatism, and genius points
forwards to the day when our successors "will look on our religions with
pity and our science with contempt, while they analyse with a smile
our rudimentary efforts at self-realisation, remarking 'how hard a
thing it was to found the race of man.'"
It is natural to compare Myers to Ruskin. Both devoted high gifts
of genius to high moral ends. Much of Modern Painters has like faults
with St. Paul, and Ruskin like Myers learnt with years the need of
self-suppression, though at the last he affected a simplicity which was
somewhat overdone. But in two points at least Myers was the finer
artist, if indeed the two points are not really one. Myers has the
finer gift of humour. Readers of his published Essays only would
hardly suspect how keen this was ; but it was never suppressed when
he wrote for our Proctfdings, or when he gave the S.P.R. or some other
congenial audience one of those wonderful addresses, delivered without
36 Dr. Walter Leaf. [PART XLII.]
note or hesitation, which made us feel that he could, had he chosen,
have taken as high a rank among orators as among writers.
And above all Myers was always preaching hope—hope for man
in the largest sense. There is in all he wrote not one touch of the
peevish dissatisfaction of the prophet in an unworthy age which mars
beyond redemption so much of Ruskin's best work. Myers was
throughout masculine, and his ever-growing faith in man's life beyond
the grave raised him higher and higher above the petty discourage
ments which to Buskin seemed to make all his preaching hopeless even
while it was being uttered. Myers worked with all his heart for men
in the sure and certain hope that his labours, however slow advance
might seem, would not in the end be in vain.
It is less possible to appreciate Myers than even Ruskin without
insisting on this indissoluble interfusion of literature and morals.
The essay on his best-beloved Virgil is perhaps that of all his utter
ances which gives us most of his literary self. And the very heart
of Virgil was to him in the famous speech of Anchises to Aeneas
in Elysium (Aen. vi. 724-755), where the poet " who meant, as
We know, to devote to philosophy the rest of his life after the
completion of the Aeneid," propounds "an answer to the riddle
of the universe in an unexpectedly definite form.'' This ultimate
subordination of form to substance, of art to thought, is the whole
story of Myers's literary work. His art gained all the more because
it was not pursued as a primary aim, and the obvious rewards of it
were little sought. Those only who followed the working of his
aspirations will adequately recognise his mastery, and see how for him
style was but the expression of his inmost soul. In his wonderful
fragments of Virgilian translation he reached his height. The poet
who was ever his truest ideal is transfused till the Roman and the
Englishman blend in one passion, human and divine, and the
triumphant song is taken up and proclaimed again after two thousand
years :
"To God again the enfranchised soul must tend,
He is her home, her Author is her end ;
No death is hers ; when earthly eyes grow dim
Starlike she soars and Godlike melts in Him."

MARCH, 1902.
ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT,
DR. OLIVER LODGE, F.R.S.
IN continuing to occupy the Chair for another year I am called upon
to address the Society, and I do so under some disadvantage as having
not very recently had an opportunity for personal investigation into
any important phenomenon about which the Society might be desirous
of hearing. Accordingly it appears that I must make some general
observations about certain aspects of our work, and must attempt a
review of some portions of the situation.
To this end I propose to say something on each of the following
topics, though I shall by no means attempt to treat any of them ex
haustively :—
(1) The current explanations of trance lucidity and clairvoyance.
(2) The strange physical phenomena sometimes accompanying
trance.
(3) The views concerning these ultra-normal human faculties that
most appeal to me.
First I will speak of trance lucidity and clairvoyance; whereby I
intend just now to signify the fact, the undoubted fact as it appears
to me, that under certain conditions the mouth can speak and the
hand can write concerning things wholly outside the normal ken of
the mind usually controlling them. There are many questions of
interest about this process : the muscles of the mouth and hand appear

to be stimulated, not from the brain centres dominated by the will, but
from some more automatic and less conscious region of the brain, the
part ordinarily supposed to be concerned in dreams and in hypnosis and
automatisms generally ; at any rate the normal customary mind of the
writer or speaker does not appear to be drawn upon. And yet there
appears to be an operating intelligence, with a character and knowledge
of its own. The questions of interest are, What is that operating
intelligence ? and how is the extra knowledge displayed by it attained t
The chief customary alternative answers to the second question are
two :—
(a) By telepathy from living people.
(6) By direct information imparted to it by the continued conscious
individual agency of deceased persons.
On each of these hypothetical explanations so much has been said,
for and against, that perhaps it is unnecessary to recapitulate the
arguments ; especially since in that (in every sense) considerable part
of the Proceedings which has been recently issued, Professor Hyslop
has dealt with the whole subject in an elaborate and careful manner;
and, for my own part, I wish to express to him my thanks for the
great care and labour he has bestowed upon this work, and for the
valuable contribution to Science which he has made. I know by
experience how troublesome it is, and how much time it consumes, to
comment with anything like fulness upon a long series of trance
utterances relating to domestic matters about which strangers are
naturally quite uninformed and uninterested, and how difficult it is to
make appear in the printed record any trace of the human and living
interest sometimes vividly felt in the communications themselves by
those to whom all the little references and personal traits have been
familiar from childhood. No doubt all such records must necessarily
appear very dull to strangers, just as a family conversation overheard
in a railway carriage, about " Harry " and " Uncle Tom " and " Lucy "
and the rest, becomes, if long continued, oppressively wearisome.
Patience, however, is one of the virtues which any one aspiring to be
a student has to learn. The bulk of Professor Hyslop's Report may
deter a good many people from even beginning to read it ; but I would
point out that a great deal of this bulk consists, not of the record itself,
but of comments on it, discussion of hypotheses concerning it, and a
record of ingenious experiments undertaken, with the help of students
and colleagues at Columbia University, for the purpose of elucidating
it ; and while the complete record is there for any future student to
examine in detail, it is possible for any one skilled in the process of

reading and judicious skipping to make himself acquainted with the
main features of Professor Hyslop's weighty and splendid piece of work
without reading the whole volume.
This, however, is a digression.
Returning to the subject of trance-lucidity generally, I wish to
emphasise my conviction that an explanation based on telepathy as
a vera causa can be pressed too far. Telepathy is the one ultra-normal
human faculty to the reality of which most of those who have
engaged in these researches are prepared to assent ; that is, to assent
to it as a bare fact, a summary of certain observed phenomena ; but
its laws are unknown and its scope and meaning are not yet apparent.
It is probably but one of a whole series of scientifically unrecorded
and unrecognised human faculties ; and it may turn out to be a mistake
to attempt to employ it for the purpose of explaining a great number
of other powers, which may be co-extensive or equipollent with itself;
though the attempt is a natural and proper one to make. A key must
be tried in all locks before we can be sure that it is not a master key ;
and if it open only one or two, it represents so much gained.
Telepathy itself, however, is in need of explanation. An idea or
thought in the mind of one person reverberates and dimly appears
in the mind of another. How does this occur? Is it a physical
process going on in some physical medium or ether connecting the
two brains ? Is it primarily a physiological function of the brain,
or is it primarily psychological ? If psychological only, what does
that mean ; Perhaps it may not be a direct immediate action
between the two minds at all ; perhaps there must be an intermediary,
—if not a physical medium, then a psychological medium,—or con
ceivably a third intelligence or mind operating on both agent and
percipient, or in communication with both.
Until we can answer these questions,—and for myself I doubt if
I have succeeded even in properly formulating them,— it is scarcely
possible to regard telepathy, even from the sitter, as a legitimate
explanation of much of the clairvoyance or lucidity noticed in trance
utterances. It may have to be assumed as the least strained explana
tion, but it cannot with certainty be definitely asserted to be the
correct one, even when it would easily cover the facts ; still less is it
permissible, except as the vaguest and most groping hypothesis, to press
it whenever convenient beyond the limits of experiment into an extra
polated region, and to suppose that the minds of entirely disconnected
and unconscious strangers at a distance are actually read : when it has
never been experimentally shown that they can be read at all.
40 Address by the President, [PART
Those strangers must be supposed to be less familiar with the
concerns of the person ostensibly represented as communicating through
an entranced medium than he would be himself: why should we
seek to go beyond the hypothesis of the agency of his in some way
persisting intelligence and postulate the unconscious agency of outside
or stranger persons ? The reasons for doing so are obvious and may
be cogent. It is easy to suppose that living people somewhere are
acquainted each with one or two of the facts related by the
clairvoyante : and these people exist ; whereas we are not by any
means so sure of the continued existence of the deceased person who
is the ostensible communicator. In fact, that is just the thing we
should like to be able to prove ; i.e., we should like to ascertain the
actual truth concerning it, in a scientific way. Hence, again, I
would plead that those of our members who are convinced of con
tinued existence, continued accessible existence, must try to be patient
with those of us who are not : impatience of any kind is out of place
in this difficult quest, to which in all ages some part of humanity has
devoted itself with only personal and not universal satisfaction.
One hypothesis concerning the agency of unembodied spirits is that
they themselves temporarily occupy and animate some portion of the
body of the medium, and thereby control a sufficient part of the
physiological mechanism to convey the message they desire. The
impression which such a hypothesis as this makes upon us depends
upon the view that we take of our own normal powers : it derives
any prima facie reasonableness which it may possess from the theory
that we ourselves are mental entities, to which the names soul, spirit,
etc., have been popularly applied, who may be said to form or accrete,
to inhabit and to control a certain assemblage of terrestrial atoms,
which we call our bodies ; by means of which we, as psychological
agents, can manage to convey more or less intelligible messages to
other similarly clothed or incarnate intelligences : employing for that
purpose such physical processes as the production of aerial vibrations,
or the record left by ink traces upon paper.
Given that we are such meutal entities or psychological intelligences,
with the power of accreting and shaping matter by the act of feeding,
we must note in passing the important fact that the manufacture of
our bodies, just spoken of, is a feat accomplished by life without mind,
or at least with only sub-conscious mind : it is wholly beyond the power
of our conscious mind to perform. Feed a child, and in due course
unconsciously he becomes a man,—a process beyond our control or
understanding and wholly transcending our utmost executive skill.
XLIII.] Dr. Oliver Lodge. 41
Xote further that it is the same unconscious life, or part of the
body, or whatever is the proper term, which manages nearly all
the ordinary vital processes, and disposes of our food or gives us
indigestion as it sees fit. This may seem a frivolous interlude, but
it is important in connection with what follows. It is perhaps
obviously important in connection with the whole business of the
inter-action between mind and matter.
The hypothesis which seeks to explain the control of a medium's
body in trance by the agency of discarnate spirits, presumes that
an elaborate machine like our bodies is capable of being occasionally
used, not only by the mind or intelligence which manufactured it,
so to speak, but temporarily and with difficulty by other minds or
intelligences permitted to make use of it.
There are many difficulties here, and one of them is the assumption
that such other intelligences exist. But that I confess is to me not
a very improbable assumption ; for knowing what we already certainly
know of the material universe, of its immense scope, and the number
of habitable worlds it contains (I do not say inhabited, for that the
evidence does not yet reveal, but habitable worlds), realising also
the absurdity of the idea that our few senses have instructed us
concerning all the possibilities of existence which can be associated
in onr minds with the generalised idea of " habitable " : perceiving
also the immense variety of life which luxuriates everywhere on this
planet wherever the conditions permit : I find it impossible to deny
the probability that there may be in space an immense range of life
and intelligence of which at present we know nothing.
Indeed, we ourselves are here on this planet and in this body for
only a few score revolutions of the earth round the sun : a thousand
months exceeds what we call the " lifetime " of most of us. Where
or what we were before, and where or what we shall be after, are
questions—intimately and necessarily connected with each other as
I believe, and as Plato taught, or allowed himself to appear to teach—
which as yet remain unanswered and as some think unanswerable.
But granting the possibility of a far greater and more widespread
prevalence of life or mind than we have been accustomed to
eontemplate—a prevalence as extensive, perhaps, as that of matter-—
what is the probability that the different classes of life and mind
interfere or inter-operate with each other ? There is no a priori
probability either way : it is purely a question for experience and
observation.
By observation we learn that as a general rule the visible and
D2
42 Address by the President, [PART
sensible inhabitants of this world are to all appearance left to pursue
their own policy undisturbed except by mutual collision, conflict or
co-operation. How much of this isolation is apparent, and how much
of it is real, I will not now inquire. I believe it would be admitted
by philosophers that the appearance of isolation and independence
would be likely to present itself, even in a world where the reality
was guidance and control ; and certainly there have at all times
been persons, called religious persons, who have felt more or less
conscious of directing aid.
So it is with the material worlds :—they sail placidly along in
the immensities of space, unimpeded and unhampered ; and pluming
themselves, perhaps, many of them—those whose physical atmosphere
happens to be extra dense, or whose vision is otherwise limited—on
the idea of complete, possibly they call it splendid, isolation. But
we who see further, through our clearer air,—we, the heirs of
Aristarchus, Copernicus, and Galileo, who realise the orbs of space,—
know that this apparent freedom is illusory : that all their motions
are controlled by a force of which they are unconscious : and that
even the outward appearance of isolation, or immunity from external
disturbance, is liable to be suddenly and violently terminated ; for
we know that in the depths of space, every now and then, a
substantial encounter with some other similar body occurs—a collision,
a catastrophe, and the blaze of what we call a new star : a phenomenon
which by persons more closely concerned—persons in the immediate
neighbourhood, if such there be—would rather be styled the destruction
of an old one.i
In the psychological world have we ever experienced any such
ultra-normal phenomenon, any interference from without of our
normal and placid condition ; is there any record of an inrush of
intelligence or of moral character beyond the standard of humanity,
any avenue to information not normally accessible, any revolution
in our ideas of God and of humanity and of the meaning of existence ?
Have we ever welcomed or maltreated a prophet or a seer of the
first magnitude 1 Or, on a lower level, have we ever had experience,
in our family life, of any strange occurrence, apparently! hallucinatory
'I am well aware that collision between solid habitable globes must be an
extremely rare occurrence, and that collisions between widespread or nebulous
masses must be much commoner. But the meaning of what I am saying does
not depend on the habitability of the colliding masses, nor does it depend on the
relative frequency of collisions ; my point is to emphasise the rarity, but at the
same time the possibility, of the occurrence.
XLIII.] Dr. Oliver Lodge. 43
but yet significant, any vision or voice or communication from friends
beyond the normal range, or, it may be, from friends beyond the
veil? Or, to go lower down still, have we ever witnessed any
movement of material objects which by known causes or by normal
inhabitants of this planet have not been moved ?
It is a question of evidence whether such things have occurred ;
and opinions differ. For myself, I think they have. Part of the
extra difficulty of accepting evidence for any unusual phenomena
is the a priori notion that such occurrences are contrary to Natural
Law, and are therefore impossible. We cannot, however, clearly
tell that they are contrary to natural law ; all we can safely say is
that they are contrary to natural custom ; or, safer still, that they
are contrary or supplementary to our own usual experience. That
last statement is safe enough ; but between that and the adjective
"impossible," or the equivalent phrase "contrary to the order of
Nature," there is a vast and unfillable gap.
Whence, then, arises the antagonism—the inveterate and, let us
hope, expiring antagonism—between orthodox science and the evidence
that humanity has at different times adduced, the evidence which
our Society has conscientiously worked at, that such occasional
irruptions do occur? It arises, I think, because Science has a horror
of the unintelligible : it can make nothing of a capricious and dis
orderly agent, and it prefers to ignore the existence of any such.
It is accustomed to simplify its problems by the method of abstraction
—that powerful practical method of ignoring or eliminating any
causes which are too embarrassing, too complex or too trivial, to be
taken into account. And by a long course of successful ignoration
it may have acquired a habit of thinking that it can actually exclude,
instead of only abstract, these disturbing causes. That, however, is
beyond its power. Abstraction is a most useful process, but it can
only exclude from consideration ; it cannot really exclude from the
universei anything too complex or too apparently disorderly. Of
course there is no real hesitation on the part of any one to admit
such a statement as that; but nevertheless a certain amount of
exclusion—exclusion from its own experimental area—science has
found it possible to exert : and it has exercised this exclusion. If
disturbances were frequent, trustworthy science would be almost
impossible ; life in the laboratory would be like that depicted by the
author of Prehistoric Peeps, where long-necked reptiles assist at every
entertainment.
'James Ward, Naturalism and Aynosticifim, vol. i , p. 77-
44 Address by the President, [PART
So also a little mischief or malice might cause trouble in any
scientific laboratory. Introduce a spider or other live animal into
the balance or other delicate apparatus of the physicist, and he will
for a time be thrown into confusion. Something capricious and
disorderly has entered, and spoils everything. This is just the sort
of annoyance which a scientific man would feel if suddenly introduced
into a traditional seance in full activity. It would, however, be open
to a first-rate experimentalist, even if a spider were a perfectly new
experience to him, to catch it and tame it and get it to spin webs
for his further instrumental convenience ; but usually it would be
ejected as too confusing, and its study would be left to the biologists.
If biologists did not exist, if the live beast were the first ever
experienced, and if, subsequent to the confusion, it escaped, it is
difficult to see how a narrative of the experience could be received
by any scientific society to which it was recounted, except with
incredulity, more or less polite.
So, I conceive, could a human being, looking down on an ant
world, inflict catastrophe and work miracles of a discomposing
character. I suppose that the ordinary ant in populous countries
must already have been liable to such irruptions and disturbance of
its economy in past history, and may be thought to have accumulated
and handed down some legends of such occurrences ; but to ants
in unexplored countries, the achievements of some shipwrecked mariner
might come as a novel and incredible experience. And it may be
noted that the performances of humanity could be beyond the powers
of the ant community, not only in magnitude, but in kind. For
instance, human beings might administer chemicals, or electric shocks,
or sunlight concentrated by a lens.
Now, by far the greater number of the physical phenomena which
are asserted to take place in the presence of a medium involve
nothing in themselves extraordinary : the production of scent, for
instance, the introduction of flowers and other objects, movements
of furniture, the impress on photographic plates, are all of a nature
that can easily be managed by normal means, given time and oppor
tunity ; and the only thing requiring explanation is how they are
managed under the given conditions, more or less stringently devised
to prevent their normal occurrence. This is a familiar old battle
ground, at which we glance and pass on.
But there is a residue of traditional physical phenomena which
involve an effect beyond ordinary human power to accomplish. For
instance, the asserted resistance of the human skin and nerves to fire,
XLIII.] Dr. Oliver Lodge. 45
usually though not always when under religious emotion or in some
trance state ; or the extraction of a solid object from a permanently
closed box ; or, what is much more commonly asserted than the other
two, the materialisation or appearance of temporary human forms.
I confess that I myself have never seen any of these things achieved
under satisfactory conditions, but the evidence of Sir William Crookes
and others for certain of them is very detailed ; and it is almost as
difficult to resist the testimony as it is to accept the things testified.
Moreover, some in this audience must imagine themselves perfectly
familiar with all these occurrences.
Let us therefore see whether, in the light of our present knowledge
of Physics, they are wholly impossible and absurd, so that no testimony
could produce any effect on our incredulity ; or whether we may
complacently inquire into the evidence, and be prepared to investigate
any given case of their occurrence; with care and due scepticism
undoubtedly, but not with fixed and impervious minds.
One of the three instances quoted seems in some respects the
simplest and most definite, inasmuch as it keeps off the less familiar
ground of physiology and biology and touches only on physics. I
mean the phenomenon commonly spoken of as the "passage of
matter through matter,"—the passage or leakage of one inorganic solid
through another, without damage or violence. Asserted instances of
this are such as the tying or untying of knots on an endless string, the
extraction of a billiard ball from a permanently closed shell, and
the linkage together of two closed rings. I have never seen a trust
worthy instance of any of these occurrences. I know of rings being
put over things apparently too large—a ring on the stem of a wineglass,
for instance, or on the leg of a round table, or on a man's wrist,i—but
I have never seen a permanent and undeniable instance of what may
be termed a physical miracle ; and I am not aware that there is such a
thing on view in the world as, for instance, the linkage of unjoined
rings of different kinds of wood : though perhaps the skill of the
botanist or tree fancier might manage to accomplish this by constrained
growth under favourable conditions. I assume, however, that any
natural mode of doing it could be detected by proper botanical
examination of the result.
'The iron ring on Husk's wrist being believed by Dr. George Wyld to be
miraculously small, i.e. too small to have ever gone over the hand ; see Pro-
ctedingt S.P.R., vol. III., p. 460, for an account of an investigation of this
phenomenon by Sir William Crookes, Mr. Victor Horsley, and others, who con
cluded that the ring might have come into the position in which they found it by
known natural forces.
46 Address by the President, [PART
A couple of rings of unjoined leather, cut out of a single skin, have
been shown linked together ; but this linkage can be managed by
taking advantage of the thickness of the skin and by judicious cutting.
An assemblage of wineglass and egg-cup stems, packed through a
hole in a piece of wood, has been produced in Berlin, and has
been kindly lent for our inspection ; but though this is asserted to
have been produced under supernormal conditions, it is certainly
only of the nature of a moderately ingenious mechanical contrivance
involving skilled and deceptive construction. A similar object, con
sisting of a wooden ring on the neck of a glass vase, recently con
structed (quite normally) in Sir William Crookes's laboratory, I am
also permitted to exhibit.
But concerning the abnormal " passage of matter through matter," I
am not aware that Sir William Crookes has ever testified to any
instance of it ; the only scientific evidence that I am acquainted with
was that given by Professor Zollner, which, though extremely curious
and puzzling and detailed, does not leave a feeling of conviction on the
unprejudiced mind.
Accordingly, the simplest thing for me, or any other scientific man
at the present day, is to treat the case of matter through matter as
not only unproven but as impossible, and to decline to consider it.
Nevertheless, so many extraordinary things have happened that I
would not feel too certain that we may not some day have to provide
a niche for something of this kind. If so, one hardly likes to suggest
that the recently-discovered probably complex structure of the material
atom, with interspaces very large in proportion to the aggregate bulk
of its actual constituents, may have to be appealed to, in order to
explain the hypothetical interpenetration of two solids. At present,
however, the difficulties of any such hypothesis are enormous, and I
confess myself an entire sceptic as to the occurrence of any such
phenomenon, and should require extremely cogent evidence to
convince me.
But it may be said, Do I find movements of untouched objects, or
do I find materialisations, any easier of belief? Yes, I do. I am
disposed to maintain that I have myself witnessed, in a dim light,
occasional abnormal instances of these things ; and I am certainly
prepared to entertain a consideration of them.
Suppose an untouched object comes sailing or hurtling through the
air, or suppose an object is raised or floated from the ground, how are
we to regard it ? This is just what a live animal could do, and so the
first natural hypothesis is that some live thing is doing it; (a) the
XLIII.] Dr. Oliver Lodge. 47
medium himself, acting by trick or concealed mechanism ; (6) a
confederate,—an unconscious confederate perhaps among the sitters :
(<) an unknown and invisible live entity other than the people present.
If in any such action the ordinary laws of nature were superseded,
if the weight of a piece of matter could be shown to have disappeared,
or if fresh energy were introduced beyond the recognised categories
of energy, then there would be additional difficulties ; but hitherto
there has been no attempt to establish either of these things. Indeed
it must be admitted that insufficient attention is usually paid to this
aspect of ordinary commonplace abnormal physical phenomena. If a
heavy body is raised under good conditions, we should always try to
ascertain (I do not say that it is easy to ascertain) where its weight
has gone to ; that is to say, what supports it, what ultimately supports
it. For instance, if experiments were conducted in a suspended room,
would the weight of that room, as ascertained by an outside balance,
remain unaltered when a table or person was levitated inside it 1
or could the agencies operating inside affect bodies outside ?—questions
these which appear capable of answer, with sufficient trouble, in an
organised psychical laboratory : such a laboratory as does not, I
suppose, yet exist, but which might exist, and which will exist in the
future, if the physical aspect of experimental psychology is ever to
become recognised as a branch of orthodox physics.
Or take materialisations. I do not pretend to understand them,
but, as I have hinted in an earlier part of this Address, if ever genuine
and objective, they may after all represent only a singular and
surprising modification of a known power of life. Somewhat as a
mollusc, or a crustacean, or a snail can extract material from the water
or from its surroundings wherewith to make a shell, or—a closer
analogy—just as an animal can assimilate the material of its food
and convert it into muscle, or hair, or skin, or bone, or feathers—a
process of the utmost marvel, but nevertheless an everyday occurrence,
—so I could conceive it possible, if the evidence were good enough,
that some other intelligence or living entity, not ordinarily manifest
to our senses, though possibly already in constant touch with our
physical universe by reason of possessing what may be called an
etherial body, could for a time utilise the terrestrial particles which
come in ita way, and make for itself a sort of material structure
capable of appealing to our ordinary senses. The thing is extremely
unlikely, but it is not altogether unimaginable. Nor is it physically
impossible that some of these temporary semi-material accretions might
be inadequate to appeal to our eyes and yet be of a kind able to
48 Address by the President, [PART
impress a photographic plate ; but here I confess that the evidence,
to my mind, wholly breaks down, and I have never yet seen a
satisfying instance of what is termed a spirit photograph ; nor is it
easy to imagine the kind of record, apart from testimony, which in
such a case would be convincing ; unless -such photographs could be
produced at will.
The evidence for photographs of invisible people which we some
times hear adduced as adequate is surprisingly feeble. For instance,
in a recent anonymous and weak book, said to be written by a
member of this Society, two such photographs are reproduced which
are said to have been obtained under what are considered crucial
conditions ; but the narrative itself at once suggests a simple trick
on the part of the photographer, viz., the provision of backgrounds
for sitters with vague human forms all ready depicted on them in
sulphate of quinine.
The ingenious and able impositions of a conjurer are causes
verissimce, and full allowance must be made for them. Some of the
physical phenomena which I have adduced as among those pro
claimed to have occurred, such as apporis, sceut, movement of objects,
passage of matter through matter,i bear a perilous resemblance to
conjuring tricks, of a kind fairly well known ; which tricks if well
done can be very deceptive. Hence extreme caution is necessary,
and full control must be allowed to the observers,—a thing which
conjurers never really allow : I have never seen a silent and genuinely-
controlled conjurer : and in so far as mediums find it necessary to
insist on their own conditions, so far they must be content to be
treated as conjurers. Honest and good people are often the most
readily deceived, especially by protestations and by injured innocence :
so certain Members and Associates of this Society must be good enough
to pardon the rest of us for being, as they think, stupidly and absurdly
sceptical about the reality of many phenomena in which they themselves
strongly believe. "Facts are chiels that winna ding," says Robert
Burns. So is belief. One cannot coerce belief. And it is difficult
sometimes to adduce satisfying reasons for either the faith or the
incredulity that is in us on any particular topic.
One is frequently asked by casual and irresponsible persons : Do
you believe in so and so ? usually : Do you believe in ghosts ?—a question
which ordinarily has no meaning in the mind of the asker, and to
A technical phrase which I do not justify and do not trouble to improve upon

XLIII.] Dr. Oliver Lodge. 49
which a categorical reply, either yes or no, would convey no real
information. The best answer to such a question is that belief is not
our business, but that investigation is ; and if any answer beyond that
is to be given to a stranger, it must take the form of a question
asking for a definition of the terms used,—a stage beyond which
the casual inquirer can rarely go.
But suppose he can, and is not a flippant inquirer, with an eye
to ridicule, or a comic article in the Press. This Society, for
instance, is not in the position of a casual and irresponsible inquirer;
almost every grade of opinion, and probably almost every grade of
intelligence, exists among its members ; indeed it would be only
wholesome in the present state of our knowledge if each one of us
held a different shade of opinion. Moreover, some of our members
must have devoted the greater part of a lifetime to the subject, and
must be far more experienced than myself; but still if any one
cares to hear what sort of conviction has been borne in upon my
own mind, as a scientific man, by some 20 years' familiarity with
those questions which concern us, I am very willing to reply as
frankly as I can.
First, then, I am, for all personal purposes, convinced of the
persistence of human existence beyond bodily death ; and though
I am unable to justify that belief in a full and complete manner,
yet it is a belief which has been produced by scientific evidence;
that is, it is based upon facts and experience, though I might find it
impossible to explain categorically how the facts have produced that
conviction. Suffice it to say for the present that it is not in a simple
and obvious way, nor one that can be grasped in an hour or two,
except by those who have seriously studied the subject, and are con
sequently equally entitled to an opinion of their own.
For if asked : Do I associate physical movements and other physical
phenomena with the continued existence of deceased persons 1 I
must answer I do not. The phenomena always occur in the presence
of the living, and the natural supposition at first is that the living
in some unknown way produced them ; that, in so far as they are
not tricks, they represent an unexpected and unrecognised extension of
human muscular faculty ;—a faculty which, by the way, though we are
well accustomed to it, is itself, in its quite normal manifestations,
a most noteworthy phenomenon, and philosophically considered of
extreme significance; though it would take too long to bring out
the full meaning of what I here suggest. Suffice it to say that by
the action of live things the ordinary processes of the degradation
50 Address by the President, [PART
or dissipation of energy can be diverted or suspended or reversed 1 ;
weights can be raised which inorganically would have fallen ; rivers
can be deflected, and the face of the earth changed ; and, most
surprising of all, a conclave of persons can sit and decide, or to all
appearance decide, whether a certain thing shall happen or shall not.
If pressed, I must confess that I do not see how the hypothesis of
the continued existence of human personalities, so long as they are
disconnected with bodies and muscles, is any real help in explaining
ultra-normal physical movements ; except that since .the movements
show traces of what we ordinarily speak of as will and intelligence,
they do suggest the agency nfjivn tihingi jif snmn kind.

Eliminating physical pheVqmefta ther^pje^w the present, suppose
that I am asked further : Do yoft^wtsitterthat trance-utterances are
ever due to the agency of departed persons ? I am bound to say that,
as regards the content or intelligence of the message, I have known
cases which do very strongly indicate some form of access to a
persistent portion of the departed personality; and occasionally, though
rarely, the actual psychical agency of a deceased person is indicated.
But if by agency my hearers understand me to mean in all cases
conscious agency, direct communication with full consciousness of what
is going on, they must allow me to explain that of that in most cases
I am extremely doubtful. It seems to me much more often like a
dream intelligence or a sub-conscious part of the persistent mind that
we have access to, not a conscious part. It appears to me still a true
kind of telepathy ; and telepathy from, as well as to, a sub-conscious
stratum. This use of the term is an extension of its ordinary one,
but it is an extension which appears to be required. (See Mrs.
Sidgwick, Proceedings S.P.R., vol. XV., pp. 17, 18.)
The medium when awakened does not usually remember, is not
really conscious of, the communication which has been spoken or
written : not until he or she returns to the state of trance. Nor
should I expect the ostensible communicator, so long as he is anything
like ourselves, to remember or to be properly conscious of what has
been, as it were, drawn from his memory, until he too returns once
more into the same dream-like or semi-conscious or sub-conscious con
dition. There may be all grades of recollection, however; analogous
'Witness "Maxwell's demons" in theory, and nitrifying bacteria in what is
now accepted as botanictil fact.
XLIII.] Dr. Oliver Lodge. 51
to the various grades of reminiscence of ordinary dreams, as and
after we wake.
Moreover, it appears as if the portion of the deceased person which,
on this hypothesis, is once more in a manner materialised for us,
and with which we hold communication, is sometimes but a very
fragmentary portioni; so fragmentary that if at some other or at the
same time the same ostensible individual is operating through another
medium elsewhere, the two portions are, I believe, sometimes unaware
of what each is, so to speak, saying, and are liable to deny each other's
genuineness. Occasionally, however, in my experience, there has been
an indication that the bare fact of simultaneous communication through
two mediums is known or felt ; and I urge that more experiments and
observations are needed in this direction, which will, I hope, prove
an extremely helpful line of research if only it can be worked. The
difficulties are obviously great and the opportunities few. Anyhow
it will be agreed that this double communication from ostensibly one
intelligence, with the contents of each message unknown to the other
communicator, is an interesting and instructive phenomenon, if it is
real, and one that fits in excellently with Mr. Myers' luminous hypo
thesis of the subliminal self.
For, to tell truth, I do not myself hold that the whole of any one
of us is incarnated in these terrestrial bodies ; certainly not in child
hood ; more, but perhaps not so very much more, in adult life. What
is manifested in this body is, I venture to think likely, only a portion,
an individualised, a definite portion, of a much larger whole. What
the rest of me may be doing, for these few years while I am here,
I do not know : perhaps it is asleep ; but probably it 'is not so entirely
asleep with men of genius ; nor, perhaps, is it all completely inactive
with the people called "mediums."
(Imagination in science is permissible, provided one's imaginings

greater part of us—is in touch with another order of existence, and
that it is occasionally able to communicate, or somehow, perhaps
unconsciously, transmit to the fragment in the body, something of the
information accessible to it. This guess, if permissible, would contain
a clue to a possible explanation of clairvoyance. We should then be
like icebergs floating in an ocean, with only a fraction exposed to aun
and air and observation : the rest—by far the greater bulk—sub
merged in a connecting medium, submerged and occasionally in sub
liminal or sub-aqueous contact with others, while still the peaks,
the visible bergs, are far separate.i
" We feel that we are greater than we know."
Or, reversing the metaphor, we might liken our present state to
that of the hulls of ships submerged in a dim ocean among many
strange beasts, propelled in a blind manner through space ; proud,
perhaps, of accumulating many barnacles as decoration ; only
recognising our destination by bumping against the dock wall ;
and with no cognisance of the deck and the cabins, the spars and
the sails, no thought of the sextant and the compass and the captain,
no perception of the look-out on the mast, of the distant horizon,
no vision of objects far ahead, dangers to be avoided, destinations
to be reached, other ships to be spoken with by other means than
bodily contact,—a region of sunshine and cloud, of space, of perception,
and of intelligence, utterly inaccessible to the parts below the
waterline.
Incidentally, if one were permitted rather rashly to speculate, it
might be suggested that most of the disputes about re-incarnation
could be hypothetically reconciled by this hypothesis of the subliminal
self. Not the same individual portion need perhaps be incarnated
again, but another phase of the whole ; and so gradually each aspect
might acquire the experience, the submerged experience, so to speak,
and the practical training, obtainable by incarnate life on one of
the vagrant lumps of matter known as habitable planets.
So also are the difficulties of birth and recent childhood, recent
nonentity, minimised by the subliminal self hypothesis. The suggestion
is an obvious one that as a body becomes gradually ready and the
child grows, so more and more of the total personality leaks, as it
were, into it, until we get the adult individual as we know him :
sometimes more of the whole—what we call a great man : sometimes
i Perhaps it may not be superfluous to say that an iceberg floats with only about

less—a deficient man. And death is the rejoining and re-uniting
of the temporarily almost dissevered and curiously educated fraction
to the whole. Shall such a mental entity be only capable of complete
and thorough incarnation ? Shall it never in some dreamy and
semi-conscious or unconscious state influence another body, or take
any physical part in the scenes in which for a time it was so interested f
The opportunities appear to be scarce, and the phenomenon is rare ;
but who is to say that it is non-existent; and who shall say that
the fact that the communications are vague, hesitating, uncertain,
sometimes mistaken, and never complete,—though no doubt there
are several grades towards completeness,—goes to prove that the
residue is not genuine? It is occasionally almost like trying to hold
a conversation with some one in his sleep : it is hard to judge of a
personality by that sort of test. Indeed, there are all grades of
brilliancy even in our own waking complete selves : not always are
we at our best; and odd conceptions might be formed of our intelli
gence if a stranger judged us by our remarks on the weather or the
crops. I am told that Browning spoke in quite a commonplace
manner concerning the weather.
How often have we not found that the utterances of some eminent
person, even in his full bodily manifestation, do not come up to-
onr idea of him : an idea perhaps based on an acquaintance with a
record of his more fully developed personality in moments of
inspiration. There is a tale concerning Tennyson which I recently
heard ; it may not be true, but it is quite possible. A lady, a
worshipper of Tennyson, and long desirous of seeing him, was once
to her great joy invited to a dinner at which he sat opposite to her,
and she listened open-eared for his conversation. He spoke very
little, however, being apparently in an uninspired mood, not to say a
grumpy humour; and the only phrase she distinctly caught was,
"I like my mutton in chunks." That lady might easily have gone
iway convinced that she had been the victim of a fraud, and that
some unpoetic person had been palmed off on her as " the bard," after
the manner of the dinner party in The Golden Butterfly.
The fact that a "control" who frequently sends messages, brings
with him each time only the memory of previous messages through
the same medium, and is unaware of his other supposed manifesta
tions through other mediums, is very suggestive of what we know
concerning secondary and multiple personalities. The complete or
complex personality itself may perhaps know all about them all ;
but with this complete personality we seem unable to get into com
54 Address by the President, [PART
munication ; we can so far only reach the fragments, and through
different mediums different fragments, as if—speaking of it as a kind
of incarnation,—as if the temporary incarnation were affected or regu
lated by the kind of body occupied, and could not manifest in identical
fashion when constrained by the limitations of different instruments
just as an executive musician would naturally appeal to different
emotions if given, alternately, a violin, a cornet, a flute, and a concer
tina. We can hardly expect, on any view, to reach more than what
we have supposed to be the fraction which had been manifested here
in the flesh during earth life, but it appears as if we could not
reach so much as that—only a fragment of that. The specially
adapted and educated body and brain which it was wont to use is
no longer available,—the organ is broken, and the organist is
asked to manifest his identity on the harmonium of a country
church.
But neither telepathy nor yet the agency of deceased persons is
able to explain the asserted power of true clairvoyance properly
so-called : the perception of things unknown to every mind of a human
order 1 ; nor prediction of a kind other than inference.2 These are
great subjects, and I have something to say about them too, though
whether it is worth saying at the present time is very doubtful,
for I am not by any means convinced that either of these things
ever occurs. I will only say, therefore, in general, that the vague
hypothesis of a world-soul, or an immanent Mind, of which even
the totality of ourselves are only microscopic fragments, as our ordi
narily known selves have been supposed to be more substantial
fragments of our entire selves—a Mind to which space and time are
not the barriers and limitations which they appear to us—a Mind
to which the past, present, and future are not indeed all one, but
yet in a manner perceivable at will as a simultaneity as well as a
sequence, and in which no transit or travel is necessary to pass from
•one place to another,—I must say that a vague hypothesis of this
kind—a notion familiar to all philosophers—is often forced across
i For instance, the reading of numbers or letters grasped at random and thrown
into a bag ; or of a piece of newspaper torn out anywhere and sealed up without
having been looked at, and the residue promptly burnt ; if such a thing ever
occurs.
2 If such a thing is conceivable aa real prevision not deducible from a wide
.knowledge or survey of contemporaneous events ; for instance, the winner of a
neck-and-neck race, or the exact date of some optional and as yet undecided
event. But these are not good instances, for it must be assumed posriblc that
.the predicting agency might act so as to bring about fulfilment.

my vision as I think over the problems of this great and wonderful
universe.
To suppose that we know it all : to suppose that we have grasped
its main outlines, that we realise pretty completely not only what
is in it, but the still more stupendous problem of what is not and
cannot be in it—is a presumptuous exercise of limited intelligence,
only possible to a certain very practical and useful order of brain,
which has good solid work of a commonplace kind to do in the world,
and has been restricted in its outlook, let us say by Providence, in
order that it may do that one thing and do it well. Some of these
gnostic persons have been men of science, others have been men of
letters, some of them again politicians and men of business : some
few of them have called themselves philosophers,i but the world has
not thought them its greatest philosophers. The instinct of the world
in the long run, though only in the long run, is to be trusted ; and
the great men whom it has picked out as philosophers of the very
first magnitude—the philosopher Plato, of the older time, and the
philosopher Kant, of the more modern era— did not so limit their
conception of the possible ; nor have the greatest poets, those whom
humanity has canonised among its greatest poets—Virgil, let us say,
and Wordsworth and Tennyson—neither have they looked with dim
beclouded eyes on the present of the universe, or on the past and
the future of man.
Hear Tennyson on the origin of life and the antecedents of human
existence :—
Out of the deep, my child, out of the deep,
From that true world within the world we see,
Whereof our world is but the bounding shore.
i One cannot but sympathise to some extent with those philosophers who urge
that the progress of humanity has been achieved by attention to a development
of onr full consciousness, and that reversion to the subconscious or to dream
states is .-. step back. It must be noted, however, that the adjective "subliminal,"
as we understand it, is not suggestive of subordinate or subsidiary, but is far
more nearly related to "sublime": a statement which, considered objectively,
the philosophers in question would probably disallow. If they mean that for the
active and practical concerns of life consciousness must be our guide and our
adviser, I ain with them ; but if they mean (as I am sure they do not, when
pressed) that inspiration ia attained through consciousness, or that it is unlawful
and unfruitful to investigate the subconscious, where (I suggest) lie the roots of
the connection between mind and matter ; then I must join issue with them.
So might an iceberg, glorying in its crisp solidity and sparkling pinnacles, resent
attention paid to its submerged subliminal supporting region, or to the saline
liquid out of which it arose, and into which in due course it will some day return.

Hear him also on the present, and on the possibilities of inter
communion :—
The Ghost in Man, the Ghost that once was Man,
But cannot wholly free itself from Man,
Are calling to each other thro' a dawn
Stranger than earth has ever seen ; the veil

matter and mind :—
And we, the poor earth's dying race, and yet
No phantoms, watching from a phantom shore
Await the last and largest sense to make
The phantom walls of this illusion fade,
And show us that the world is wholly fair.
A quotation from Virgil, as translated by Mr. Myers, may be per
mitted even to one who has no claim to be a scholar. It is from the
speech of Anchises, in Book VI. of the JEneid, in reply to ^neas's
question whether the departed ever wish to return to the flesh ; and
Anchises, while maintaining that the flesh was a burden well cast off,
takes occasion to assert the essential unity of life and of mind through
out the universe :—
One Life through all the immense creation runs,
One Spirit is the moon's, the sea's, the sun's ;
All forms in the air that fly, on the earth that creep,
And the unknown nameless monsters of the deep—
Each breathing thing obeys one Mind's control,
And in all substance is a single Soul.
And, lastly, let us hear Wordsworth in that immortal Ode which
hymns the Platonic doctrine of life and an ever-present though seldom
realised connecting link between the diverse orders of existence :—
Hence in a season of calm weather
Though inland far we be,
Our Souls have sight of that immortal sea
Which brought us hither,
Can in a moment travel thither,
And see the Children sport upon the shore,
And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.
Meanwhile, what have we to do ? To inquire, to criticise, to dis
cover, but also to live,—to live this life here and now : aided thereto,
it may be, by a laboriously acquired certainty that it is only an

interlude in a more splendid drama. With some people, belief has
preceded and frustrated inquiry : others there are with whom investi
gation has resulted in belief: and yet again others to whom belief
continues unattainable in spite of conscientious effort and research.
Those who feel assured of a future existence may be thankful ; but
those who cannot feel so assured, with them also it is well, if they
apply their energies to service on this earthly plane, and reap the
wholesome and natural joys accessible to us in our present state.
Thanks to the human heart by which we live,
Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears,
To ine the meanest flower that blows can give

INTRODUCTION TO THE REPORTS OF SITTINGS WITH
MRS. THOMPSON.
BY DR. OLIVER LODGE, F.R.S.
FROM time to time an oval account has been given at meetings of the
Society by various members of their experiences with the lady living
at Hampstead, Mrs. Thompson, who has been good enough to allow a
few personally introduced friends to sit with her for the purpose of
observing and recording the phenomena of so-called mediumship which
developed themselves in connection with her ; but so far no publication
in the Proceedings of any of these records has been made.
This delay is in accordance with the usual practice of the Society in
dealing with the most important cases which come under its investiga
tion, opportunity being thus afforded for fuller light, in whatever
direction, to manifest itself. Mrs. Piper was under investigation for
several years before any report of her powers was published ; and
though her case was different, being that of a paid medium, it is
obvious that the same kind of caution should be exercised, and similar
opportunity for growing experience should, if possible, be afforded, in
any case which appears to be of the first evidential rank.
The records of sittings with Mrs. Thompson now published constitute
only a small proportion of the whole, but they represent some of those
of which the notes were most carefully and exactly made ; and they
give a fair idea or sample of the nature of the phenomenon—both at its
best and at its worst,—though indeed some private episodes in un-
reported sittings are held, by those with personal knowledge of
them, to be far superior to any here recorded.
The delay in this case has been useful since it has afforded oppor
tunity for Dr. Hodgson to have six sittings with Mrs. Thompson.
These appear to have been of the kind above denominated "worst,"
and his report is decidedly unfavourable ; indeed, he is strongly of
opinion that there was nothing of any value in them at all, and that
they suggest that in other cases also knowledge believed to have been
62 Dr. Oliver Lodge. [PART
of supernormal origin might be traced to normal sources of information
if the sitters had been equally competent. This being so, it is im
portant to have the fact recorded in our first publication ; and it has
been the wish of Mrs. Thompson herself that everything, whether
favourable or unfavourable, should be impartially published. Refer
ence to her letter in the Journal for November, 1901, will show the
admirable position which she takes up in such matters ; her object has
been to help in our quest, to this end she has given up much time and
taken much trouble ; and anything in the nature of suppression, either
of suspicious circumstances or of hostile criticism, would be resented by
her, just as it would be contrary to the whole spirit and traditions of
the Society.
In these phenomena the first question is, whether the information
given is so far in accordance with facts as to be worthy of consideration.
Of this the reader can judge fairly from the records, so that no time
need be spent in discussing it. But it is impossible to state fully—
because no one knows, or can know—the exact circumstances under
which the knowledge was obtained and given out by the medium. The
value of the evidence, therefore, depends partly on the honesty of the
medium and partly on the competence of the observers. The latter
point may be judged of indirectly from the records, which show what
precautions were taken, (a) to prevent information reaching the medium
by normal means, (b) to distinguish information that could have reached
her normally from that which apparently could not.
The honesty of the medium is a more difficult problem ; because we
must recognise the possibility that she might either consciously or
unconsciously present knowledge obtained by ordinary means as if it
were acquired supernormally, which is precisely what in these cases is
meant by " deceit." It is not customary in ordinary life to associate
this word with any subconscious or unconscious condition, nor is it
customary to analyse it or to do anything but simply anathematise it,
and it may seem highly dangerous to be prepared to do anything else ;
yet on consideration it will be perceived that every piece of information
given must be acquired somehow, and the whole interest of the pheno
menon from our present point of view depends primarily on whether the
information was acquired normally or not. The first question before us
is whether the source of information can be shown to be supernormal ;
it is therefore necessary to assume that whenever the knowledge could
have been acquired normally it was so acquired. Hence a discussion
of normal means of obtaining information, and how far they may be
presumed to go, becomes of the essence of the question.
XLIV.] Introduction to Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 63
In fairness to a medium, it must be admitted that it is not always
easy to be certain of the limits of the power of normal acquisition, or to
set bounds to the power of our organs of sense, so as to be able to
discriminate clearly where sense-perception merges into a form of clair
voyance or crystal-vision lucidity. Thus, take the case of a lady who,
holding an unwrapped copy of the Times before her face to act as a fire
screen, saw a few hours later in a glass sphere an announcement of a
death which subsequent investigation showed to be contained in its
obituary column (see Proceedings S.P.R., vol. V., p. 507 ; a similar case
also in the Journal S.P.R., vol. I., p. 246) ; it would, of course, have to be
assumed that she had obtained the information through normal vision
with her eyes, even though genuinely unconscious of the fact. Or take,
again, the case where the contents of a letter, delivered into the post-
box of a house, becomes known in a dream to a person who believes
himself to have remained in bed, normally quite unaware of any such
letter (I cannot now find a record of the case of which this is my
recollection ; but there is something like it in Phantasms of the Laving,
vol. L, p. 375 ; also vol. II., pp. 385 and 444 ; also in Proceedings S.P.E.,
vol. XIV., pp. 279 and 280) ; the hypothesis would at least have to be
considered that in a state of somnambulism he had read the letter and
sealed it up again, for some other member of the family to open later.
Or take the case of Mrs. Piper, who ostensibly read part of a letter,
which I gave her, by the process of undoing it and applying it to the
top of her head : it would have to be assumed that she had glimpsed
its contents by her normal eyesight, unless evidence to the contrary
were strong. Such a case might, of course, be one of conscious fraud :
the application of the letter to the top of the head being then a mere
deceitful artifice to divert attention from the real intervals of normal
reading.
Nevertheless it is quite imaginable, in any given case, that the
medium might genuinely think she had got the whole of the informa
tion in a supernormal way, while the truth was that some part of it.
or even the whole, had been really obtained normally, or, if not quite
normally, yet by hyperaesthesia—extra quickness of the appropriate
sense organs.
It needs but a small acquaintance with hypnotic and automatic
phenomena to be well aware that the hypnotic subject or automatist
is frequently deceived as to the source of his impressions; not only
may he suppose that an impression originated in his own mind when
it really came from without (e.g. from the hypnotist) or vice versa ; but
also he may suppose it came through one sense when it provably came
64 Dr. Oliver Lodge. [PART
through another. A little careful analysis of our own experience will
show that we sometimes make similar errors as to the sources of impres
sions in ordinary daily life. Examples of the kind referred to are con
tained in the Proceedings S.P.R., vol. IV., pp. 532-4. In the first case a
boy appeared to read clairvoyantly or telepathically the number of the
page of a book held facing the agent, but with its back to the boy ;
and when asked to indicate the place where the number was, pointed
to the back of the book just opposite the number's true position.
Nevertheless there is reason to believe that the number was really
seen reflected in the cornea of the eye of the " agent " or person facing
him, though this image would certainly be an extremely small thing
to read, and could hardly be legible to a person not somewhat hyper
sensitive. Nevertheless M. Bergson, who observed the fact and
suggested this explanation, felt sure that the boy's real belief was in
accordance with his own statement, and accordingly supposes it to be a
case of simulation inconscient.
The second example is referred to more at length in the Journal
S.P.R., vol. I., p. 84, where Mrs. Sidgwick reports on a case of reading
or glimpsing with elaborately bandaged eyes through chinks so small
and deceptive that the observer could hardly tell with which eye he
was dimly seeing, and might conceivably be unaware that he was
seeing in a normal way at all.
Certainly in cases of hypnosis, where suggestion may be dominant,
it is easy to suppose that the subject may believe himself to be
receiving impressions in any way which is either actually or artificially
in the mind of the operator ; and it is a familiar fact that suggestions
which are given in one state often take effect as if they were quite
spontaneous when the subject has entered another state, no connection
between the two states being remembered. (See a number of curious
instances observed and recorded by Mr. Gurney in Proceedings S.P.R.,
vol. IV., pp. 268 et seq.)
There is therefore a further difficulty when an attempt is made to
discriminate between what a medium knows in her own proper person
and what she knows in trance or in her secondary personality. In
hypnotic experience it is usually found possible to distinguish these
two reservoirs of knowledge or memory from each other, and to find
that they are independent, or at least that they consistently simulate
independence. There seem to be all grades of this independence of
memory in different states. (See especially Gurney's article in Pro
ceedings S.P.R., vol. IV., p. 518, etc. ; also the report by Dr. Milne
Bramwell, vol. XII., pp. 193-5 ; see also, for something of the same
XLIV.] Introduction to Sittings vAtli Mrs. Thompson. 65
sort in secondary personality, the Leonie case, vol. V., p. 397.) But
such a hypothesis is too dangerous and lax to be applied to the present
instance. It is quite possibk that the entranced medium may not be
fully aware of some things that have been told to the medium in her
ordinary state ; but for evidential purposes it must obviously always
be assumed otherwise. Everything known to the normal Mrs.
Thompson must be considered equally known to the ostensible
" control " speaking with Mrs. Thompson's mouth.
If it had been found in any one case that she had deliberately
deceived a sitter, this would of course throw grave doubt on all other
cases, even those in which it appeared that no deceit was possible.
Now, she does, when in trance, often refer to facts known to her when
in her normal condition ; the " control " seeming sometimes aware,
and sometimes unaware, whether the facts are so known or not. But
the sitters who have had most experience of her trances (especially
Mr. Piddington and Mrs. Verrall) have been struck by her constantly
telling them—either during the trance or afterwards—that certain
facts were so known to her normal state, and are not to be regarded
as supernormally known. Instances of this will be found in the
narratives, which follow. «
On the other hand, there are cases in which, without any such
warning to the sitters, she has made statements about special facts as
if they came to her supernormally which (a) she might have learnt (e.g.
Miss Harrison's names, see Mrs. Verrall's paper, pp. 208-210) or (b) there
is strong evidence that she '/''•/ learn by normal means. Cases like
these are what in the subsequent discussion we call " suspicious circum
stances," and it is on them that Dr. Hodgson's unfavourable judgment
depends.
As I have already indicated, persons who are familiar with automatic
phenomena will admit that it is possible that Mrs. Thompson might
have learnt these facts unconsciously and given them out with no
deliberate intention to deceive. And in favour of this it may be urged
that a witness who watched an incident of the kind (see below,
p. 162) had the impression that it was to be so interpreted. On
the other hand, Dr. Hodgson, who did not see such an incident occur,
but had strong reason to think it had occurred, believes that Mrs.
Thompson acted consciously and deliberately. Plainly, each reader
must be left to form his own judgment on these incidents.
Whatever view is taken, we must all admit that a certain amount of
what may, in the technical sense, be called " deception " is involved, or
is liable to be involved, in the phenomenon for the reasons above given.
66 Dr. Oliver Lodge. [PART
This deception need not in any case be voluntary, and its occurrence
may depend on a certain want of co-ordination between different strata
of personality in the medium—if it be supposed that a " control " is a
secondary personality,—so that information conveyed from one stratum
may be received and given forth as a genuine supernormal message by
another stratum, having been misinterpreted and perhaps distorted in
the process of transfer.
It must be noted, however, that in the case of Mrs. Thompson such
instances of apparently unconscious transmission of information, without
cognisance of its source, seem to have been only occasional, and do not
in any way suggest the existence of an organised subliminal fraudulent
scheme : nor do they indicate an elaborately organised and complex
scheme of subliminal romance, such as Professor Flournoy experienced
in the case of Helene Smith, many of the elements in which he traced
to normal sources, though there was every reason to suppose that the
medium was unaware of their real origin.
I myself have been accorded opportunities of sitting with Mrs.
Thompson many times, sometimes with Mr. Myers, sometimes alone,
and I have become impressed with her absolute sincerity, and real
desire, not always successful, to avoid every normal assistance or other
aid : which aid, when employed, while it may for the moment
fictitiously appear to improve the phenomenon, really undermines its
most essential feature.
I propose now first to quote, from the Report of the Psychological
Congress in Paris, Mr. Myers' general introduction ; then to give the
series of Dr. Van Eeden, and of the sitter known as Mr. Wilson ; then
to give Dr. Hodgson's report, together with some observations of a
similar character, as noted by Miss Johnson ; and to conclude with
the series of Mrs. Verrall.
It is not to be supposed that this collection represents any large
proportion of all the work that Mrs. Thompson has been good enough
to do for the Society, but it is all that we propose to publish at the
present time.

II.
ON THE TRANCE-PHENOMENA OF MRS. THOMPSON.
BY THE LATK F. W. H. MYERS.i
Inlroiluction.
I.—Trance is a name applied to a form of automatism, whether
healthy or morbid, in which the automatist appears to be in some
way altered, or even asleep, but in which he may speak or write
certain matter of which his normal personality is ignorant at the
time, and which it rarely remembers on his return to waking life.
If there appears to be not merely a modification but a substitution
of personality in the trance, it is called possession. Trance occurs
spontaneously in so-called somnambulism, as a result of disease in
hysteria, and as a result of suggestion, etc., in hypnotic states. A
fuller analysis shows classes which slide into each other in various
ways.
1. The trance may be simulated and the utterances fraudulent ;
the facts which they contain having been previously learnt, or being
acquired at the time by a " fishing " process.
This is usually the case with professional dairvoyantes.
2. The trance may be genuine, but morbid ; and the utterances
incoherent or in other ways degenerative, even when showing memory
or accuracy greater than normal.
This is the case in hysteria, so-called demoniacal possession, etc.
This group of cases has been admirably analysed by Drs. Pierre
Janet, Binet, etc., in France : Drs. Breuer and Freud, etc., in Austria :
and elsewhere.
3. The trance may be genuine and healthy, and the utterances
coherent, but containing no actual fact unknown to the automatist.

This is sometimes the case in hypnotic trance ; and the " inspirations
of genius " may approach this type, which seems to be illustrated by
Prof. Flournoy's subject, Mile. Helene Smith.
4. The trance may be genuine and healthy, and the utterances
may contain facts not known to the automatist, but known to other
persons present, and thus possibly reached by telepathy; or existent
elsewhere, and thus possibly reached by telcesthesia.
5. The trance may be genuine and healthy, and the utterances may
contain facts not previously known to the subject nor always known
to the observers, but verifiable, and such as might probably be included
in the memory of certain definite deceased persons, from whom they
profess to come. This form of trance may suggest a temporary sub
stitution of personality.
II.—During the past 25 years I have seen many specimens of the
three former of these classes, and a few of the two latter and more
interesting types. Records of the Rev. W. Stainton Moses' case, and
of Mrs. Piper's case, with others analogous, have been printed in the
S.P.K. Proceedings. I have now to describe a third well-marked
case of this type,—the case of Mrs. Thompson.
This case, while quite independent, is closely parallel to Mrs. Piper's.
I hope to produce, in a longer paper to appear in Proceedings S.P.L'.,
a series of testimonies, from a large group of competent witnesses,
who assert that facts have been uttered to them through Mrs. Thompson
entranced which could not have become known to her in any normal
way.
The hypotheses of fraudulent preparation and of chance-coincidence
appear to be quite excluded. There seems to be some telaesthesia and
some telepathy ; but most of the matter given suggests the character
and the memory of certain deceased persons, from whom the messages
do in fact profess to come.
III.—I claim that this substitution of personality, or spirit-control, or
possession, or pneumaturgy, is a normal forward step in the evolution of
our race. I claim that a spirit exists in man, and that it is healthy
and desirable that this spirit should be thus capable of partial and
temporary dissociation from the organism ;—itself then enjoying an
increased freedom and vision, and also thereby allowing some departed
spirit to make use of the partially vacated organism for the sake of
communication with other spirits still incarnate on earth. I claim that
much knowledge has already thus been acquired, while much more is
likely to follow.
XLIV.] Trance-Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 69
CASE OF MRS. THOMPSON.
Following on this introduction, it seems best to give, in such brief
form as my limits allow, a few details which may answer obvious
inquiries, and which may prove useful to persons who may have the
chance of investigating similar cases.
I. —History of the Case.
It is through the kind permission and co-operation of Mr. and Mrs.
Edmond Thompson, of Hampstead, London, N.W., that I am enabled
to present a record—inevitably imperfect indeed, yet fairly representa
tive—of certain phenomena which have accompanied Mrs. Thompson
from childhood down to the present day. The case is the more
interesting in that these phenomena arose among a group of persons
unfamiliar with such experiences, and have ever since been closely
linked with Mrs. Thompson's own private life and family affections.
Mrs. Thompson was born in 1868,—the daughter of an architect in
Birmingham. Mr. Thompson, whom she married in 1886, then held
an important post in a firm of merchants, and has now for some years
conducted a business of his own as importer of isinglass in the City of
London. Mrs. Thompson thus is not, nor ever has been, a paid or
professional medium.
Mrs. Thompson's distinct realisation of her own powers dates only
from 1896, when, in consequence of certain perplexing experiences, she
sought advice of Mr. F. W. Thurstan, a graduate of Cambridge, long
known to me, who has rendered great service to this research by
affording opportunities (at considerable expense of time and trouble to
himself) for the recognition and development of psychical gifts. Mrs.
Thompson, who was already interested in spiritualism, saw the
announcement of Mr. Thurstan's meetings, and attended them for
some.time. Introduced by his kindness to Mr. and Mrs. Thompson,
I have known them intimately since 1898; and they have agreed with
me that it is the clear duty of persons possessed of supernormal powers
to keep an accurate record of phenomena, and to publish so much of
that record as may be possible with serious care. For what follows,
therefore, I claim entire genuineness. I believe that there has been no
attempt whatever to exaggerate any incident, but an honest desire on
the part of both Mr. and Mrs. Thompson to utilise for the benefit of
Science a gift which they fully recognise as independent of personal
merit ;—a trust placed in the hands of individuals selected by some law
ss yet unknown.
70 F. W. H. Myers. [PART
Mrs. Thompson, I would add, is an active, vigorous, practical person :
interested in her household and her children, and in the ordinary
amusements of young English ladies, as bicycling, the theatre. She
is not of morbid, nor even of specially reflective or religious tempera
ment. No one would think of her as the possessor of supernormal
gifts.
II.—Modes in which Messages are given.
These, with Mrs. Thompson, cover nearly the whole range of
automatism already familiar to the student.
1. In the first place, Mrs. Thompson frequently sees spirits standing
in the room, who sometimes, though not always, indicate their identity.
Sometimes ' these figures form scenes, like the scenes discerned in
crystals, but life-size. Thus a glove-fight which my son had witnessed
at Eton was partially reproduced as though by figures standing behind
him. Similar auditory impressions are sometimes also received, re
sembling either internal or external voices, heard by Mrs. Thompson
alone.
2. Writing is sometimes seen on walls, etc. ; again resembling the
writing seen in crystals.
3. Pictures are often seen in a glass-ball (crystal). These pictures
fall into the ordinary categories. Some of them seem meaningless
and dream-like ; some of them represent scenes actually passing else
where ; some of them are symbolic of future events. Sentences some
times appear ; which, oddly enough, look to Mrs. Thompson (who
alone has seen them) just like scraps of coarse printing ;—as though a
piece of newspaper were held beneath the ball. There have even
seemed to be ragged edges, as though the paper had been torn. Such
indications are of interest, on the assumption that the pictures may
come from outside her own mind, as seeming to show that it may be
easier to produce a picture—in this case a picture of printed words—•
which is in some way copied from objects materially existent already.
4. Mrs. Thompson sometimes writes automatically, in a waking state.
5. But such writing is generally produced during a brief period of
sleep or trance. There will be an impulse to write, followed almost at
once by unconsciousness ; and scrawls, more or less legible, will be
found on awaking.
6. But the most frequent mode of communication is by speech in
trance ; intermingled with occasional writing, and claiming to come
from some definite spirit who " controls."
The entry into the trance is swift and gentle. As a rule there is a
XLIV.] Trance-Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 71
mere closure of the eyelids as in sudden sleep. If the control be an
unfamiliar one, there may be a few deep inspirations. The awaking
also is a mere opening of the eyes,—sometimes with a look of bewilder
ment. If the sitting has been a success, there is a feeling of rest and
refreshment,—which may indeed develop into unusual peace and joy.
The impression made on the observer is that the trance is as natural as
ordinary sleep. Mrs. Thompson believes that her health has derived
marked benefit from these trances.
III.—Choice of Sitters.
In selecting sitters I have naturally aimed at getting persons who
were unknown to her, and not giving hints or suggesting replies. I
naturally also wished to give opportunities to savants, and especially
to colleagues on the S.P.R. Council, such as Sir W. Crookes, Professor
Sidgwick, etc. Experience soon showed that it was practically unim
portant whether Mrs. Thompson knew the sitter beforehand or not.
The quality of the messages has not been perceptibly modified by this
fact. Most of the best messages, in fact, have been given to absolute
strangers, while persons of whom much could easily have been learnt—
as Sir W. Crookes, Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick, Dr. Hodgson, etc.—
have obtained practically nothing. I can, however, perceive to some
extent on what circumstances success depends. Success depends partly
on the sensitivity of the sitter himself—when such sensitivity happens
to meet Mrs. Thompson's—in some way which we cannot explain.
But success depends much more on the question whether there is any
departed friend who is eager to communicate with the survivor, and
who has also learnt the way in which to do so.
In this, as in almost all points, Dr. Hodgson's conclusions, drawn
from his numerous sittings with Mrs. Piper, are confirmed by my own
observation with Mrs. Thompson. He had already observed that he
obtained the best results when he acted on the spirit-hypothesis ;—
dealt with the sources of information as if they were just what they
professed to be, and thus got from each spirit in turn all that it could
give him.
Still more markedly, I repeat, is this the case with Mrs. Thompson.
The knowledge given—whether consisting of earth-memories or (as
appears) of actual fresh observation of things on earth, made from the
spiritual world—arranges itself most naturally, almost inevitably,
under the names of certain informants around whose special memories,
and powers of fresh acquisition, the scattered facts and ideas emitted
are seen to cohere. One is, in fact, talking to a series of friends, each
72 F. W. H. Myers. [PART
of whom has a characteristic, but limited, budget of news to tell one,—
and also a characteristic, but limited, power of observation or collec
tion of fresh facts. I find that the important thing is to interest if
possible (on behalf of each fresh sitter) certain departed friends of my
own,—some of them already familiar with these inquiries before their
decease. If these or similar willing and capable spirits will intervene,
some measure of truth is sure to follow. In this, as in an earthly
inquiry, I have to work outwards from a small nucleus of persons and
ideas already intimately known. Other sitters (as Dr. van Eeden)
have had the same experience with their own special groups.
IV.—Arrangement of Sittings.
The actual sittings are of the simplest type. I bring an anonymous
stranger into a room where Mrs. Thompson is, and we simply await
her trance. I sometimes ask my anonymous friend to remain silent
(if, for instance, his accent should give some clue to nationality) or
else we talk together on trivial topics until Mrs. Thompson's light trance
supervenes,—with no external symptom except a closing of the eyes
and certain slight differences in manner. It does not matter where
the visitor sits, nor is any contact desired. There is no " fishing " for
information. I usually converse myself with the "control"; and in
some of the best sittings I have been as ignorant as Mrs. Thompson
herself of the family history, etc., of the sitter. To give one instance
only, this was well exemplified in the case of Miss A. D. Sedgwick (the
American novelist), whom I took with me for a sitting on the very day
on which I made her acquaintance. I knew Miss Sedgwick's name and
her books ; Mrs. Thompson knew nothing of her whatever, but a vein
of memories was at once opened which developed with so much of
intimate family matter that only a scanty selection from what was said
can be offered for publication. This series of memories was fully
begun by an alleged spirit-friend of Miss Sedgwick's, while I alone
was the interlocutor. Afterwards Miss Sedgwick joined in, but gave
no hints ; and indeed various facts were given to her which lay quite
outside her own memory. This last remark suggests a brief review of
the habitual contents of these messages.
V.—The Matter giixn falls under Four Main Cfa.ss«.s, whose Proportion.*
vary with the Sitter.
(a) Dream-like and confused talk, with mistakes and occasional
approximations. This probably proceeds mainly from Mrs. Thompson's
own subliminal self, and occurs when there is no valid "control." It
XLIV.] Trance-Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 73
does not seem connected with any clear consciousness, and when it
occurs now it is usually stopped by some " control," who puts an end
to the imperfect trance ;•—much as one rouses oneself up from a
confusing doze, so as either to wake or to sleep properly.
(li) Facts lying beyond the sensory range, but not necessarily
implying discarnate spirits as their source. Such are perceptions of
events actually occurring at a distance, or of events which have
occurred in the past or will occur in the future. It is at present
impossible to say how far Mrs. Thompson's own subliminal self, cr
how far any discarnate fellow-worker, is responsible for the singularly
varied mass of knowledge thus given.
(c) Next come facts purporting to proceed from discarnate spirits,
—and such as might probably exist in their memories. But in this
case, of course, as in Mrs. Piper's, the majority of these facts exist also
in the minds of the sitters, so that it is possible to argue that they
are telepathically drawn from thence by the sensitive's subliminal
faculty, without any intervention of spirits of the departed.
(d) There remains a small but significant group of facts which are
not known to the sitters, but which would have been known to the
departed persons from whom they profess to come;—or (and this is
still more curious) facts which are such that those departed persons
would have been interested in learning them after death. The gradual,
incidental accumulation of facts of this type becomes at last a strong
argument for the authenticity of the alleged communications.
I believe, then, that I have good reason for ascribing many of these
messages to definite surviving personalities, known while on earth to
friends of mine whose presence with Mrs. Thompson has evoked the
messages, or to myself.
I believe that most of these messages are uttered through Mrs.
Thompson's organism by spirits who for the time inform or " possess "
that organism ; and that some are received by her spirit in the unseen
world, directly from other spirits, and are then partially remembered,
so that the sensitive can record them on emerging from the ecstatic
state.
But although I cannot ignore the evidence for these extreme hypo
theses, I by no means wish to assert that all the phenomena in this or
in any similar case proceed from departed spirits. Rather, I am
inclined to hold that whenever an incarnate spirit is sufficiently
released from bodily trammels to hold any conscious intercourse with
the unseen world, that intercourse will inevitably include various
types of communication. I think that there is likely to be knowledge
74 F. W. H. Myers. [PART
derived telepathically from incarnate as well as from discarnate spirits ;
—and also telaesthetic or clairvoyant knowledge of actual scenes, past,
present, or future, which lie beyond sensory reach. If I speak with a
friend on this earth I am at the same time conscious in many ways
of the earthly environment ;—and similarly I imagine that even a
slight and momentary introduction into that unseen world introduces
the spirit to influences of that still more complex environment,
mingled in ways which we cannot as yet disentangle. The sensitive
may thus exercise concurrently several forms of sensitivity ;—receiving
messages of all degrees of directness, and perceptions of all degrees of
clarity.
These ideas are far removed from ordinary scientific experience. It
may still seem, I fear, almost impertinent to offer them for the con
sideration of a Congress of savants. Yet I ask that this case be
considered along with two other cases brought forward at the same
Congress :—namely, Professor Flournoy's case of pseudo-possession in
M11e. Helene Smith, and Dr. Morton Prince's case of multiplex
personality in " Sally Beauchamp." ' It is hard to say which of these
cases, if narrated fifty years or even twenty years ago, would have been
considered the most bizarre and impossible. Yet all competent
psychologists will now agree in considering Professor Flournoy's and
Dr. Prince's cases as records of high value to the student of human
personality. Before setting my case aside as unworthy of similar
consideration, I invite psychologists to study Part XXXIII. (vol.
XIII.) of the S.P.R. Proceedings, where Dr. Hodgson has discussed
at length the closely similar case of Mrs. Piper. If that record be
compared with the forthcoming record of Mrs. Thompson's case, in
[the present Part] of the same Proceedings, it may perhaps be felt, by
some at least of the rising generation of psychologists, that few tasks
can be more interesting and important than that of discovering, in-'
vestigating, and comparing as many as possible of these extraordinary
variations in the ordinary human type—variations which, although
often degenerative, are also sometimes, in my view, distinctly and
rapidly evolutive in their tendency.

XLIV.] Account of Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 75
III.
ACCOUNT OF SITTINGS WITH MRS. THOMPSON.
BY DR. F. VAN EEDKN
(of Btissum, Holland).
WE may say of students of psychical phenomena that they fall into
three different groups :—the complete disbelievers, the spiritualists, and
the non-spiritualists.
Among the serious men of science who have taken the matter in
hand patiently and without prejudice, complete disbelievers are
becoming scarce. We need not here discuss their opinion.
But the believers in the genuineness of the phenomena are still
divided into two well-defined parties.
The first group accepts almost completely the view of the spiritists
and believes in the influence of spirits, of impalpable and, in the
ordinary way, imperceptible beings, upon the mind and body of a
living human being.
The second group acknowledges the facts as extraordinary and
inexplicable by ordinary causes, but does not admit that as yet any
thing has been discovered which forces us inevitably to believe in the
existence of spirits. Everything may perhaps be explained, according
to them, by faculties personal to the medium, such as telepathy and
clairvoyance.
To the first group belong, as we all know, very distinguished
men of science, such as Alfred Eussel Wallace and Sir William Crookes,
and also the man whose loss we so deeply deplore, Frederic Myers.
To the second group belonged, I believe, that other President of this
Society, whose loss we all regret, Professor Sidgwick ; and to it there
still belong Mr. Podmore and others.
The first theory is much the simpler as an explanation. Once given
the possibility of the action upon our own existence of beings whose
material conditions of existence are quite imperceptible and even incon
ceivable for us, all the rest is easily explained. As a philosophical
conception this view has nothing in it absurd or improbable. On the
F
76 . . . " Dr. F. van Eeden. [PART
contrary, as a matter of probability, we must agree that it is far more
likely that there exists an infinity of imperceptible beings, even in our
immediate proximity, than that we should be the ultimate form of
life, or that we should have reached an exhaustive power of perception
of other living beings. We know that our sensory perception is limited
to five modes, or channels, each of them embracing only a small part
of an infinite scale of vibratory motions. It is, philosophically speak
ing, quite as absurd to believe that every form of life and existence
must fall under our power of observation, as that there are no other
celestial bodies but those which our eyes can see.
We must keep in mind the philosophical tenet, well expressed by
Spinoza, and as far as I know never contradicted or considered open
to contradiction, that God's infinity has an infinite number of modes :
" Infinite, infinitis modis;" that is to say, there is not only infinity in
sequence of time, or in extension of space, but also in diversity of
being at the same place and at the same time.
The second group of observers, however, while accepting the
philosophical possibility, or even probability, of the existence of
other beings, angels or spirits, near us and able to exert influence
upon us, maintain that it is scientifically right to oppose as long
as possible the theory of their agency or intervention to account for
the phenomena. Premature use of such a theory would indeed be
far too easy a method and not in accordance with scientific economy,
which prescribes the utmost restriction in the employment of final
causes and the utmost care in every step towards the unknown.
Telepathy and clairvoyance being once recognised as realities, and the
marvellous faculties of the unconscious or subliminal mind being taken
into consideration, we must not speak of spirits until it becomes
absolutely necessary.
This second platform seems to be quite unassailable from the
theoretical side. It is always very difficult to prove strictly that a
certain fact has been out of reach of the medium's unconscious observa
tion during the whole of his lifetime ; and this difficulty grows into
absolute impossibility, if we admit a faculty like clairvoyance, of which
we cannot tell if it has any limits either in space or in time.
Let me give an instance from my own experience with Mrs.
Thompson. We had taken every precaution at my first sitting that
the medium should hear nothing about my coming, my name, or my
nationality. I came unexpectedly, and remained an almost silent
witness. And yet, at the first sitting, the name Frederick —my
Christian name and that of my father—was given; an apparent
XLIV.] Account of Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 77
attempt was made to pronounce my surname ("Fon," " Fondalin "),
and an allusion was made to my medical profession.
At my second sitting, though I had not seen Mrs. Thompson in the
interval, the name " van Eeden " was given in full, pronounced as if it
were read by an Englishman (Eden), also the name of my country
("Netherlands"), and the Christian names of my wife ("Martha") and
of one of my children were given, and at the beginning of the third
sitting the name of the place where I live ("Bussum").
These different names were given more or less at random, not
always in their proper relation, but nevertheless in such a way that
simple guessing was out of the question. She began, e.g. (at the third
sitting) to call me "Mr. Bostim," "Bussom" or "Bussum," mistaking
the name of my place for my own name ; then she asked what
"Netherlands" meant; she said at the first sitting that I had a
relation called Frederik ; at the third, that it was my own name, and
that I was a "gardener of Eden," and so on. At each following sitting
this confusion became a little clearer in her mind.
To explain this, coincidence will not do, as every one who studies
the notes must acknowledge. Four suppositions are possible :
(1) Conscious fraud. This presupposes a system of secret informa
tion, a detective service, of incredible extent and precision. I may say
that to know Mrs. Thompson is to discard this idea.
(2) Unconscious fraud. On this hypothesis, it is necessary to assume
that by some marvellous power of deduction the medium can connect
names, seen here and there on letters, cards, or papers, with an
unknown visitor whom she sees for the first time.
(3) Information by spirits. This is the explanation given by Mrs.
Thompson herself. On this view, the spirits talk through her mouth,
while she herself is dreaming about other things. She tells her dreams
sometimes after waking up.
(4) Clairvoyance and telepathy. According to this theory, Mrs.
Thompson reads particulars about me from my mind or from else
where, unconsciously, and constructs a dramatic figure, a fantastic
being, a spirit, who is supposed to tell her all this.
How can we eliminate the supposition of imposture ?
The possibility of fraud seemed untenable. I got information about
objects whose origin was known only to myself. I brought a lock of
hair of a man who had lived and died at Utrecht, and the hair was
immediately connected with that name, and on subsequent occasions
referred to as the " Utrecht hair." I brought a piece of clothing that
had belonged to a young man who had committed suicide. Nobody in
78 Dr. F. van Eeden. [PART
the world knew that I had kept it, nor that I had taken it to England
with me for this purpose, and yet I got an exact description of the
young man and the manner of his suicide, and even his Christian
name was given.
For me this excluded all fraud or coincidence.
Certainly, this evidence would not be convincing for anybody who
doubted my faculty of memory and observation, or my veracity. But
no evidence is in itself sufficient. It all requires repetition and corro-
boration by others. This is exactly what we look for.
The choice between spirits and telepathy remains. But the difficulties
involved are deeper and more complicated than we might think at first
sight.
The telepathic hypothesis implies that my thoughts were communi
cated, without ordinary means, to the mind of the medium. But at
what distance ? May we take for granted that this way of communi
cation, concerning which we have no knowledge whatever, falls under
the laws of light and sound 1 Or can there be only telepathy when
I am in the same room, or when I make an effort of volition 1 And
how can we avoid or exclude the telepathic influence of all other
persons in all other parts of the world 1
At first sight one would say that telepathy was excluded when the
medium tells me a thing I did not know myself. This has, indeed,
been considered by many previous researchers as a crucial test.
But let us consider this crucial test well, for we here come across an
unscientific or unphilosophical method of reasoning, very common
indeed, but most misleading. To rely on this test involves a tacit
assumption of knowledge which we do not as a matter of fact possess.
Our present knowledge of the conditions of telepathy is not know
ledge, but simply a sort of vague idea of what is likely, an " Ahnung,"
as the Germans say.
We think it likely that distances count in telepathy, distances in
time and in space ; in the case of experiments, we think it most likely
that there will only be telepathic influence between two persons at
the same time in the same room, one of them making an effort of
volition, the other remaining passive. But we have no right to
maintain that these conditions are essential.
Who could contradict me if I were to say that the information
which was unknown to me was obtained by telepathic action from
some other person somewhere in Holland or in some other part of
the world 1
Still more vague and ill-defined are our notions of clairvoyance.
XLIV.] Account of Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 79
And it is just because our knowledge of its conditions and laws is so
small that we can explain nearly everything by it, and that conse
quently it is impossible to talk of crucial tests.
We all know that our subliminal part is a first-rate dramatist. Our
dreams are comedies or dramas most astonishing to ourselves. We
can order hypnotised persons to perform this or that rdle, and they
will act their part with wonderful talent and accuracy.
In this way, every spirit that is represented, no matter in how
life-like and convincing a manner, can be explained away. If we
admit the faculty of clairvoyance, which can procure information
concerning everything and everybody, concerning all places and all
times, concerning the past and the future, what miracle of evidence
<an the spirit produce that will outweigh the fatal objection that he
is simply a dramatic creature of the medium's brain, constructed with
the help of absolutely unlimited information 1
For instance, the young man who had committed suicide gave as
proofs of his identity Dutch names of places and persons which were
not at all in my mind at the moment. This might have been un
conscious telepathy. At the same time proper names were given which
I had never heard myself. I did not even know such names existed.
Yet later, in Holland, I came across people who bore these very names,
though their connection (if any) with the young man I could not find
out. But what value could they have as proof of identity ? Could
we not always say that the medium, being clairvoyant, had seen these
nan.es somehow in connection with the young man, and so used them
to complete the vraisemblance of her creation ?
Thus it is clear that evidence of this kind must remain incon
clusive.
On the other hand, we know nothing of the conditions under which
spirits may or must work on the human brain, nor whether distances
count or not in that regard, any more than we do in the case of
telepathy.
AB a very curious observation, I may relate the following : The
young man, as mentioned in the notes of my sittings, had recovered
from his first attempt at suicide (though the control, "Nelly," did not
find out this particular), but the wound in his throat left his voice
hoarse and gave him a peculiar little cough. As soon as I came near
Mrs. Thompson with the piece of clothing, her voice became more or
less hoarse, and by and bye the same peculiar little cough appeared,
and grew more accentuated at each subsequent sitting. After three
sittings it kept on even in the intervals between the sittings, and
80 Dr. F. van Eeden. [PART
in the end did not leave her altogether until I had left England, taking
with me the piece of clothing—a flannel vest.
Here distance seemed really to be of import, and, what is most
curious, the influence seemed to emanate from an inanimate object.
It reminded me of what a French author called "I'&me des chases,"
the soul of things.
Now, it is just as difficult to disprove the other view, that there is
no telepathy, no clairvoyance at all in these phenomena, but that
everything is the work of spirits. According to this view—as main
tained by superior minds like A. Russel Wallace—spirits surround us
everywhere and always, and are constantly occupied in trying to
give us impulses, ideas, or fantasies. These influences are pleasant
or disagreeable, useful or dangerous, insignificant or marvellous,
according to our impressionability, our healthy or morbid physical
condition.
By this means telepathy, clairvoyance, all the phenomena of the
subliminal intelligence, even dreams and the hallucinations and mental
aberrations of the insane, may be explained.
This position seems to me as strong as the other. While studying
dreams and the disturbances of the diseased mind, I have often had a
vivid impression that, in some instances, they could only be the result
of evil influences working from the outside, like demons with diabolical
scheming and prevision. It must have struck every observer how
often it appears as if a wicked spirit takes advantage of the weak and
ill-balanced condition of a human mind to assail it with all sorts of
dreadful, grotesque, or weird ideas and fantasies.
To explain all these morbid phenomena as the work of the uncon
scious or subliminal mind, or of a secondary personality, often seems
forced and insufficient. Moreover, considering the matter philo
sophically, are the terms: "unconscious," "subliminal," " secondary per
sonality," clearer and more scientific than the terms demon, spirit, or
ghost t Is it not often a simple question of terms 1 What difference
is there between a secondary or tertiary personality and a possessing
demon ?
The strongest objection to this view, I think, is that we are able to
create secondary or tertiary personalities by means of hypnotic sugges
tion, and that it is unlikely that we could create demons in that way.
But then, again, do we know what we are doing by hypnotic sugges
tion ? Decidedly not, as I am entitled to say after fifteen years of
practical experience. And is it not possible that we, by our hypnotic
suggestion, are working on the mind in exactly the same way, and
XLIV.] Account of Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 81
therefore with the same results, as the invisible spirits do ? I, for my
part, feel unable to deny this possibility.
We are obliged in this difficult matter to rely a good deal on our own
personal impressions, to judge by probability, and to form more or less
intuitive conceptions. This may not appear very exact, but it is
unavoidable, and we shall find a similar course pursued in many other
branches of science. Astronomy, for instance, is based principally on
personal impressions,—but impressions which are verified by many
persons, and on intuitive ideas of probability,—but ideas which are
confirmed by repeated observation.
My personal impression has varied in the following manner. During
the first series of experiments, in November and December, 1899, 1 felt a
very strong conviction that the person whose relics I had brought with
me, and who had died fifteen years ago, was living as a spirit and was
in communication with me through Mrs. Thompson. A number of
small particulars, which will be found in the notes, produced on me
when taken en bloc the effect of perfect evidence. To regard these
all as guesses made at random seemed absurd : to explain them by
telepathy forced and insufficient.
But when I came home, I found on further inquiry inexplicable
faults and failures. If I had really spoken to the dead man, he
would never have made these mistakes. And the remarkable feature
of it was that all these mistakes were in those very particulars
which I had not known myself and was unable to correct on the
spot.
Consequently, my opinion changed. There were the facts, quite
as certain and marvellous as before. I could not ascribe them to
fraud or coincidence, but I began to doubt my first impression that
I had really dealt with the spirit of a deceased person ; and I came
to the conclusion that I had dealt only with Mrs. Thompson, who,
possessing an unconscious power of information quite beyond our
understanding, had acted the ghost, though in perfect good faith.
In so doing, she must have been guided by slight involuntary
tokens, positive or negative, on my part. How, otherwise, could she
have given so many true details, sufficient to create an impression of
perfect evidence, and how otherwise would she have made mistakes
exactly on the very points on which I was unable to correct her 1
But on my second visit, in June, 1900, when I took with me the
piece of clothing of the young man who had committed suicide,
my first impression came back, and with greater force. I was well
on my guard, and if I gave hints, it was not unconsciously, but on
82 Dr. F. van Eeden. [PART
purpose; and, as will be seen from the notes, the plainest hints
were not taken, but the truth came out in the most curious and
unexpected ways.
Take this for instance. Nelly said to me: "You don't seem to
have any whiskers. I don't see your head properly, some one covers
up your head. He [i.e. the suicide] covers up your head to show
how his own head was covered up. Oh, dear ! isn't it funny 1 You
must not cut off your head when you die,"
The fact is that the head of the young man was covered up when
he was found dead.
Nelly did not take the hint that the first attempt at suicide had
failed. And yet she gave details which unmistakeably, though
indirectly, refer to that failure ; e.g. " when they found him he could
not speak " ; and again, " don't take me back to the horror of it " ;
which two sayings are in exact accordance with the ineffectual attempt,
after which he was found alive and quite conscious, but with an open
windpipe. The second time he shot himself through the heart and
died at once.
The following described very exactly both his character and his
attempt at suicide. " He would not show me any blood on his neck,
because he was afraid I should be frightened."
This is quite like my dead young friend. He was very gentle
and always tried to hide his mutilated throat in order not to horrify
children or sensitive people.
Up to the sitting of June 7th all the information came through
Nelly, Mrs. Thompson's so-called spirit-control. But on that date
the deceased tried, as he had promised, to take the control himself,
as the technical term goes. The evidence then became very striking.
During a few minutes—though a few minutes only—I felt absolutely
as if I were speaking to my friend himself. I spoke Dutch and got
immediate and correct answers. The expression of satisfaction and
gratification in face and gesture, when we seemed to understand
each other, was too true and vivid to be acted. Quite unexpected
Dutch words were pronounced, details were given which were far
from my mind, some of which, as that about my friend's uncle in a
former sitting, I had never known, and found to be true only on
inquiry afterwards.
But being now well on my guard, I could, exactly in this most
interesting few minutes, detect, as it were, where the failures crept
in. I could follow the process and perceive when the genuine
phenomena stopped and the unconscious play-acting began. In hardly
XLIV.] Account of Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 83
perceptible gradations the medium takes upon herself the r6k of
the spirit, completes the information, gives the required finish, and
fills in the gaps by emendation and arrangement.
E.g. the Dutch names which are to be found at the beginning
of the sitting on June 7th were written by Mrs. Thompson in her
sleep while I was absent. These names are very remarkable, as I
had never heard them ; so my own telepathic influence, at least so far
as my ordinary consciousness is concerned, was excluded. But when
I asked Nelly who was " Notten, Velp," and who was " Zwart," I
got very quick and definite answers, purporting to come from the
young suicide, which answers were afterwards found to be absolutely
wrong. I even found that the name " Zwart " must have been mis
read, and that what was really written was " I wait.'' Nevertheless
Nelly made out of my mistake a fictitious friend of the deceased
called " Zwart," who shot himself in the forehead.
That same summer I came twice into contact with persons bear
ing the name "Notten" and living at "Velp," but I failed absolutely
to find out in what relation, if any, they stood to my deceased
friend.
We see here how recklessly and carelessly the control-spirit Nelly
enters into explanations about things of which she evidently under
stands nothing, though she has referred to them spontaneously her
self. And we see, moreover, how easily and imperceptibly the rdle
of any spirit is taken up by the medium, after the genuine infor
mation has ceased.
The principal thing that brings this on is encouragement. As
soon as the control-spirit or the medium is encouraged and helped
in an enthusiastic way, she goes on and on, making her creation
complete, until nothing true or genuine is left. This accounts for
the dreadful muddle in which so many honest observers have
ended.
And here, I think, I may make a definite and clear statement of
my present opinion, which has been wavering between the two
sides for a long time. I should not give any definite statement if
I did not feel prepared to do so, however eagerly it might be
desired, for I think it the first duty of a scientist and philosopher
to abstain from definite statements in uncertain matters. And in
observations like these we must reckon with a very general inclina
tion to deny on second thoughts what seemed absolutely convincing
on the spot and at the moment. Every phenomenon or occurrence
of a very extraordinary character is only believed after repeated
84 Dr. F. van Eeden. [PART
observation. After the first experience one's mind refuses to stay
in the unaccustomed channel of thought, and next morning we say :
" I must have been mistaken, I must have overlooked this or that,
there must be some ordinary explanation."
But at this present moment it is about eight months since I had
my last sitting with Mrs. Thompson in Paris, and yet, when I
read the notes again, it is impossible for me to abstain from the
conviction that I have really been a witness, were it only for a few
minutes, of the voluntary manifestation of a deceased person.
At the same time, I feel sure that genuine direct information
is far rarer and scarcer than the medium believes, and in good faith
would have us believe. I hold that a certain amount of uncon
scious play-acting is nearly always going on at every sitting of every
medium, and that even our most scrupulous and careful observers,
such as Myers and Hodgson, have been misled by it. I doubt not
only the veracity but the actual existence of the so-called control-spirits ;
to me it seems not improbable that they are artificial creations of the
medium's mind, or—according to the spiritist view—lying and pre
tending demons.
In considering what method to adopt in future investigations this
question is extremely important ; since every medium gets a certain
education from his or her leaders or observers, and the effects of this
education are generally unalterable. The education, as a medium, of
Mrs. Thompson has been an immense improvement, compared with
what we have been accustomed to. After all the poor mediums literally
spoiled and bewildered by too credulous and fanatical experimenters,
Mrs. Thompson's quiet self-control and scrupulous neutrality is very
gratifying. And yet I cannot avoid expressing my opinion that her
wonderful faculties as a seer have been spoiled by too much credulity
and encouragement on the part of the principal observers and leaders
of the experiments. I have seen how soon the so-called control-spirits
begin to fancy and to invent when we simply entertain the idea
of their genuine existence as controlling spirits. In my notes it
will repeatedly be seen that I asked : " How do you know t " because
I was aware that I only heard the conclusions of the control-spirit,
and not the direct perceptions of the seer. In the later sittings I
strictly abstained from talking to the control-spirit ; I took no notice
of her, but asked for exact information of what was seen or felt by
the medium. This attitude was not sufficiently persevered in by
former observers. Most of them entered more or "~~I
and spoiled the purity of the experiment.
XLIV.] Account of Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 85
I may sum up my criticisms by saying, that moat observers have
been, if not too credulous, then certainly too eager. This eagerness, in
comparison with which patience is often considered phlegmatic, is a
general weakness of the Anglo-Saxon. It accounts for his wonderful
achievements, but also for his mistakes. And this is true also in the
difficult domain of psychical investigation.
In a remarkable article entitled, " How it came into my head," Miss
Goodrich Freer, who is herself a seer, has well pointed out this want of
patience and passivity in psychical researchers, and the advice she
gives we may all take to heart. Nearly all the material that has been
collected up to the present needs revision : a sifting of the gold of
truth from the ore of play-acting and fancy. We can never have a
definite conception of the way in which this supernormal information
reaches us, and we are only too much inclined to form more or less
incomplete, materialistic, and superficial ideas about it. We speak
of the spirit playing on the brain, as a player does on a violin or
piano, and so on. We must also not forget that the statements
made come from regions where our conceptions of time are probably
invalid, which must, offer an insuperable bar to our powers of
understanding.
Let me mention one little fact in my experience with Mrs.
Thompson,—a mere trifle in itself, but still very curious. In one of our
first sittings Kelly predicted that I should get at a dinner in Cam
bridge "a red sauce with fish," which "would not suit me." I asked,
" Why not 1 " i but got no answer. In Cambridge the red sauce really
tamed up, and I took some, braving the prediction, and wondering
if it would make me ill. At the next sitting, I asked why the sauce
was forbidden me in the prediction, and Nelly asked, evidently at a
loss for an answer, " Well, don't you feel thirsty 1 " But I did not
feel thirsty at all. Then she said, "Are you a vegetable man?" Now,
I had never told Mrs. Thompson, or shown in her presence, that I was
a vegetarian by custom. But as the sauce was a fish sauce, and was
coloured with cochineal, the remark, made several days before, that it
" would not suit me," was perfectly appropriate ; yet the medium
appeared not to understand herself the appropriateness of her own
remark.
This little fact is, if well considered, full of unfathomable wonders
for our human mind. This trifling remark,—a little joke without any
deeD or serious meaning, but showing supernormal knowledge of the
o, " Why not ? " is not recorded in the notes, but I have no

86 Dr. F. van Eeden. [PART
future and of my own way of life,—made, as it were, by proxy and
without insight into its meaning,—how are we ever to grasp all that lies
beneath it ? Nothing in all the experiments gave me so vivid an
impression that the medium is simply an instrument, a tool, temporarily
in the power of beings who live, and can even jest, in regions beyond
space and time.
But let us take care, by all means, not to represent these beings in
definite forms according to our own dramatic fancy. We are sure to
produce what are called in anatomy " artifacts," artificial instead of
natural forms.
I have heard the source of this supernormal information denomin
ated by an English poet as " the collective memory of the race," and
this broad and mystical conception, however vague, seems to me in
some respects the safest working hypothesis for further investigation.
All will readity agree when I maintain that the trance-world of a
medium and the world of dreams are not very far apart. In both, the
human mind seems to possess some possibility of contact with a super
human world, " Anschluss am Absoluten," as the Germans say. In my
notes, I show that my own dreams, during the time of the sittings,
provided me with a name which I had forgotten, and which duly
appeared at the next sitting. And while I was preparing this paper,
nearly a year after the sittings, another dream gave me the solution of
the word " Wocken." which, as shown in the notes, was particularly
insisted upon by the young suicide. It was in my dream associated
with the title of the only book he had written, published after his
death, and for the success of which he was very anxious. (The solu
tion seems very probable, but I cannot publish it.)
Having observed my own dreams for a long time, making careful
notes of them, and having attained the faculty of executing in my
dreams with full presence of mind voluntary acts which I had
planned while awake, I arranged with the medium that I would
call her in my dreams after returning to Holland, and that in
her trance she would tell an observer in England if she had heard
my calling. All this is recorded in the account of the sittings in
Appendix I. at the end of this paper.
The result (recorded in full in Appendix II.) I may give in a few
words. The whole matter seems to me of great interest, and merits
an elaborate treatment, which, in years to come, if time and ability
allow, I hope to be able to devote to it. But this single interesting
experiment I will relate now, if only to draw attention to the possibility
of the new line of investigation that it opens up.
XLIV.] Account of Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 87
In the winter following the first series of sittings, Nelly
announced in the course of various seances, that on three occasions
she herself, and on another occasion another spirit, had come to
visit me in my dreams. In two instances these visits corresponded
closely in time with dream visions of my own, which I had recorded
in my diary previously to the receipt of letters from Mr. Pidding-
ton giving details of Nelly's statements, and in all four instances
there is evidence of telepathic rapport between Nelly and myself.
The second instance is the most remarkable. For then, in my
dream, I made what I thought to be a mistake and called out
"Elsie, Elsie," instead of "Nelly." I put down the fact in my
notes the next morning, the name Elsie being absolutely without
any meaning and quite strange to me.
Two days later I got a letter telling me that Nelly's spirit friend,
Elsie, had heard me calling, and that she had been sent by Nelly
to answer me. So my mistake was no mistake ; the name Elsie,
though strange to me, had come into my head by some mysterious
influence, and the message across the channel was received.
I have the notes and the letters to show to any one who takes
a serious interest in such matters.
After this, the communication stopped; only Nelly seemed to be
aware of two slight indispositions on my part; but the dream ex
periments wholly failed.
I will conclude this brief account by saying that I see before us a
limitless domain of strange knowledge and the possibility of most
important investigation, but that we need in this, more than in
any other branch of science, patience and prudence. Nowhere are
we in such great danger of complete error and entanglement, We
can form hypotheses, eschatologies, whole religious systems, accord
ing to our fancy, and the docile medium will show us all our
chimeric constructions in full action and bewildering semblance of
reality.
To avoid such pitfalls we must check all undue eagerness and
impatience in this most delicate and subtle of scientific quests,
which concerns the human soul and the superhuman world where
with it is conjoined. Passive in observation, patient in action,
prudent in advance, we must refrain from seeking to unveil with
over-hasty hands the secrets yet hidden from us by the Eternal
God.

DETAILED REPORT OF SITTINGS.
NOTE BT J. G. PIDDINGTON.
[Throughout the record, R.=right, W.=wrong, and D. = doubtful.
The notes of the first series of sittings are as nearly verbatim as the
rapidity of Nelly's utterance permitted. Special care was taken to note
down remarks made or questions asked by the sitter or note-taker.
The notes of the second series of sittings are not so full, but Dr. van
Eeden is responsible for the greater part of them, and confidence may
therefore be felt that nothing of essential importance has been omitted.
The omissions, which are indicated thus . . . , with one or two very slight
and totally unimportant exceptions, have reference to matters unconnected
with Dr. van Eeden.
All explanatory notes and comments, in so far as they refer to his own
affairs, friends, relatives, etc., have been either written or dictated by Dr.
van Eeden, or submitted for his approval, although, for the sake of clearness,
they have usually been changed from the first to the third person. They are
printed in square brackets, the sentences iu round brackets relating to what
was said or done at the sittings.
It will be observed that most of the statements made by the medium in
these sittings purport to come from " Nelly," a child of Mrs. Thompson's,
who died as a baby. The medium is therefore generally referred to as
"mother" by the control.]
SITTING I.—NOVEMBER 29TH, 1899.
At 65 Rutland Gate, S.W., 4.30 p.m. Present: Mrs. Thompson, Mr. and
Mrs. Crackanthorpe, Dr. F. van Eeden, and J. G. Piddington (note-
taker).
[Dr. van Eeden arrived in England the night before the first sitting. He
was accompanied to 65 Rutland Gate by J. G. Piddingtou. His name was
not given to the servant to announce, but was known to Mr. and Mrs.
Crackauthorpe.]
Nelly. " What does Mr. Savant want?"
(Van E. hands small end of cedar pencil to Mrs. T.)
Nelly. "Pencil gives impression of preaching to a lot of young men. . . ."
(J. G. P. gives an envelope, handed to him by van E., to Mrs. T.)
Nelly. " I get a feeling about a lady with this. Feels like a piece of dark

"Strong influence of lot of stairs, some one lives very high up—tall

many stairs. See p. 103.]
"The lady connected with the envelope had something taken out of her

" Belonging to the lady of the hair (i.e., hair in envelope) was a soldier.

[The lady had a brother, a soldier, who, when not on active service, died at
the age of 39 from a fall from his horse.]

"Do you know Astratoff? but the gentleman there (van E.) knows him
very well—not very well, associates with him. He is a Swede." (Here
followed what seemed to be expressions of disapproval of Astratoff.)
[If this refers to Mr. Aksakoff, he is a Russian, not a Swede, and van E.
has had only a slight correspondence with him.]
(To van E.). "Bring something next time belonging to the young man
who died prematurely at 22."
[Van E. has been unable to identify the young man of 22.]
"Fondalin—Fohnmer—Fomineer." [Various attempts to pronounce a
proper name, with the Dutch pronunciation. Fondalin seems like an
attempt at " Van Eeden."]
" Everybody has a Frederick connected with him, but so has that gentle
man (van E.) too. He was fond of experimenting with medicine bottles,
like Sir W. Crookes, you know. I mean the young man who died at 22.
"Ordinary doctor was father or brother or very near relative of this
young man."
[Frederik is van E.'s Christian name, and also his father's. The father
never made chemical experiments, but the son has, a good many years ago.
All this seemed to van E. an attempt to define his personality.]
"... This gentleman (van E.) thinks he is going back on a certain day,
but there will be some commotion which will make him change the date of
departure—either one day earlier or later."
[The day of van E.'s departure was not fixed at time of sitting, but he
left England several days later than he had intended originally.] . . .
"There is a Marie belonging to that gentleman (i.e., van E.) (Mrs. T.
takes van E.'s hands.) I do like you, but I can't creep round you a bit. . . ."

at times probably ; but van E. thinks she did not cheat with him.]

to my enquiries, told me that the personal description ascribed by Nelly to Elaie is not
in accordance with the facts ; for Elsie, whom Mrs. Thompson knew well, and saw as
late as four days before her death, had colourless lightish brown hair cut short and
straight across her forehead. Elsie died at about six years of age. Nelly, who died
when only four months old, had very dark brown curly hair, most unlike her mother's.—

"It is a 'clog' country where the old gentleman lives [R.]. The old gentle
man went to stay there—he had relations there. The noise of clogs could be
heard on the pavement. He had greasy hair like yours (to van E.)—only

[" Rather shrunk " would be correct.] •
" Had a fur collar when he went to clog country. He went to a

"The old gentleman belongs to a country where there is a Queen [R.]
not a Republic. The lady seems to have belonged to a Republic [W.].
" Some one belonging to the old gentleman was drowned in a pleasure
accident a long time ago. It was a young man. He is all excited now when
I asked him to recite an account of it.
"The old gentleman never forgot it, although the accident occurred
when he was a young man."

" I think the accident occurred when larking, not a serious accident."
Van E. " Was the old gentleman present at the accident ? "

"He used to wear a wedding ring: no stones in it—a tight ring— it
was quite tight. [R. It is the Dutch custom for men to wear wedding
rings ; van E. himself was wearing a similar ring, which fitted very

had been in a lady's possession several years. The hair belonged to her
dead husband. This may explain the subsequent confusion.)

health [R.] because she was always hot and cold all over—had to wipe her

the head reminded van E. strongly of the death scene of the man to whom
the hair belonged.]

" Do you know that name like Makosky (?) [No meaning.]
" They [sic] don't speak English like this gentleman (i.e. van E.), but they
talk like very foreignly. They do speak English, but not fluently." [This
would be true of the relations connected with both pieces of hair.]
" Hair lady connected intimately with ' Meddi Makosti ' 1 and a Louise.
" Louise was a relation of hair lady | I ;. |.
" Hair lady used to make very beautiful lace for her amusement —worked
it with her fingers [W.].
" She used to look after an old gentleman—like her father—looked after
house and superintended for an old gentleman with a drab-coloured dog
[D.]. But this was not the old gentleman with the gloves [R.].
(To van E.). " I wish you would think about the dead baby. The hair
lady has the entire management of the dead baby [?].
"I can't make it clearer. I've muddled it all out as distinctly as
I can.
"It seems as if the lady's name was Utrecht—like Utrecht velvet."
[Husband and wife both lived, and husband died at Utrecht. See seance of
December 4th, 1899.]
'On November 21st, 1901, Mrs. Thompson, after reading the proofs of this record,
ipontaneotuly informed me that she had noticed an unexplained reference to " Meddi
Uakoski." She then explained that her daughter, Rosie, both for some long time
before, and probably also at the date of van E.'s sittings, had been at school with a girl
of the name of "Meddi Makoski." Mrs. Thompson had only heard the name pro
nounced, and is uncertain of the correct spelling. Her daughter had on several occasions
spoken about the girl at home, and her nationality had been discussed. When giving
me this information, Mrs. Thompson remarked : " You see how things in my conscious
memory come into the trance communications." On November 25th, 1901, Mrs.
Thompson's daughter, Rosie, wrote to me as follows : " Mother asked me to find out the
date the three Mieczmikowska girls left school. They left Midsummer, 1899. These
girls were not my friends, but I remember quite well (so does father) how we discussed
their nationality, the mother being Portuguese and the father Polish. I had never seen
the nune written until to-day ; when the girls were at school we always spoke of them
ii the ' Medgemakoskis.' "—Nate by J. O. P.

(Van E. hands to Mrs. T. the same hair in envelope that he had previously
given her at suance on November 29, 1899).
Van £. " Is it alive or dead ? "
Nelly. " Dead lady. It belonged to an older piece than the other ; it
belonged to an older person. [W.]
(To van E.) " Why didn't yon bring your boy with you ? You ought to
have brought him. It would have been an education for him."
[Van E. recognised this as an appropriate remark.]
(To van E.) " You are going to see my mother in Paris next year. You will
be wearing a lighter-coloured felt hat at Paris than you are -wearing now. But
if you remember this prophecy you must not go and buy one on purpose."
[Van E. did meet Mra.T. in Paris in 1900; but Mrs. T. in her normal
state would have known this to be not improbable. He did not wear a
lighter-coloured hat].
" You were talking two years ago in Brussels at an association."
J. O. P. " What was it about " 1
Nelly. "Stuff that no one can understand,—philosophy, like Professor
Sidgwick. I don't know any more."
J. O. P. " In what part of Brussels ? "
Nelly. " It was a Congress. You know the ' North Pole '—' P61e du Nord '
—where people sing and dance. Turning out of the street in which was the
North Pole was the big hall where the Congress was held.
" I saw Dr. Bramwell in the street there. That gentlemani (i.e. van E.)
and Dr. Bramwell were at Congress together."
[Van E. has never given a lecture at Brussels. He attended a lecture
given at the Universit6 Nouvelle about two years ago, but did not meet
Dr. Bramwell there. Mrs. Thompson has been in Brussels.]
" Does Marie Louise belong to this 1 (i.e. to hair in envelope).
" Do you know Linden ? I associate the hair with ' Unter den Linden '—
not with the place, but with the name ' Linden.' "
[This is the family name of intimate friends of the husband ; and this
fact, unknown to van E. at the time of the sitting, was discovered by him
on subsequent inquiry.]
" The old gentleman when he wanted anything couldn't get up to ring the
bell, but had a stick by his side with which to knock on the floor. The old
gentleman told me that. I get clear messages from the old gentleman. He
says some one—a lady—came to him and brought him some funny cakes—
baked—to eat. It's like Martha—the name of the lady—Martha S."
[Mrs. van Eeden, whose name is Martha, attended on the old gentleman,
her father, in his last illness. Van E. states that the stick in bed with the
dying man and the cakes are very characteristic. At the sitting van E.
could not say if the statement about the cakes was correct or not, but
verified it on his return home.]
i Note by J. (i. P. " My original notes run ' van E. and Dr. Bramwell were at
Congress together,' but I feel sure Nelly did not mention Dr. van Eeden by name. I
probably wrote ' van E.' as a short equivalent to ' that gentleman.' "
XLIV.] Account of Sittings with Mrs. Tliompson. 95
'I see capital S by you (i.e. van E.) all the time. The name is like—a
short name—about five letters. Schlips—Schloss—not Schloss.
"He wasn't so patient as you are (to van E.). He is most impatient. He
wonld do like that (very characteristic pantomime of impatient gestures with
hands).
"It is like Schweitz — not Schweppes — an SH feeling about it —
Schwort.
" The old gentleman is very ' fumy ' [R.]. He poisoned his dog—because
the dog couldn't get better—a long time before his own death [D.]. He
always wanted to rule [K.].
" Do you know van Eeden 1—(pronounced ' Eden '). Somebody said that,
—somebody slipped in and said that, I think. Freidhof—Fitz,—begins like
Frederick and then goes off peculiar. Amsterdam, Freidham, Freidher.
Amsterdam came like a picture right across. Freidham was a man belonging
to this gentleman (i.e. van E.), but younger than he is."
[Van E. was living at Amsterdam when the old gentleman died. " Fray "
represents the English pronunciation of the name by which the old gentle
man called van E.]
" Your real name is Von Savant— only they don't call you that." [Nelly
referred to van E. as "Mr. Savant" at beginning of seance on November
29th, 1899.]
(To van E.). " Will you be sure to ask me about the name beginning with
S next time ? " ...
(To van E.). " Don't have any of that red sauce with fish at Cambridge.
It wouldn't suit you." [See second seance of December 4, 1899, p. 100.]
"Why that's—Talks like a Dutchman."
(J. G. P. asks Mrs. Thompson on awaking what she heard last as she came
out of trance, and she replied) :
" She's talking double Dutch—or something like that."

SITTING III.—DECEMBER 4TH, 1899.
At 5 Selwyn Gardens, Cambridge ; Sitting begins 5 p.m. Present : Mrs.
Thompson, Dr. F. van Eeden, and Mrs. Verrall.
[Notes taken by Mrs. Verrall.]
Nelly. " Don't mesmerise mother."
VanE. "No."
Nelly. "I see you doing it to people."
Van E. "No, I won't doit."
Nelly. " I can see in your past life that you hypnotise. If you are not a
foreigner, what are you called 'Frederick' for?" [The name "Frederick"
was pronounced oddly : an attempt at the Dutch pronunciation.] " How do
you pronounce it?"
Van E. "Frederik."
96 Dr. F. van Eeden. [PART
Nelly. "Yes. I telled you that before. Somebody's got something the
matter with the eyes. You hypnotise."
[When van E. treats patients he always begins with touching their eyes
so as to close them.]
Van E. "What person?"
Netty. " I don't know what."
Van E. " Was it long ago ? "
Netty. " Not while you were in London."
Van E. "Where was it?"
Nelly. " Like in . I know your name is Mr. Bosom, Bostim.
Come here, Mrs. Verrall, let me tell it to you. (To van E.). You are Mr.
Gardener Eden" (or "garden of Eden").
[" Gardener Eden "—not a bad joke on Nelly's part : as van E. farms at
Busmim].
Nelly. " Mr. van Eeden—It is Bus-som."
Van E. " I will put you on the right track. The place where I live is
Bussum. Have you a message from the old gentleman ? (Gives the gloves.)
There was a word with an S in it."
Nelly. " If it does not come now, you won't be cross ? "
Van E. " No."
Nelly. " Mr. Myers has got a c in his name. This gentleman (i.e. van E.)
has a k. [i.e. Frederic Myers and FrederU- van Eeden.] You have that silly
name of Bussoni because you are a foreigner. It's a name of Holland."
Van E. " Can you tell me about the old gentleman ? Put your hand
inside the glove."
Netty. " He's got somebody belonging to him who is a doctor."
Van E. "How do you know?"
Nelly. "He says : 'My son is a doctor'—not in that sort of talking."
[The old gentleman was van E.'s father-in-law, but had also a son—
who is a doctor in Oriental Languages.]
Van E. " IB it a son ? "
Nelly. " No, it's like a brother. They are all medical ; there's a lot of
medical men belonging, not all medical, but doctors."
Van E. "Can you distinguish his voice? He wanted to say a word with
an S."
Nelly. " The lady belonging to the hair is alive " [R.].
Van E. " You made a mistake about the hair, you mistook the man's hair
for the lady's. The hair was in possession of a lady."
Nelly. " You have a dead brother who is a genius [W.]. Do you know
what id PHI . . . It's a gentleman, not the one of the gloves, that you are
friendly with. He's just had some one died, belonging to him—vaii
Ron. ..." (an attempt followed to pronounce von Renterghem). [It should
be noted here that the name von Renterghem occurs next to van Eeden's in
the list of members of the 8.P.R., and that van E.'s address, Bussum, appears
in the same list.—J. G. P.] "He writed with you about mesmerism—a
review—a foreign name."
XLIV.] Account of Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 97
[Van Kenterghem and van E. practised and wrote about hypnotism in
collaboration.i]
(To Mrs. Verrall). " This gentleman (i.«. van E.) and another are fond of
hypnotism."
Van E. " Oh, I see."
[Van. E. made this exclamation as it suddenly struck him what the name
was which Nelly was endeavouring to pronounce.]
Nelly. " He was fond of joining you in partnership when you talk
mesmerism. He had a lady belonging to him who died."
VanE. "Recently?"
Netty. " Yes. Ask him will he give something belonging to that lady next
time. I'll tell you all about it."
[This reference to a " lady that died " has no relevance, so far as van E.
ean ascertain.]
Van E. " Can you tell me about the old gentleman and the word ?"
Nelly. " Shuber, like Schubert, not Shuber—Sh—Sh—Sh—"
VanE. "Can you tell me the name of the old gentleman or of his
favourite place ? "
Netty. " When he was alive, you hadn't got a queen. There was
some one else. There was a great commotion, he remembers all about
it Through a kins? or a queen there was a commotion in the town.
He had a diaries [W.] and a Frederick belonging to him—and like an
Eden."
[The old gentleman died in 1883. In 1879 the second marriage of
William III., King of the Netherlands, was celebrated.]
"When he slept in bed he had a night-cap on—everybody does not wear
night-caps."
[It was not a night-cap, but usually a silk wrapper.]
"He has somebody belonging to him ill now, not very ill, has to lie
down and be careful."
Van E. " How do you know 1 "
Nelly. " I see a picture of a lady lying down, she ought to be in bed. She's
not well at all."
[R. for surviving wife of the old gentleman.]
"The old gentleman had a long pipe—with a long stem : he's not smoking
it—in his hand—it's on a rack on the wall by the fire-place."
Fan E. " Does he never smoke it ? '
Netty. " It's at the back of the chair where he used to sit. [He never used
to smoke.] There's lota of books in that room, lots and lots of books [R.].
i On November 21st, 1901, Mrs. Thompson, after reading the proofs of this record,
ipontaneonsly told me that she bad been given a copy of Proceedingt S.P.R., vol. XI.
(1895), by Mr. Myers, who wished her to read his paper on Betotute Credulity. On
looking into the volume on November 21st, 1901, she noticed that it contained a review
by Dr. C. L. Tuckey of a work on hypnotism, written in collaboration by Dr. F. van
Eeden and Dr. W. A. van Renterghem ; but that, so far as she was aware, this wu the
first time that she was conscious of having seen it. —Note by J. O. P.
98 Dr. F. van Eeden. [PART
He could think stronger than he could talk. You (van E,) can talk—he
could think stronger."
[It was a matter of concern to the old gentleman that he could not talk
so well as he could think.]
Van E. " Does he say that himself ? "
Nelly. " Yes. He's got a very magnetic sort of hand, it would soothe your
head if it were put on it."
Van E. "The old gentleman's or mine?"
Nelly. " The old gentleman's. He did not exercise it. Have you got the
old gentleman's black silk tie ? It has been with this " (i.e. gloves).
Van E. " No. But I can ask. Ask for the word with an S. Is it the
name of a spirit 1 "
Nelly. "Yes. When he says it he shortens it. Shuber—Shulof—Sh—
Sh— '
" The old gentleman's head was muddled before he died. Shofto. When
he says it distinctly I'll tell you. What is Bossom ? "
Van E. " That's where I live."
Nelly. " He wants you to send his love to them—to those people at
Botsom."
Van E. " Can you tell me the name of his favourite place ? "
Nelly. "Am-felt—hamfelt—handfelt—belonging to you." [The name ought
to have been Haarlem.] " When the old gentleman went out in the garden
there were white things sticking up on the right-hand side, like stone things
[not recognised]. He keeps imitating a violin, he wants to be where they
played the violin. There's a very large church-like building, where glass
windows are. He likes to hear the music at the church place. I am trying
to find the name." [Perhaps the church at Haarlem, where concerts are
often held.]
Van E. " It's nearly right."
Nelly. " It's like Shovelt. It's difficult. They have to say the word and
tell Mrs. Cartwright, and she tells me."
Mrs. V. " You were very clever with my names, Nelly, you saw pictures
of them ; but it's easier in English."
Nelly. " He [i.e. the old gentleman] could speak English, but not like you
(i.e. van E.) [R.]. I won't talk about Schuman any more. I'll talk about
something else. . . ."
" Who's the William belonging to the old gentleman ? " [His eldest son.]
" He's alive, not very well, going about as if right ; may have a break
down, is overdoing it. You must not let him. His energy is more than
his vitality,—too strong for his strength. When he starts a thing he does
not listen to reason. He should be more rational." [All this is very probable.]
" The old gentleman is concerned."
VanE. "Why?"
Nelly. "He is concerned about William. He ought to take recreation
between. William's got thin hair, he has to comb it over." [Quite wrong
about hair.]
XLIV.] Account of Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 99
VanE. "Is it William?"
NeUy. " It's like Willem, Willeme " (pronounced Willemer).
[Very much like the Dutch pronunciation.]
VanE. "Yes, that's it."
Nelly. "He's got thin hair [W.]. I'll come to your country. I'll come
and talk with you. You've got somebody you can make -talk when put to
sleep. If you say, ' Now, Nelly,' I'll come if I can."
Van E. "Will you come in my dreams 1 "
Nelly. " But you've got curtains round your bed. I don't like them.
They are old-fashioned now."
[Bed curtains are becoming rare in Holland. Van E.'s sleeping-room being
at the same time his study, he has a drapery hanging before his bed.]
[See below for the dream visions of Nelly experienced by van E. on nights
of Jan. 2-3 and 14-15, 1900.]
Van E. " If yon saw better you would see why I have curtains."
Nelly. " Because it's got a thing to hide it. Because you don't want all the
people to see. You are funny."
Van E. " What's the matter ? "
Nelly. " I don't know."
Van. E. "I put the curtain up at night."
A'elly. " I don't know if I am in the right house. It's got a shiny floor.
There's a cupboard with little drawers." [There is a cupboard with little
drawers in van E.'s house and a floor with mattings.] " You'll faithfully
promise not to put mother to sleep. There is some person at your house,
whom you might put asleep as a medium ; she is very poorly."
Van E. " I can't understand whom you mean."
Nelly. " She has a pain at the top of her spine."
[There is somebody answering to that description living with van E.,
but he never hypnotises her and probably never will.] . . .
Nelly (to Mrs. Verrall). "Perhaps I'll talk secrets when you go away.
I shan't call you doctor (to van E.), though the old gentleman does. I can't
oblige you and call you doctor. You have not enough bottles, you don't
smell enough of disinfectants."
[Van E. does not practise medicine much now.]
"What was Paul ? He belonged to the old gentleman—a person not
Tery near. The old gentleman knows all about Paul."
[Paul is the name of van E.'s youngest son, born after the old gentleman's
death. Note the use of the present tense, " knows."]
"It is not your fault, nor Mrs. Verrall's, but the people all come and talk
at once. The old gentleman has a telling voice [ I :. |, not loud, but you could
hear it in a large room to the furthest corner ; it reached out."
Van E. " Can you ask about the hair ? "
Nelly. " The lady had it in a box with things that belonged to another
dead person : I >. ]. Your real name is foreign savant. I'll forgive you for
Baying Spain to mother."
[On walking away from the house with Mrs. Thompson after his first
100 Dr. F. van Eeden. [PART
sitting, when his nationality had not yet been discovered, van E. had talked
to her about Spain, not without some intention of seeing if Nelly would
follow up a wrong hint.]
Van E. " So you have heard that 1 "
Nelly. " Yes and another thing that Mr. Piddington said, that mother did
not struggle, nor pull faces, when she goes in a trance."
[After the second sitting, when Mrs. Thompson had left the room, and
perhaps the house, van E. and J. G. P. had talked about the quiet aiid easy
form of Mrs. T.'s trances.]
SITTING IV.—DECEMBER 4TH, 1899.
At 5 Selwyn Gardens, Cambridge ; 8.30 p.m. Present : Mrs. Thompson,
Dr. F. van Eeden, and Mrs. Verrall.
Van E. " Why did you tell me not to eat the red sauce \ "
Nelly. " I told you you would have it here."
Van E. " Yes, but was it dangerous for me ? "
Nelly. " Oh, no. Mrs. Verrall, do you often have it ? It is funny you had
red sauce with white fish. At mother's house you would have had white
sauce."
Van E. "But why was I not to take it ?"
Nelly. " Well, don't you feel thirsty ? "
VanE. "Not at all."
Nelly. " Are you a vegetable man ? "
Van E. " A vegetarian, yes ; but I sometimes eat fish, not to be rude to
people."
[See end of Sitting II., December 1st, 1899. Van E. writes : "At dinner,
remarking the red sauce, I asked if Mrs. Verrall had it often. Nelly was
evidently very much amused at this incident. She could give no explana
tion why she had forbidden me to partake of the sauce. But her question
if I was a vegetarian is very curious, the sauce being coloured with
cochineal.
" If this is the true explanation, we must admit that some other intelligence
was aware of the two facts : that I am a vegetarian, and that I should have
at Cambridge sauce coloured red with cochineal, which would thus 'not
suit me.' Nelly was evidently unaware of the connection."
Note by Mn. Verrall.—"The sauce was anchovy, but coloured with
cochineal, as we always have it. I had given no orders about the sauce,
having only said there would be boiled fish. When I selected the John
Dory I hesitated whether I would have a Dutch sauce, but decided to leave
the question of sauce to the cook."]
Nelly. " Have you got Scholmas now ? It's like Schoolbred ; it begins like
that. Do you belong to Mr. Kruger ?"
Van E. " No, he's no relation of mine."
Nelly. " Well, you say Dutch."
XLIV.] Account of Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 101
Fan E. " Kruger is Afrikander, not Dutch."
[This may refer to van E.'s political sympathies, but perhaps the conversa
tion at dinner had turned on the war.]
Nelly. " Have you got your brother's hair ? "
VanE. "No."
Nelly. " I wish you would bring it."
(Van E. gives the same box as at second sitting.)
Netty. " Not that hair—not Utrecht-hair."
Van E. " Why not ? (To Mrs. V., who was not sure of having caught the
name rightly) the name is right."
[Van E. was struck with the expression " Utrecht-hair," because it proved
that the name Utrecht was not said at random at the seance on December
1st, 1899.]
Nelly. " It belongs to a dead person, who had a lot of pain before they
died. It makes mother feel ill. Had he got cancer on the liver ? horrible
pain." . . .
[" The voice and gestures of Mrs. T. produced a strong impression on me
of very great internal pain."—Note by Mn. VerralL]
Ifrt. V. " Perhaps you might leave a message with me about it some other
time."
Nelly. " Mr. Hypnotism (i.e., van E.), the old gentleman is not the pain
person."
[It was the old gentleman though, who died from cancer of the liver. The
Utrecht person died from pneumonia.]
"The person of the hair is nearer to your heart [R.]. Besides you there
is a Frederik belonging to the person of the hair [W.]. What was Anna,
not quite that, Amma ? When this was—there are studs belonging to the
man, because he was a male person, but he was not old, not with whiskers,
he was young."
[He was about forty.]
"He had studs with something in the middle, not plain gold [D.]. Mrs.
Verrall, there's a Theodore belonging to you,i there's a Theodore belonging to
this gentleman [D.]. Don't mix them. There seems a Karl, a great friend
of this gentleman. This one could sing, you cannot (to van E.) ; he could play
a music that you blew, not a big thing (imitating a horn), just blow."
[He was very musical, and always wanted to play a trumpet, which he did
not, because his wife did not approve.]
" He's got something the matter with his inside, he's ever so uncomfort
able, he could hardly breathe.
"This is a description. I can ask him. He has a brother alive now
[W.] and a dog [W.] The dog and the brother are in the same house.
" There's a flat piano where this man lived [D.]—not a stand-up one like
that (pointing to piano). He used to drink quantities of milk | I .:. ]. He
used to have ... he was rather an experimenter [R.], fond of trying to

make something out of nothing, not mechanical ; he was clever in the head
for thinking, for inventions" [R.].
Van E. " Does he speak to you ? "
Nelly. " Yes, but yet I can't say he does ; he speaks to some one who tells
me. It's a difficult personality. He was not free, he resented outsiders
trying to know his affairs [R.]. He only told a choice few ; he was very
reticent ; that's the word" [R.].
VanE. "Quite different from the old gentleman ?"
Nelly. " Yes, more reserved [R.]. Wrapped up like a cigar you have to
unroll, unroll him and find what he is, find the tobacco. That's an illustra
tion. People misjudge him, thought he was too much wrapped up [R.].
He was a bright spirit ; would not do any one any harm [R.]. He went to
Italy [R.]. I think with you, with a Frederick. I think you can find
that out."
Van E. " He went to Italy, but not with a Frederick."
Nelly. "He has an uncle now alive [W.], who's a military man. I'm never
sure about relations."
[Many relations of deceased were military men. His uncle, who was an
officer, is dead.]
Van E. " Let us say a relation."
Nelly. " You should not have let him die; he was just beginning to be
at the very best of his life. People a lot older belonging to him could have
better died. He was not what you call pious or religious [R.]. He had a
high sense of goodness in nature, a religious feeling [R.]. He was a
strange character, a powerful character [R.] in a weak frame [W.].
"He always wore button boots [W.]. Sometimes had gaiter pieces,
spats . . . perhaps that's the buttons. I can see like gaiters, leggings.
Not all alike on his feet.
" He used to wear a hat like yours, a brown hat " [D.].
Van E. " Has he a message ? "
Nelly. " He wants you to collect those papers and finish it."
Mrs. V. (to van E.). " Do you understand ?"
Van E. " Yes."
[Perhaps this is about an unfinished literary work, in which he might
have been interested.]
(Here Mrs. T. seemed to want her handkerchief. Mrs. Verrall found it
and gave it to her. She put it to her face.)
Nelly. " The gentleman coughs. He makes me cough. Don't take him to
the hospital. I don't like this foreign country. I don't like this foreign
country—0 dear ! O dear !—get me out of this hospital. Mrs. Verrall—It's
not hurting my mother. The gentleman tried to talk—I saw them taking
some one to the hospital and thought it was me. I didn't want to go."
["All through this part of the sitting the impression of misery and
distress made on me was exceedingly vivid. It was as if a scene was being
vividly described of some one in a foreign country taken against his will to
a hospital."—Note by Mrt. Verrall.
XLIV.] Account of Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 103
Van E. baa not been able to ascertain what incident in the deceased's life
was described here. Some time before his death one of tin- employes at his
office, a German, was taken ill, and he had advised him to go to the hospital,
where be (the German) died.]
" You'll finish the papers and put them together and write a little bit at
the end and print them. Never mind the money, that'll come all right."
VcmE. "Thank you."
Nelly. "Give me the pocket-book."
Van E. " Is this it ? " (giving a red and a brown pocket-book).
[Van E. gave his own pocket-book, which had no connection with the
deceased.]
Nelly. " Yes, I think I mean this. It does not seem to be that gentle
man's influence. What's that red pocket-book ? " (Takes red in left and
brown in right hand.)
Van E. " Is it what you mean ? "
Nelly. " Yes." (So Mrs. Verrall's note : but van E. thought the answer
was negative.) " I want to tell you. That gentleman of the hair likes silk
handkerchiefs better than white ones. Not a rich gentleman, but thought
that if he lived longer he would have had a lot of money for it ; just when
he was going to have it, he died."
[He was not at all poor, but started a new line of business shortly before
he died.]
" You went up a lot of steps round and round, and both stood at the top
looking. [See first sitting, p. 89.] He was very fond of talking and thinking
about stars, astrology. If you were to find—he's got some treatise on it " [D.].
[These words were said more slowly, as if some one else were speaking.
This led Mrs. Verrall to say :]
Jfrt. V. " He is speaking now, is he not 1 "

he died he went across water to a foreign country. I don't know if it was
America. [It was Italy.] As a very young man he had typhoid fever [D.].
He has got a shiny mark here (touching left temple or a little lower).
What do you call it?"
Mrt. V. "A scar."
Van E. (to Mrs. V.) " What do you call this part of the face ? "
Mn. V. "The temple."
Nell;/. " Rather lower than the temple, Mrs. Verrall, on the upper part of
the cheek. Not very big. Just enough to know."

"There's Alfred belonging to him : he's much associated with Alfred [D.].
He always used to do like this : "
(Here Mrs. T. rose and walked to the fire, put her hands behind her, and
bent forward, rising on her toes, as she talked.)
[This was most characteristic.]
" When talking he used to bend forward, rock in front of fire, nearly tip
over. He didn't mind getting wet, he didn't take care enough. He used to
go out without an umbrella when it was pouring."
[The pneumonia from which he died was the consequence of exposure.]
" Now it's all gone dark, foggy. But I will come back." (After a pause.)
" There was an old gentleman cried ever so, and was so sorry wheii he died

At Hendon, Middlesex, 10 a.m. Present : Mrs. Thompson, Lady X., Dr.
van Eeden.
Nelly. "I want those treasures of the parcel. Is it you that wrapped
it up?"
VanE. "Yes."
Nelly. " Are these people dead ? Perhaps it's your influence." (Takes
parcel which contains relics of young suicide.) " I am frightened. I feel as
if I want to run away." (To van E.) "That lady won't be cross." (To Lady
X.) "Don't go away. I feel rather frightened. What's Marfa, Martha?
She's got a lot of people belonging to her."
Van E. " That's my wife."
Nelly. " She was not very well. It is better now. She went to lie down
[D.]. Old gentleman sends his love to Martha. He says : ' My love,
Martha.'
"This" (pointing to parcel) "is a much younger gentleman. Very
studified, fond of study" [R.]
Van E. " Why were you frightened 1 "
Nelly. " Because something seemed like a shock to me. He's not a rich
gentleman. If he lived a bit longer he would have had more. He wanted
to make some " [R.].
Van E. " How do you know ? "
Nelly. " Mrs. Cartwright tells me."
Van E. " Ask her why you were frightened."
Nelly. " She says because I was afraid of making faults."
[Obviously wrong.]
" Gentleman used to have headache at the back of his head. He used to
take tablets to make his headache go better " [D.]
"Stout William. Had a bad heart. Used to walk backwards and
forwards under some arches. A very knobly stick. He's got a sister

work "
[All references to " Stout William " unrecognised.]
Van E. "You have not told me the principal thing about this man" (parcel).
Nelly. "The principal thing is his sudden death [R.]. I can tell you better
when she (Lady X.) is not there. It frightens me. Everybody was
frightened, seeming to say ' O dear ! good gracious ! ' . . .
"This gentleman could shoot. He was rather an out-of-doors man.
What a funny hat he used to wear. Hound with a cord around. He had
a velvet jacket. You have a velvet jacket too, but not real velvet, and like
trousers [R.]. But that gentleman had real velvet jacket." [References to
dress D.] " I can't see any blood about this gentleman, but a horrible sore
place: somebody wiped it all up. It looks black" [the bullet wound
probably]. "I am happy because that man is happy now. He was in a
state of muddle. And when he realised what he had done, he said it is better
to make amends and be happy."
Fan E. " How did he make amends ? "
Nelly. " When any people want to kill themselves he goes behind them
and stops their hands, saying, 'just wait.' He stops their hands from
ratting their throats. He says, ' Don't do that : you will wake up and find
yourselves in another world haunted with the facts, and that's a greater
punishment.' He's got such a horror that anybody would do the same thing,
and he asks them to stop, and it makes him so happy." [He cut his own
throat, but recovered ; and afterwards shot himself.]
(To van E.). " You don't seem to have any whiskers. I don't see your head
properly. Some one covers up your head. He covers up your head to show
how his own head was covered up. O dear, isn't it funny 1 You must not
cut off your head when you die." [The suicide's head was covered up when
he was found dead. See p. 82.]

Van E. " My father, I presume."

There may have been some confusion with the suicide.]
"The gentleman is bigger than you. He will try and talk through
mother. How do you pronounce Hendrik ?"
Van E. "Very good, it is Hendrik."
Nelly says good-bye to everybody, and to Lady X., " I like you." . . .
[A'ote by van E.—I did not quite remember the name of the suicide,
and thought it might be Hendrik. A few days later I dreamt about
another friend of mine called " Sam," and I called out, " Sam ! Sam ! " in
my dream. I remembered then that the name of the dead man was also
Sam, or Samuel.]

SITTING VI.—JUNE STH, 1900.
At Mrs. Thompson's house, at 3.30 P.M. Present : Mrs. Thompson, Mr.
F. W. H. Myers, Dr. van Eeden, Mr. F. N. Hales (the latter unknown
to Mrs. T. and to van E.).
Nelly asks for the parcel : seems rather disturbed by the presence of a
stranger (Mr. Hales), says " This is a secret," and asks Mr. Hales to make
no notes.
Mr. Myers asks if she wants the stranger to leave.
Nelly. " No, but when one of your friends has committed suicide, you don't
want anybody to know." (To van E.) " Have you got Martha's letter ?"
VanE. "No."
Nelly. " It is a letter on tinted paper : she says somebody is much better
than they were." [No confirmation of this.]
" This person (of the parcel) talks foreign language [R.]. Has got
something about the throat" [i.e. the wound resulting from the unsuccessful
attempt at suicide] " talks not very distinctly [R.] He can talk English a
bit, but not many [R.]. He is standing before a desk with white knobs on
it [D.]. He was very disappointed and got depressed and got a headache.
Worried much [R.].
" Very friendly, and used to go about a good deal with a tall, fair man,
fair complexion." [He was intimate with a tall, fair man, who in tuni
committed suicide two days after him.] " They had a good quarrel." [Pro
bably right.] "I don't like that fair man. I don't believe iu him, don't
trust him. It was a shock to him (parcel-man) to find this out about his
friend [D.].
" Masters—who is Mr. Masters ? [?]
"What has this man (parcel-man) got on his left forefinger? A shiny
mark on his left forefinger "[D.].
Van E. " How do you know his throat was cut 1 "
Nelly. " I see it. An open windpipe."
Van E. " And did he die from that ? "
Nelly. " Of course. How could one live with an open windpipe 1"
["This was a plain hint, but Nelly did not take it. The wound in the
throat, resulting from the first attempt at suicide, healed ; the second time
he shot himself. This shows both how Nelly concludes falsely from partial
information and how slowly she takes hints."—Note by van E.]
(Mr. Myers and Mr. Hales leave the room.)
Nelly, (to van E.) "I want you by yourself. I do not like them to know
all these things. Would you like me to hold the parcel?" (Takes the
parcel. Long pause.) " Ought not I to be frightened ? He did it himself.
He was a very great friend of yours. Had greatest admiration for you.
Before he did it he told you about his work. He used to confide in
you [R.].
" It is not that he did not want to come himself, but the strange gentle

man upset him." [This because Nelly had promised that he would talk
himself.]
"He was alive when your Queen was crowned [R.]. He had a way, used
to be like that (swaying her hand) [R.]. I do love him—really I do. It
was a great shock to your wife. She said she could not have thought
it of him [R.].
"Something very peculiar happened to his uncle." [Statement about
ancle found to be true on subsequent enquiry.]
"Ought I to like the strange gentleman?
"This gentleman wore ring with a dark stone in it [D.]. He wrote some
letters that you read [R.]. You looked at them and said : ' How could a
man do such a thing that could write like that ? ' " [" This was my senti
ment, though I do not recollect having said the words."—Note by van E.}
(Coughing) "Could he not make the people have what he wrote ?"
Van E. " But he got his writings printed."
Hetty. " Yes, but it gave him no satisfaction [R.], He thought great
things of those things [R.]. You wrote a book, he admired it very much
[R.]. But he criticised it nevertheless [R.]. He does not seem to have had
a wife [R.]. I see him sleeping alone. Do you like that tall friend ? "
Van E. " You made a mistake about that friend. He is dead."
Nelly. " No, that's somebody else.
"This man (the suicide) is not suffering for having done this. He is only
sorry to think he caused his friends so much trouble. That tall friend is
something like Charles (?). When they found him (the suicide) he could not
speak."
VanE. "Was he dead?" (No answer.)
Nelly. " He said ' Don't take me back to the horror of it.' He did not
want any one to make him live." [See p. 82.]
" I never saw any one so gentle. He would not show me any blood on his
neck, because he was afraid I should be frightened. He always wanted to
save any one from trouble.
" Yon know somebody named van Renterghem."
Van E. "That's a different person."
Setty. "He's going to send something for you to look at [W.]. This is not
the cap-man."
Fan E. " Why a cap-man ? "
Xetty. " He wears something like a hat, a round hat."
Van E. " But that's no cap."
Netty. " Yes, it is a University hat."
Van E. " But you have the cap there in the parcel." [The parcel contained
a grey travelling cap].
Selly. "Oh, indeed. Nobody knows that. I thought it was his collar
and his vest."

always referred to a prominent character of some earlier sittings, at which
van E. was not present, as ' the cap-man.' She probably said, ' this is not the
cap-man,' meaning that there was some association of a cap with this indi
vidual, but that he must not be confused with ' the cap-man.' "]
Nelly. " If you ask, you get a lot more things from him. They got some
thing velvet belonging to him. I can't understand his English. He could
not speak so well as you [R.J, But he could read it [R.]. Your thirteen
year old is a boy " [R.].
Van E. " I never said a girl."
Nelly. " Does your wife mind ? How many Frederiks have you got I 1

people [R.]. Don't you think it would have all come right if he had waited?

He is very happy.
" Does your wife always wear a black dress? [W.J. I never see her in any
thing different [W.]. She wears a wedding ring—and another. She does
not wear many rings. The top ring is worn."
[" All this would have been perfectly right if applied to the lady of the
Utrecht hair. During my absence she had sent the ring to the goldsmith
for repair, as I heard on coming home."—Note by van JE.]
Van. E. "This must be somebody else. She wears no rings at all."
Nelly. " It may be somebody belonging to the cap-man. I do not want to
put you off. But next Thursday I promise you that he will speak. I want
you all by myself."
(Mr. Myers and Mr. Hales enter.)
Van E. " Tell me about Miss C.'s little brother."
Nelly. " It was a grown-up man saying ' This is my sister.'
" This matter (the suicide of the cap-man) was all in the newspapers. But
he is sorry, because there was a mis-statement of facts in one newspaper.
This grieves him, because it was already bad enough for his friends."
[The facts of the case were misrepresented in the newspapers to the
detriment of the deceased man's friends, but van E. could not find out what
particular newspaper was more to blame than the rest.]
" He wants to know why his life is to be talked over in a foreign country."

SITTING VII.—J ONE TTH, 1900.
At Mrs. Thompson's house. Present : Mrs. Thompson, Dr. van Eeden.
Since the last sitting on June 5th Mrs. Thompson has had a peculiar cough
quite unusual to her. It was like that of the suicide. [Mr. Myers writes :
" Mrs. T. independently told me that this huskiness began when she first saw
van Eedeu on this visit of his to England, and continued throughout his
stay, and went off' half-an-hour after his departure. She had no cold."]
Trance began at 3.15 after a long wait.
XLIV.] Account of Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 109
Nelly. " That gentleman that made my mother have a sore throat, he
came and tried to make mother write. He wanted to say something about
the name of that place."
Mrs. Thompson showed van E. what she had written on a sheet of paper
after the last sitting on June 5th, in a state of trance. It was :
Gotten Velp. [First name unknown to van E. Velp is a well-known
village in Holland. Van E. does not know if his friend had ever been
there. See p. 83.]
Zwart. [The dead man had no relations of this name, so far as van E.
knows. See p. 83.] (An illegible name follows.)
\\edttrijden. (Meaning " races," the ij being written u.)
[Races were held near van E.'s house every year.J
Nelly. " He has not come yet, but I am waiting for him."
(Van E. takes the parcel from a small bag.)
Xelly. " I don't want that glass bottle with brushes in it. I want the
treasures." (Takes parcel.) "The glass bottle is on the washing stand."
[There had been such a bottle in the bag the day before.]
" Do you believe in cremation like he does ? He has not got experience by
being cremated himself. But he wanted to be " [D.].
(Mrs. Thompson's hand tries to write with pencil on paper. Writes :
" Wedstruden " again. Long silence. Mrs. Thompson seems very restless,
feeling her throat with her hands.)
Felly. " He wants you to speak Hollands, Hollands."
(Van E. speaks a few words in Dutch, asking if his dead friend heard
and understood. After this comes a very expressive pantomime, during
which Mrs. Thompson takes van E.'s hands firmly as if to thank him
very heartily, making different gestures.)
Netty. " He understood. I was not talking through mother then. Your
journey to England has been very successful. I mean political [R.]. I
don't mean cap-man.
"This gentleman looks such a big man beside you. All this side (right)
i-s all light. He's got a dead brother [D.]. He was very much surprised
to meet him. He was dead longer [D.]. (Speaks hoarsely, like van E.'s
dead friend.)
"He could not talk better. All the time he is nearly in possession of
mother. That's what makes my mother's throat so." (Rummaging in the
parcel.) "I am trying to get a fresh place in the parcel.
"What's 'Vrouw Poss' . . ' Poss.'"
Van E. " Vrouw Post—Ik versta je."
[This was the exact pronunciation—the final "t" being but slightly
sounded in Dutch—of a name very familiar to van E. Vrouw ( = Mrs.)
Post is a poor workwoman who used to come to his house every day.]
(When van E. repeated the words and said " ik versta je " (I under
stand) Mrs. Thompson laughed very excitedly and made emphatic gestures
of pleasure and satisfaction, patting his head and shoulders, just as his friend
would have done.)
110 Dr. F. van Eeden. [PART
Nelly. " He is so glad you recognised him. He is not so emotional
usually.
" What is Wuitsbergen . . . Criuswergen ? "
[This is very nearly the right pronunciation of the word Cruysbergen,
the old name of van E.'s place, Walden. Van E. writes: "It is remark
able that it was not at all like the pronunciation of the word as if read by an
English person, but as if heard. This name is still in use among us, and my
dead friend used it always. The new name Walden, which was often iu
my mind, and which I even pronounced before Mrs. Thompson, never
came in her trance."]
Van E. " Ih weet wat je zeggen wil, zeg het nog eens." (" I know what
you mean, say it again.")
(Nelly tries again and says " Hans."
She then says that she is going away for two minutes. Mrs. Thompson
awakening says : " I smell some sort of anaesthetic stuff like chloroform.
I can taste it in my mouth. I was dreaming about being chloroformed, and
your trying to wake me up.")
["This is very remarkable, the taste being probably that of iodoform,
which was used in healing the wound in the throat of my dead friend.
Mrs. Thompson, in reply to inquiry, said that she did not know the smell of
iodoform."—Note by van E.~\
4.45. Trance came on again suddenly in the middle of conversation.
Nelly. " That gentleman was pleased and delighted."
Van E. " Why does he not give his name ? "
Nelly. " It is like Sum, Thuni, or like Sjam. Not quite this. Please, do
you pronounce it properly."
Van E. " Yes, indeed, it is Sam."
Nelly. "That is it. He says it sounded like Sjam through his bad
throat.
" There is a Charles, or what they call Charles in England. (Coughs.)
What's that stuff in my throat ? "
Van E. " I suppose that's what made mother (i.e. Mrs. T.) smell chloro
form."
Nelly. " Yes. Have you got his watch-chain ? >:
Van E. " No."
Nelly. " Sjom, Sjum. It seems that the thing he died for came all right
after. He said ' sprik Hollands,' ' Sam—Hans—0 Sam—Hoest.' (Hoest =
cough.) He wants to know who has got his books . . . his books."
" Spreek Hollands," meaning " speak Dutch," van E. asked iu Dutch :
"Hoe noemde je my ?" (" How did you call me ?")
Nelly. " He says it is not like Fred. He wants me to tell you all about
the Sunday that he was last with you. ' Wocken,' he keeps saying 'Wocken,'
' Brief voor.' . . . (' Letter for' ) . . . ' Hans geeft'm . . . '"

APPENDIX II.
(1) The last sitting of Dr. van Eeden's first series was on Dec. 4th,
1899. He returned to Holland a day or two later.
Extract from Sitting on Jan. 5th, 1900, 87 Sloane St., S.W. Present:
Mrs. , Mrs. F., Hon. E. Feilding, and J. G. Piddington.
Nelly, (to J. G. P.) " Tell Dr. van Eeden he kept calling me last night (i.e.
Jan. 4-5). He was inside those curtains. He wears curtains round his bed ;
he was inside them and he called me. I went to him and I think he knows
it. He told me so, and he is waiting to hear if you send my message. He
was asleep. 'Now, Nelly, you come to me and remember,' he cried out.
His wife was stout. . . . He was in bed alone, not with his wife, he was by
himself. He had had a hard day's work, yet was sufficiently awake to
call me."
J. G. P. sent a transcript of the above to Dr. van Eeden and
received the following reply :
Walden, Bussum, Jan. 10, 1900.
Dear Mr. Piddington,
In the diary of my dreams I find on January 3rd that I had what I call a
"clear dream "with full consciousness on the night of [Jan.] 2-3, between
Tuesday and Wednesday. In those dreams I have power to call people and
see them in my dream. I had arranged with Nelly that I should call her in
the first dream of this sort, and I did so on the said night. She appeared to
me in the form of a little girl, rather plump and healthy-looking, with loose,
light-coloured hair. [Note that at sitting on Nov. 29, 1899, Nelly had
described her hair as black and curly, in van E.'s hearing. See note ad loc\,
p. 90.—J. G. P.] She did not talk to me, but looked rather awkward or embar
rassed, giving me to understand that she could not yet speak to me ; she had
not yet learned Dutch. This was the second dream of the sort after my stay in
England. The first occurred on Dec. 11. In this dream I also tried to call
Nelly, but it was no success. Some grown-up girl appeared, who spoke
Dutch, and as my consciousness was not quite clear, I had forgotten that she
was to be English.
The particulars are true. I slept alone, in the bed with the curtain, or
rather drapery, hanging before it. I was extremely tired, and slept deeply
and soundly, which is always a condition for that sort of dream.
The mistake about the date does not seem very important, as it WM
probably the first sitting you had after Jan. 3. [It was the first sitting since
Dec. 18, 1899.—J. G. P.] ... Tell Nelly next time she was right about my
XLIV.] Account of Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 113
calling, and aak her to tell you again when she has been aware of it. But let
her not make guesses or shots. I shall try to give her some communications.
Yours very truly,
F. VAN EEDEN.
Nelly made no reference to Dr. van Eeden at sittings held on the
10th, 12th, or 16th of January.
(2) Extract from record of sitting of Jan. 18, 1900, at 87 Sloane
Street. Present : Mr. J. 0. Wilson (pseudonym) and J. G. Piddington.
At end of sitting J. G. P. asks Nelly : " Have you been to see Dr. van
Eedeu 2 "
Nelly. "No. I haven't. This is a mixture. Dr. van Eeden has sum
moned me twice, and Elsie,"—(here J. G. P. interrupted Nelly to ask who
" Elsie " was, not having heard her mentioned before) " a little girl that used
to talk before I came—Elsie Line—came to me and said ' Old Whiskers in the
bed is calling you.' "
/. G. P. " When was that ? "
yelly. "It was before the sitting with"—(Nelly then proceeded to describe
the personal appearance of a lady and gentleman, both unknown by name to
Mrs. Thompson, who had attended the sitting of Jan. 16). " Both times wa»
before that" (i.e. before Jan. 16). "I said: 'Bother Whiskers! you go
instead of me '—and very likely she did go. I hope he didn't think she was
me. You want my description. I haven't red hair. It's as light as mother's
— not red—more look of brightness like mother's—and then I've nicer eyes
than mother . . . dark, wide open eyes. I'm fat, and look as if I was seven ;
I am older." . . . [but cf. 'sitting of Nov. 29th, 1899, p. 90].
The following is an extract from Dr. van Eeden's diary.
Jan. 15, [1900]. After the letter from London, I made the plan to tell
Nelly in my dream the name " Walden " ; afterwards to tell her to think of
a little monkey of mine that died some time ago.
The dream began with a great popular festival somewhere near Brussels.
The music was very pleasant to me. Then I walked away towards moun
tains, and found myself before a large bay or inlet of the sea. Then I got
full consciousness and recollected my plans. At first I called out " Elsie !
Elsie!" but then remembering that this was wrong I called "Nelly! Nelly!"
Nobody came. I became anxious, feeling that she would not come, and
'ailed " Nelly, you must come, and think of Walden, Walden. That's where
I live." I did not pronounce the word monkey. I awoke without having
seen anybody.
(3) Sittings were held on Jan. 23rd, Jan. 25th, and Feb. 1st, 1900,
but no reference was made to Dr. van Eeden.

Directly after Mrs. T. had become entranced, Nelly began :
" Haven't you (i.e. J. G. P.) got a letter from van Eeden in your pocket ; "
[J. G. P. had not got a letter from van £. in his pocket, but had received a
letter from him on Feb. 2nd, i.e. subsequently to the last sitting on Feb. 1st.
Mrs. Thompson, however, would have known in her normal state that it was
at least not unlikely that correspondence would be passing between van E.
and J. G. P. at this time.]
" He hasn't been so frisky as usual—not so much up to his work—out of
sorts—not very well." [On Jan. 21st, van E. was suffering from a " rather
violent catarrh," which kept him in bed for one day, and in his room for two
days, his first indisposition for two years.]

[perhaps Jan. 26th, 1900]. I went there the night of the day when mother
had neuralgia after a sitting at your house [perhaps Thursday, Jan. 25th,
1900]—on a Thursday—but van E. wouldn't talk to me. That's how I
sensed he wasn't well ; and there's a boy who isn't very well at his
house."
Dr. van Eeden wrote on receiving the transcript of the notes of this
incident :
On Wednesday, Jan. 24, I went again to my hut and slept there, though
not yet quite " frisky." I had no dreams about Nelly, as my " clear " dreams
only come when I am healthy and well-disposed. My boys were in good
health all the time. I saw Nelly in my dreams on Jan. 20th and talked
with her : on Febr. 1st she seemed to turn back as soon as I saw her.
Although it has not been possible to fix with certainty the day of
Mrs. T.'s visit to Mrs. C., nor the Thursday on which Mrs. T. had
neuralgia, yet it seems clear that knowledge was obtained of Dr. van
Eeden's state of health at the time in some supernormal manner.
(4) The next sitting was on April 19th, 1900, J. G. Piddington
present alone. In the course of it Nelly, independently of any hint
from J. G. P., said :
"Dr. van Eeden and I were talking last night. I couldn't make him
understand. He wasn't like asking me to talk like the time before, but he
knew I was there. He's going to have a sort of breakdown in his health
before August."
J. G. P. " How can you foretell that ?"
Nelly. " I see a picture of him in his bed—wanting nourishment. He's
prostrated, unfit for work. He's doing some writing, and he shouldn't
go on with it. That's what I tried to say to him in the bed last
night."
XLIT.] Account of Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 115
Dr. van Eeden writes :
Walden, April 25 [1900].
I do not remember any remarkable dream about Nelly since February.
But what she has said seems to have a meaning, considering the following
facts.
At the end of March I got an attack of influenza and was obliged, for the
second time this year, to stay a day in bed. Being accustomed to work in
the fields every day, I took up that work again very soon in rather cold
weather. This brought me down again, with fever, pain in the muscles, etc.
I gave up labour for a few days until I seemed to be strong again and began
auew, but again with the same result. This has occurred thrice until I
resolved to stop manual labour for a fortnight. All this corresponds pretty
accurately with what Nelly has been saying. On April 19, however, I ^C-as
all right again, and I have been doing my usual work without hindrance
since that time. I think there is no reason to see a prediction in her state
ments, as they correspond so exactly with the facts which occurred shortly
before the seance.

A RECORD OF TWO SITTINGS WITH MRS. THOMPSON.
BY J. 0. WILSON.
Communicated by J. G. PIDDINGTON.
[IN presenting a pseudonymous paper to the Society I am breaking
through a salutary rule. I should therefore state that the gentleman
who is here called Mr. J. 0. Wilson wrote the paper at my special
request. It seems to me far better for the actual sitter, if a careful
and intelligent observer and thoroughly conversant with the problems
involved, to record his own impressions of the phenomena than for a
third person to intervene with his opinion of matters with which be
is only indirectly concerned. Mr. Wilson was an admirable sitter,
cautious and discrete, yet sympathetic. Nelly hit off one of his charac
teristic traits with her usual bluntness : "This gentleman would tell
the truth, he'd own to everything"; in other words, Mr. Wilson,
though of a critical disposition, yet exhibited none of the reluctance,
which is, I fear, not uncommon with sceptics, to admit the correctness
or the approximate correctness of statements made by the medium in
trance.
Mr. Wilson's reasons for concealing his identity appear to me satis
factory. They have been dictated solely by his anxiety to avoid
causing pain to some members of the family of the lady who is the
chief subject of the communications, and not by any personal objection
to publicity. I am responsible both for the detailed record of the
sittings and also for the notes on the evidence embodied in the record ;
but the facts given in the notes were supplied to me by Mr. Wilson
either verbally or in writing, and have in every case received his
approval.
The omissions, which are shown thus . . . , relate in every instance
to matters unconnected with Mr. Wilson.

XLIV.] Record of Two Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 11T
SITTING I.
January 18th, 1900, 5 p.m.; at 87 Sloane Street, London, S.W. Present:
J. 0. Wilson, J. G. Piddingtou, Mrs. Thompson.
R.=Right. W. = Wrong.
D. = Doubtful or unrecognised.
(Before trance J. O. W. speaks of reporting sermons and shows knowledge
of Mr. F. W. H. Myers. Mrs. Thompson aware that J. G. P. has noted
mention of sermon reporting.)
Nelly. " I don't like mother to use that (crystal) ball. I'm not nervous."
(J. G. P. gives a lady's stocking to Mrs. T.)
"Has he got the square envelope with the mark on it ?"
[Not recognised ; but see further references to envelope below.]
"There's a sore throat about this. [W.] Let that gentleman come and sit
there by me. There isn't a dead influence about this."
[Incorrect, and perhaps some slight indication given by J. O. W.'»
manner that the information was wrong.]
"Yes—wait a minute. . . . This gentleman (i.e. J. O. W.) would tell you
the truth—he'd own to everything."
[True and characteristic, I should say.—Note In/ J. G. P.]
"The feeling is of live influence. Please tell me if it is of a dead influence."
(J. G. P. says "Dead" on receiving intimation from J. O. W.)
"I can see a girl with hair down her back, darker than mother's but not
black, not pushed back, but a cutting over the forehead like a fringe."
[This is a very good description of a girl cousin of the deceased lady,
who is in these records called Miss Clegg, and who died at the age of 24.]
"She (i.e. Miss Clegg) seems to be taking charge of a little boy, a tiny
brother or baby who died a long time ago." [See below.] "The baby looks
up to her not as to a mother, but as if to an elder sister. There is some
one very clever at drawing : and this girl (the cousin) is always so interested
in drawings : she seems to go and watch some one drawing."
[This seems to refer to a man—an intimate friend both of J. O. W.
and of Miss Clegg's family—who can draw cleverly, and is fond of
amusing children by impromptu illustrations of fairy tales, etc. The
girl-cousin was especially interested in watching him draw.]
" Is it too ordinary to say blue dress with white braid on ? Sort of sailor
drew."
[All this fits well for the deceased lady's cousin, who at the time was
wearing a kind of sailor dress trimmed with white braid.]
"Oh, dear ! something like something coming. There is something in an
envelope I ought to have belonging to the lady. The girl in blue and the
lady connected with the stocking are not the same person."
[Throughout the sitting, with perhaps one slight exception, Nelly kept
the " lady of the stocking "—Miss Clegg—and the " girl in blue," who is
assumed to be her cousin, quite distinct. The " girl " was at the time of
118 J. 0. Wilson and J. G. Piddington. [PART
the sitting staying with Miss Clegg's family, with whom J. O. W.
himself was just then residing. The "girl" and the "lady" were
devoted cousins.]
"I've got it in my head that this stocking has been round somebody's
throat." [Nothing known of this.]
"There's an envelope—long in shape—with stamped monogram or some
thing on the back. It's got G. at the back." [The lady is not known to have
used envelopes stamped with a G., but G. is the initial letter of her Christian
name.] "There's a rather old-fashioned bookcase with glass doors." [R.]
" The envelope is there." [The envelopes would have been kept in the book
case.] " This (i.e. the stocking) has been taken off the lady before she died.
[R.] It hasn't a laundry association [R.]—but was taken off when the lady
was not very ill" [" When she was not ill at all " would be correct.] " There
was an old lady with white hair in the room when the stocking was taken
off—not quite white hair, but streaked." [Probably wrong.] "There is a
chest of drawers in the room with a white cover on. Old-fashioned cover—
do you call it Marcella? White, with a pattern all over and a looped
fringe."
[All references to the bookcase are good ; description quite accurate.
The room opens into a bath-room—in the bath-room is a chest of drawers
with a white fringed cover. This room where the bookcase stands is
perhaps the most intimate association that could have been named.]
"She wore a twisted brooch. It was like as if it formed a name or
figures."
(A glove is given to Mrs. T., who keeps stocking.)
J. O. P. " Can you see the name or figures ? "
Nelly. "It's like Gertrude. No, it isn't Gertrude. Gertrude was a very
great friend of the blue dress girl."
[The lady had a brooch of decorative scroll-work, but none forming a
name or figures. But a sister of Miss Clegg states that the description
immediately suggested to her this brooch, and that at first sight the
scroll work looks like a name. The lady's name was Gertrude, though
Nelly does not say so, but merely says, " Gertrude was a very great
friend of the blue dress girl," which was true.]
" The blue dress girl is a person of great importance. The lady was taking
charge of her."
[Both these statements are somewhat indefinite. If " of great import
ance " means " in the life of the lady," it would be more or less true,
though perhaps somewhat overstated. The lady could not be said to
have taken formal charge of the girl, though the statement has some
significance.]
" I associate this glove with a sailor dress, and with the house where the
funny bookcase is. [R,] The bookcase nearly comes to the top of the house
—I mean, of the room. It's like old-fashioned mahogany, red coloured.
[Quite correct.]
XLIV.] Record of Two Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 119
"There is some trouble about an examination with the girl in the blue
dress."
[J. O. W. had been going over work with the girl for an approaching
examination, and he writes that the girl was also " very anxious " about
an examination which her brother was going in for in a few months'
time.]
" You wouldn't think the girl delicate, as she is full of vitality and of a
happy disposition | K. |. and proud of a chain round her neck that she wore.
She didn't look like a ' die-y ' girl."
[This seems to suggest a momentary confusion in Nelly's mind between
the "girl" and the " lady."]
"The chain is like stones, and had something hanging on it."
[J. O. W. did not recognise this with certainty at seance, but wrote
later : " Yes, such a chain was given her at Christmas. She has hung a
silver brooch from it in rather an odd-looking way."]
" I don't know if this gentleman's name is Smith, but it seems written over
him, and associated with him."
[A vague remark, but J. O. W. had been visiting a medium recently
in the company of a Mr. Smith.]
(Mrs. T. holds J. O. W.'s hand.) ."The blue girl is a relation of the
other lady." [R.—cousin.] " The girl with the blue dress came home with
a lot of examination papers [true of three months later] and broke some
thing, and there was a fuss about it. [W.] The lady's brother wears
glasses. [R.] He is alive. [R.] She has got a Margaret—belonging to
that lady." [B.—a cousin, as intimate as a sister would be, who used to
live with her.]
" You mustn't be sad in your heart. You've got a much greater trouble
ahead of you than you think." [Not true so far.] "You don't look very
married in your heart. [R.] Strange heart this gentleman has to get into.
It's divided (i.e. probably the bookcase, not the heart) into portions, and
there's a long paper in the bookcase 1 1 '. |, and if I can't find the lady's name
you'll find it all there." [Quite intelligible.]
" She was an oW-fashioned young lady—retiring, unassuming, not fashion
able." [Fairly good description.]
"There's a feeling of illness as if stocking had been taken off dead person."
[This is wrong, and is in contradiction to what was said earlier. Cf. below
similar contradiction about bicycle.] " Not a laundry sort of feeling. [R.]
It hasn't been washed. [R.] There was a bicycle with gold marks on the
rim associated with that lady." [Quite accurate, but cf. p. 125.]
" That long paper. You pull it (i.e. probably ' the drawer ') out, and then
find a long one." [R.]
"It doesn't matter about all those books. Do you (i.e. J. O. W.) write
with a quill pen ? because I see a quill pen there." [J. O. W. does not use a
quill pen, but the lady did.]
" Those books would just suit old , they are about all kinds of dull and
dirty old things."
120 J. 0. Wilson and J. G. Piddington. [PART
[This statement seems to refer to the bookcase so often mentioned, in
which is contained the family library,—which might fairly be described
as " heavy reading,"—not the books generally read in the household.]
J. (jl. P. " Can you describe and give title of one particular book 1 "
Nelly. "The third one from the end on the left hand side bottom of the
row is a red one. Can't read the title, it's inside."
[The third book in bottom row was covered with brown paper, and
had the title written outside. It was a French dictionary, with green
back and red sides.]
"In that room there's one of those chairs that makes a noise when you sit
down on it : an old creaky chair." [A very definite and apt reference.]
" She has got a dead baby with her."
[J. O. W. was doubtful of this at first, having forgotten that the lady
had two sisters who died, one as quite a baby.]
" I've got one of mother's dead babies at our house. Mother doesn't think
it was a little live boy—but it was."
Trance breaks.
(Mrs. T. re-entranced after an unusually short interval, while J. O. W.
and J. G. P. were out of the room. On entering they found Nelly
chattering volubly to nobody.)
" Something about Emma that belonged to the lady—or Emily." [Lady
had an Auiit Emma.]
" Give that ring to me." (Mrs. T. might have overheard whispered con
versation between J. O. W. and J. G. P.—the former having proposed to
hand a ring to the medium. This conversation took place before Mrs. T.
was first entranced.)
" She came here and said, ' Please ask him to give you my ring,' but didn't
call him Henry." [J. O. W. was wearing a ring which had belonged to the
lady. The mention of the name Henry is meaningless.]
" This lady doesn't belong to town at all : she used to live right away in
the country."
[Her home was in London, but during the greater part of her engage
ment, and before, when at school, she lived in the country.]
" She has got a little satchel with an outside pocket. It's not like mother's
—not a bag—your sister gave it as a present to the lady." [The lady had a
little satchel of the kind described, but had bought it herself.] " I want the
ring—it has got pimples in it."
[Stones are set into the gold of the ring which J. O. W. was wearing,
which do give it a rather 'pimply' appearance.]
"It's like mother's ring, that she lost : just like that. That bag is there
now—it's in existence." [R.—J. O. W.'s notes give " You've got it," which
was true of the satchel.]
J. O. P. "Ask the lady for a message."
Nelly. "About Worthing?"
J. G. P. " What about Worthing '( "
XLIV.] Record of Two Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 121
Nelly. "She had a friend at Worthing, when they had typhoid fever
there." [W.] " She used to wear a deep fur cape, not long but rather short.
He (i.e. J. O. W.) had something to do with buying it : not a mantle, but
short."
[The lady had no such cape, and J. O. W. never had anything to do
with buying one.]
"Gold and twisted brooch—twisted like a Staffordshire knot—a quantity
of S's, and a little stone in the middle."
[J. O. W.'s comment at the time was : " Perhaps right, but I think
not." Later, a sister of the deceased lady thought this was a reference
to the scroll-work brooch already mentioned, which, however, contained
no stone.]
" If that lady had lived a bit longer, she would have been better off in
money." [A certain definite, though quite small, sum of money would
undoubtedly have come to Miss Clegg on her marriage, which was to have
taken place a few months after the actual date of her death.]
" When you're at our house, you're not sorry that you've left your loved
ones. It's not selfish."
(Trance breaks at 6.25. Nelly promises to return in eight minutes.
Trance resumed after a shorter interval than usual. J. G. P. absent.
Nelly asks for something long and black.)
" You won't mind me saying that there is a dead baby in connection with
this stocking." [See above.]
" Some one named Dorothy associated with that lady " [a very intimate
consiu] " not an old person [R.] more like Dolly " [not called Dolly].
"That lady sends her darling sweetest best love." [Phrase not character
istic.]
" You know that lady says that you have of hers a broad silver brace
let." [B.]
(J. G. P. returns) . . .
" I like this gentleman (i.e. J. O. W.) very much,—it's veiy important.
Common names occur. This lady is asking about Jane. Where's Jane ?
Where's Jane ? Who is Jane ? Ask her." [Jane has no meaning.]
" She (i.e. evidently ' the lady ') says, ' what made me ask about shawl was
because when ill I did have a shawl, though not a black one, round my
shoulders ; it was a grey one.i She said it isn't black, you must guess its
colour." [W.]
" Take care of this for Dorothy." [Dorothy died before the lady.]
"There's an old customer come along now. He used to wear an
Inverness coat—father, or grandfather rather, of lady—great difficulty in
breathing, though not fat. He had a boot-jack—was rather irritable
he'd bang that boot-jack down. He is with that lady now. He has got
a Samuel."
[This old gentleman is a reminiscence from another series of sittings.
There is no connection between the old gentleman and J. O. W. or Miss
122 /, 0. Wilson and J. G. Piddington. [PART
" It seems as if this ring was put away somewhere—not direct like that
stocking—in a box with some fluffy wool before that gentleman wore it."
[It was sent to the jewellers' after the lady's death, but was only away
a few days, and had since been worn by J. O. W.]
"She wasn't a lady of great jewelry [R.], but had ear-rings like little
bee-hives. [W.] She has gone away now. I see these things like a
panorama. Katie knows a lot more about her than I do." (" Katie knows "
said very indignantly.)
[The only association with the name Katie is a young servant, who
was always treated as a friend of the family, and is alive.]
" Mrs. Cartwright is coming to talk to me. Mrs. Cartwright has nearly
got wings ;—that's what they say here ; that's a proverb, a saying at our
house. (To J. O. W.) You tell them to take all those furs out of the
drawers : otherwise the moths will get at them. Flip it on the table, and
the feathers will fall out. [W.] She's worrying over that detail."
"Mr. Myers is feeling rather cross—I don't know why. Something
rather upset him—he's ruffled. He seems as if he had come here. Tell him
he has got his feathers ruffled." (6.50 p.m.)
[Mr. Myers wrote, "rather good, . . . but coincidence not close."
J. G. P. knew at the time that F. W. H. M. might be feeling annoyed.
See below.]
(References here followed to Mrs. Benson and to Dr. Van Eedeu, which
are recorded elsewhere.)
(To J. O. W.) " Look for that letter with G. at the back. I'm not sure
it's a G. at the back. It's like a round O. It is like a G. Katie knew all
about family ; she could tell you much better."
[Katie did not know "all about the family," but necessarily must
have known a good deal.]
End of sitting.
SITTING II.
January 25th, 1900, 5 p.m. ; at 87 Sloane Street, London, S.W. Present :
J. O. Wilson, J. G. Piddingtou, Mr* Thompson.
[Before trance Mrs. Thompson said that Nelly had told her that " the lady
from the time before (obviously referring to ' the lady ' of the sitting held on
January 18th) had wanted to show her (i.e. Nelly) varicose veins on her left
leg, and that this was the reason of her very hurried departure at the close
of Mrs. Benson's second sitting on January 23rd, 1900."]
Nelly. " You're talking philosophy. Where is Ben 1 There's a Ben
belonging to the stocking lady with the bad leg." [R.—Intimate friend of
family.] " It wasn't a long black shawl : it was a stocking. I waut that
letter—not the stocking. It wasn't only her leg, but varicose veins as well
under her thigh." [W.]
XLIV.] Record of Two Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 123
"It was true about the bracelet, wasn't it ?"
/. 0. W. " Yea."
Nelly. " Because you didn't know it was true last time." [W.]
(A slip of paper containing rough notes of small expenditure?, written
by Miss Clegg, was then handed to Mrs. T.)
" A peritonitis feeling about this letter. [W.] It's like Auntie A 's
peritonitis—that sort of pain—toothache in your inside." [Auntie A. is a
deceased sister of Mrs. Thompson.]
"Bound books of music belonging to this lady." [W.]
(To J. O. W.) "You're untidy, but the was very tidy—always putting
tidy after somebody."
[J. O. W. writes: "Just the reverse true." J. G. P. notes: "But
this is more a matter of opinion than of fact."]
(To J. G. P.) " I know what Mr. Myers had his feathers ruffled for. It
was your fault. It was because of something you wrote."
["True,"—Note by F. W. H. M See above.]
" It doesn't seem to help me on much, this letter. I want that lady to
come and talk to me. Does it matter if her mother comes as well?" [The
lady's mother is living.]
" She has got an old lady named Annie with her." [D.]
"I'm very undecided about this (sotto voce). It's very strange. This
had been inside the pocket of fur cloak with fur inside." [W.]
(At this point or shortly before a purse had been handed to the
medium, but the notes do not record the fact.)
"Yon know shoes with cloth material tops and leather soles. She used
to wear these in the house, the lady of the purse—the peritonitis lady.
That's the association with the influence of the purse. [R.] The money
used to be emptied out and the purse given to some one else to put money
in. The purse not always belonging to one person." [Vague, but perhaps
right.]
" I can see that gentleman going by Richmond, looking out of the train.
A sort of Ealing feeling. He has to walk along a road that's not paved
nor curbed. It's a made road—with lamps in it—but unfinished—not a
new road." [Miss Clegg's home was in a suburb, which is reached by the
Richmond or Ealing trains. J. O. W. had often visited Miss Clegg
there, and was staying there at the time of these sittings. The
description of the road is quite accurate, except that it is not "un
finished."]
"This—the purse—was under the pillow when the lady was ill in bed.
[W.] You know those glass things that shake—lustres ; some of those—
they are downstairs in the lady's house—immediately underneath the room
where the bed was where the lady was ill." [D. She died in a stranger's
house.]
"This lady has got an umbrella with white handle. It's a straight—
like ivory—handle. [W.] She's not near enough to talk to. It's rather
a strain.n

" She isn't a lady who takes notice when I tell her I'm talking. She was
rather in one groove, and did not like thinking in a different way."
[Characteristic of lady—but Nelly's account hardly tallies with the
lady's alleged anxiety to inform her about the varicose veins. But see
note by J. G. P. at end of paper.]
" Why isn't there any glass in that wardrobe in the lady's bedroom i
It's like a big flat cupboard without glass in. [ I;. ] I'm not sure if the
old lady's name is .Annie or Anna—but I think Anna. [W.] There was
somebody the old lady used to call Peggy—no, Patty—but her real name
was Martha."
[Right—and given without hesitation. No indication of dissent made
by J. O. W. when the name came out first as Peggy. Martha was the
real name of an aunt.]
"The old lady used to keep a tin box of special biscuits, to give to
people." [D.]
" That lady of the purse used to work on canvas, cross-stitch ; there's a
cushion worked by her now in existence; cross-stitch— wool-work —in
blocks—in pieces—in colours—different coloured blocks."
[J. O. W. did not find this was right till March, 1901. There is a
cushion worked in cross-stitch by the lady now in existence.]
"That man has got colours all round him like paint pots. So his name
has got something to do with colours." [The lady painted ; J. O. W.
did not.]
" Have you got that mother-of-pearl—like tortoiseshell—cardcase ? The
one I mean pulls off—it hasn't got a hinge. I don't want the one with
a hinge." [W.]
(J. O. W. hands a small leather cardcase to Mrs. T.)
" No ; that's not the one. It pulls off like that (making a very charac
teristic upward movement with one hand, while seemingly holding in the
other hand the lower portion of an imaginary cardcase)—it's hard." [W.]
" I couldn't find the lady anywhere. I could only find a brother of this
gentleman who died when he was quite a tiny microbe baby." [JR.]
" What does financial crash mean ? Some one belonging to this has had a
financial crash." [There were pecuniary losses, but not a " crash."] " It's a
brother or relation like that of thia lady. He was a gentleman who wore
pince-nez."
[The father lost money. That he wore pince-nez J. O. W. did not
discover till March, 1901.]
"Uncle Philip wants something. An old gentleman—old gouty gentle
man, rather fond of curiosities, had a lot of coins." [W.—Perhaps a con
fusion with some other sitting.]
" You seem to have a lot of old-fashioned furniture at your house. [R]
That old bureau with those bright handles. [R.] The stocking lady's
ashamed about her leg."
J. O. P. " Perhaps she'll come, if I go away." (J. G. P. leaves room.)
Nelly. " Will you come and talk secrets ? Perhaps the lady will come in

a minute. Do you know I put my hand over my eyes. She couldn't bear' it
on her eyes."
(When saying this the medium looked up at the electric light over
her head.) [The lady suffered slightly from weakness of the eyes.]
" Where's mother's handkerchief ? "
(Mrs. T. takes J. O. W.'s hand, and Nelly asks for purse instead of
cardcase.)
" This—the purse—was always being used, and the cardcase only occasion
ally." [R.—but rather obvious.]
" I told you about Dorothy. Dorothy was a little girl this lady used to
sew for. Used to have sleeves tied up, not like mother's."
[ Dorothy, three or four years younger than the lady, was an invalid,
and was companioned for some time by Miss Clegg, who also did sewing
for her at times. Dorothy was a child, and would have sometimes had
her sleeves tied up.]
" The lady had not fat hands, but long and thin and white." [W.] " She
used to have her hair divided in the middle and not pushed back." [R.]
" She didn't seem to me to ride a bicycle, though everybody does."
[Wrong, and this wrong statement is all the more curious, as in the
first sitting Nelly had given correct details of a bicycle belonging to the
lady (see p. 119), and furthermore, the lady's death was due to a bicycle
accident. In spite of these contradictory statements the reference to a
bicycle in connection with Miss Clegg must be accorded considerable
weight, because a bicycle accident caused Miss Clegg's death, and this
is the only mention of a bicycle in all the sittings (about 30) recorded by
J. G. P. ; also in 19 sittings recorded by Mrs. Verrall, a bicycle has been
mentioned once only and a tricycle once only, both references being
definite and correct. This shows that Nelly does not use bicycles as bait

STATEMENT BY J. 0. WILSON.
[This statement was originally written 0n March 16th, 1901, and revised
and enlarged September 28th, 1901.]
I have never met Mrs. Thompson before, between, or after the two
sittings of January 18th and January 25th, 1900; and on these occa
sions we had the very slightest afternoon-tea conversations before she
went into a trance. I am very clear that she could have learnt nothing
about me from anything said in her presence by Mr. Piddington or
myself beyond the two details mentioned in the notes above that I
had sometimes made reports of sermons for newspapers and that I
knew Mr. Myers. But Mr. Myers knew nothing of the circumstances
with which the sittings were concerned, beyond the bare fact of the
death of the lady who is here called Miss Clegg. With the general
outline of the circumstances it will be seen that Nelly showed no
acquaintance.
Absolutely no one except Mr. Piddington and myself knew when my
sittings with Mrs. Thompson were to be, though a sister of mine living
in the country, who had had previously some sittings with Mrs.
Thompson, had suggested my seeing her, and knew that a sitting was
to be arranged for me.i The sister and brother with whom I am
living in London knew I was seeing something of Mr. Piddington,
but had no thought of my taking any personal interest in psychical
matters.
In connection with the possibility of Mrs. Thompson's having in her
own conscious person obtained the information given, one or two
i Mrs; Thompson was unaware of the relationship between us, and has never
heard my name.
XLIV.] Record of Two Sittings with Mrs. Thompson* 12D
further points may be noted at once : (1) As shown above, she could
scarcely have obtained this except through Mr. Piddington, and he
knew very little indeed of my personal life. We had then been
acquainted for a short time only; I doubt if we had actually met
as many as five times. He was not even at all accurately acquainted
with my reasons for wishing to have a sitting, being under the
impression that I had recently lost a wife and was left with several
children. Whereas I have never been married, but was engaged at
the time of her death to Miss Clegg, who was killed in a bicycle
accident in the summer of 1899, and with whom Nelly was supposed
to be in communication. Mr. Piddington had never heard this
lady's Christian or surname. (2) If, however, Mrs. Thompson had,
in her own person, obtained any knowledge of me, Nelly certainly
made no use of it. She gave no information about me and showed
scarcely any interest in me, but confined her remarks entirely to
Miss Clegg. The one fact mentioned about me—that a brother of
mine had died as a baby — is common to many people, and as it
occurred before I was born, is not likely to have been elicited by
ordinary investigation.
On the other hand, she gave the right Christian name for Miss Clegg,
and had no idea of mine. She gave a very close and correct indication
of where Miss Clegg lived, and showed no knowledge of my home.
Almost all the other persons correctly named were friends of Miss
Clegg's, and only associated with me through her.
Yet, on the supposition of fraud, Mrs. Thompson could only have
obtained information about Miss Clegg, of whom Mr. Piddington and
Mr. Myers knew nothing, through what she might have been able to
find out about me. Had she done so, it would have been almost
inevitable that she should endeavour to make her statements about the
dead more convincing by the parade of more startling knowledge of the
living. It would have been easy, and natural, to try to obtain my
confidence in the " communications " from Miss Clegg by making it
clear that she had experienced no difficulty in " discovering " me.
I have no desire whatever to bring forward these points as an
argument that the facts given by Mrs. Thompson are more likely to
have come from direct communication with a " spirit " than from
telepathic insight into my consciousness. There seems to me little or
nothing in these sittings that adds to the evidence for communication
from the dead, and indeed certain details, which I shall mention later,
tend rather to suggest that Mrs. Thompson's impressions were actually
guided by my thoughts and interests at the time of the sittings.
130 « J. 0. Wilson and J. G. Piddington. [PART
I am here only concerned to bring out my general impression that
Mrs. Thompson's statements do not show any of the kind of knowledge
which might have been most naturally and easily obtained through in
genious " fishing " or deliberate fraud. This consideration affords much
stronger evidence in support of her "genuineness " than my saying that
she could not havefound out this or that fact. I am led to the same
conclusion by noticing that while the information given about Miss
Clegg was largely concerned with intimate details particularly signifi
cant to me, it left entirely untouched the striking manner of her death
and the most obvious facts about her everyday life. These must have
been the first discoveries of any fraudulent investigations, and Mrs.
Thompson could hardly have failed to make use of any such knowledge,
if only for the purpose of convincing me at once that Nelly was speaking
of the right lady. On the supposition that the information had been
obtained by fraud, it is sufficiently correct to prove that Mrs. Thompson
had rightly conjectured Miss Clegg's identity ; while it would have been
impossible for her to have found out (through ordinary channels) so
much without discovering more, and inconceivable that she should
not have used such information—to give me confidence.
It is now more than a year since these two sittings took place, but
the perfectly definite impressions produced on my mind by them are as
clear to-day as they were then, and have been confirmed by three
recent examinations of Mr. Piddington's notes.
I have carefully gone over the notes again by myself, with Mr.
Piddington, and with one of Miss Clegg's sisters. There is no doubt
about which of the statements made by Nelly are true and which are
false, and on this matter the authority of Miss Clegg's sister entirely
supports my own conclusions, while it enables me to be positive in the
few details about which I was uncertain. This lady did not see the
notes or know anything of the sittings until March, 1901. She now
feels with me that the number and character of the facts correctly
stated are very remarkable.
The first impression I carried away from my sittings with Mrs.
Thompson was of her clear and unhesitating manner. She never
brought out the first syllable of a name under her breath in order to
feel her way towards its completion. Nearly every sentence was spoken
continuously, so that the fact or idea to be conveyed was seen to have
been in her mind before she began to speak, and was not in any way
"fished" for. I should say that on the whole she gave a stronger impres
sion of definiteness, both in true and false statements, than can be con
veyed by Mr. Piddington's literal and most exact report. A series of
XLIV.] Record of Two Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 131
detached statements may easily look more vague on paper than they
sound in conversation, and they may suggest (what would be quite
untrue of these instances) that more was said or done than is herein
reported. Mr. Piddington has clearly indicated the few occasions on
which he thought it wise to direct—or divert—Nelly's attention, or
when he answered her questions ; and I am sure that he never did so
in any other case. He has also noted everything I did or said myself
which could have influenced Mrs. Thompson, the fact being that
I scarcely spoke at all. There were several instances in which the
temptation was very strong to lead Nelly on by asking questions, or
suggesting that she should pursue a hint, but 1 saw that my doing so
would largely destroy the evidential value of anything she might say,
and I rigidly maintained the silence which Mr. Piddington had enjoined
on me. He was himself so seldom aware at the time of whether
Nelly's statements were true or false that he could not have given her
much assistance.
Mrs. Thompson, both in her own person and when speaking for
Nelly, struck me as singularly sincere ; and while I have already noticed
the absence of the slightest attempt at "fishing" in her trance-talk, it
may be well to add further that when in a normal condition she made
no attempt whatever to " draw " me, directly or indirectly. She made
on me the impression of scarcely giving me any personal attention
except what was required by the ordinary courtesies of conversation,
talked very little at all, and for the most part on her own affairs. To
do this was to miss an obvious opportunity for fraud, if fraud were
designed, as any sitter in my circumstances would have been in a
somewhat strained mental condition and, if led into conversation of
any significance, whether personal or theoretic, would almost infallibly
have betrayed himself unconsciously. By practically leaving me alone,
Mrs. Thompson provided an undesigned and effective witness to her
sincerity. It seemed to me, again, perfectly obvious that she was
genuinely quite unaware of what Nelly had told us. On such a point
it is, of course, almost impossible to produce evidence, but the extreme
simplicity and easiness of Mrs. Thompson's transitions from trance to
wakefulness unquestionably produce a strong impression of absolute
truthfulness.
The information given was undoubtedly all familiar to Miss Clegg
during her life-time, except the remarkablefftatement about money in
the post-office. It was also known to a few other persons now living,
e.g. her mother and sisters. Most of it was immediately recognisable
as true or false by myself, but there are two facts which I did not
132 J. 0. Wilson and J. 0. Piddington. [PART
consciously know at the time, and which I am not aware of having
ever known: namely, (1) that Miss Clegg had worked a cushion in
cross-stitch, which still existed; and (2) that her father wore pince-nez.
It is, of course, just possible that these facts had once been mentioned
to me, and that they had remained in my sub-conscious memory ; but
I am fairly certain that I never knew the second fact,—that Mr. Clegg
used to wear pince-nez. He died before I ever met Miss Clegg or had
even heard her name, and it is not shown in the photographs of him
with which I am familiar.
The names and facts given were in the main particularly associated
with my own relationship towards Miss Clegg, though certainly not, in
every case, those I should first think of in connection with her. A
very intimate girl cousin named Dorothy, for instance, is mentioned,
who died before I knew the family ; but I am familiar with her picture,
and my brother is married to her (Dorothy's) sister. The Mar
garet also mentioned is the third sister in Dorothy's family, and an
intimate friend of mine. The room which figures so conspicuously in
Nelly's visions is one which had only become Miss Clegg's since 1898,
and had earlier associations with quite other members of her family.
No events of her life before my knowledge of her are alluded to, and
no friends of her childhood, except her father and the Dorothy afore
said.
Indeed much of the information dealt directly with matters on
which my mind had been busy during the months since her death. I
was living at that time at her mother's house, and using as my own the
room with " the funny bookcase " and the creaking chair. I had been
having a good deal of trouble about the small sum of money left in the
post-office at her death. The " girl in a blue dress," who was a younger
cousin (not in the same family as Margaret and Dorothy), was also
staying with Miss Clegg's mother at the time, and was always a great
favourite with me.
It is important to say in connection with "the girl in the blue
dress," that Mr. Piddington and myself are perfectly clear that
Nelly never confused her with Miss Clegg, to whom she referred
as "the lady," or "the lady with the stocking," etc. It is not
quite possible to convey this impression by a literal report of Nelly's
words, but we were never in any doubt as to which of the two she
was speaking of, and we could always see that she kept the two
clearly apart in her own mind. She was apparently aware of the
danger to be avoided, and once stated emphatically that the two
were not the same.
XLIV.] Record of Two Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 13-3
I may add, perhaps, a few words about the articles belonging to Miss
Clegg, which were handed to Mrs. Thompson. The stocking had not
been washed since it was worn by Miss Clegg, though it had been put
away for the wash a few days before her death when she was in per
fectly good health. I had myself carefully preserved it in this
condition with a view to possible sittings.
The purse had been constantly used by Miss Clegg, and was in her
pocket at the time of the accident from which she died.
The slip of paper was taken from a drawer in the book-case con
taining diaries, account books, etc., and had written on it rough notes
of small expenditures.
The ring was Miss Clegg's engagement ring. As I have myself
always worn this since her death in addition to my own engagement ring,
it would have been easy for Mrs. Thompson to notice my having two,
and she might have observed that one of them looked like a lady's ring.
This might possibly have suggested to her that I had been engaged,
but not married.
Note by J. G. Piddington on three incorrect statements made by Nelly
about Miss Clegg.
(Sitting of January 18th, 1900.) "She wasn't a lady of great
jewelry, but had ear-rings like little bee-hives."
(Sitting of January 25th, 1900.) "It wasn't only her leg, but
varicose veins as well under her thigh."
" A peritonitis feeling about this letter. It's like Auntie A-'s
peritonitis—that sort of pain—toothache in your inside." (See also the
note which precedes record of sitting of January 25th, 1900.)
The foregoing paper and record were read at a meeting of the Society
held on November 29th, 1901, at which Mrs. Thompson was present.
Assuming that Mrs. Thompson has no recollection of what she says
when in trance, this was her first opportunity of acquainting herself
with the subject matter of Mr. Wilson's sittings.
On November 30th, Mrs. Thompson wrote to me as follows :
Mr. Piddington,
How Nelly does mix things ! My sister died eight years ago of peri
tonitis. . . . She had a gold brooch and ear-rings exactly as Nelly described,
and (with the aid of a magnifying glass) you will see in the enclosed photo.
the identical brooch and ear-rings. When a girl at home she suffered with
varicose veins, but I do not know if she had suffered in that way before her
death, as I did not see her for several vears.
334 J. 0. Wilson and J. G. Piddington. [PART
The ear-rings convinced me Nelly must mean my sister, as never before or
since have I seen any of that particular pattern. In the photograph the
little " bee-hive " does not show very well, but it was formed of a very fine
twisted gold wire.
Yours sincerely,
ROSALIE THOMPSON.
At an interview on December 3rd, 1901, Mrs. Thompson gave me
the following additional.information, viz. :
Her sister, Mary Alethea Turner, died of peritonitis, in the month of
October, 1893, at Handsworth, eight or nine days after childbirth.
She possessed little jewelry, but had and often wore a brooch and ear
rings, on each of which was a design, worked in twisted gold wire, re
sembling a bee-hive, and she was in the habit of referring to these
ornaments as " my bee-hives." Another sister, Annie Wade Middleton,
unmarried, also died of peritonitis at the age of twenty-two, on March
21st, 1894, five months after Mrs. Turner's death. Both sisters had
been attended by Dr. Foster, of Handsworth, both died in the same
house, and both were buried in the same grave in old Handsworth
churchyard.
Some of the facts here mentioned have no immediate bearing on the
three points in question, but Mrs. Thompson readily consented, at my
request, to give such details, in order to facilitate the verification of her
statements.
I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Benjamin Davies, an Associate
of the Society, residing in Edgbaston, for a full and careful corrobora-
tion of such of Mrs. Thompson's written and verbal statements as
relate to the illnesses and deaths of her sisters. In the certificate of
death of Mrs. Turner, of which Mr. Davies has sent me a duly certified
copy, the cause of death is given as "Childbirth, 13 days, Phlebitis, 7
days, Peritonitis, 3 days."
In the certificate of death of Miss Annie Wade Middleton (of which
I have also received a certified copy) the cause of death is given as
" Peritonitis. Haematemisis." With regard to the varicose veins, Mr.
B. Davies -writes :
Finding that this disease was not mentioned in either of the certificates of
death, I went to interview the doctor who attended the sisters, viz., Dr.
Foster, of Hall Road, Handsworth. Dr. Foster, being himself a student of
psychical phenomena, took a particular interest in the inquiry directly I
mentioned the purpose of my visit, and very kindly offered all possible
assistance.
Dr. Foster, speaking from memory, was quite certain concerning the
varicose veins, saying that they certainly did not exist in either case. Dr.
XLIV.] Record of Two Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 135
Foster is of opinion, however, that the phlebitis in Mrs. Turner's case
might quite easily have led the medium to describe the disease as "vari
cose veins."
On December 5th, 1901, I received the following letter from Mrs.
Thompson, who had written to her sister, Mrs. Eudge, with reference
to the varicose veins :
December 4th, 1901.
Enclosed you will find my sister Harriet's letter (Mrs. Rudge's) in reply to-
my question if she knew anything of Pollie's (Mrs. Turner's) varicose veins.
I also asked Mrs. Rudge if she knew where the " bee-hive brooch and ear
rings" were, and also if Mrs. Turner had any other ear-rings.
You will find a full reply to my questions.
I can honestly state I never knew of the " thigh veins," or of any at all
after my sister's (Mrs. Turner's) marriage. ... I have cut away from my
sister's letter the part not bearing upon the subject.
Mrs. Rudge's letter was as follows :
51 C— Road, R— Park, Dec. 4, 1901.
My dear Rosa,
I fear I shall not be able to give you very much information, for my
memory is, and always was, so bad. I never seemed at home much with
Pollie [i.e. Mrs. Turner], and so never heard her say anything about veins in
her single days. But after marriage she had them, and on the inside of her
thigh, I know, just before G was born, she suffered a good deal with
them. . . .
Now as regards brooch and ear-rings, I do not know for certain, but I
believe A has them. I believe some one said they saw her with them
on—feel almost sure. I never knew her with any others except plain ones,,
those you wear first when the ears are pierced. . . .
Your affectionate Sister,
HARRIETT.
It appears then that Mrs. Rudge does not corroborate, though she
does not contradict, Mrs. Thompson's recollection that Mrs. Turner
suffered from varicose veins before her marriage. Mrs. Rudge admits
that her memory is not very clear, aud her statement that Mrs. Turner
had varicose veins after marriage must not be taken as conclusive, for
it is plain that her one definite recollection is of Mrs. Turner's condition
shortly before the birth of her child, when the symptoms were perhaps
not due to varicose veins but to phlebitis. But I see no reason for
doubting Mrs. Thompson's statement that her sister, Mrs. Turner,
did suffer from varicose veins, as this complaint, she tells me, is common
to other members of her family, and some support is independently
afforded to her statement by the fact that persons who suffer from
136 J. 0. Wilson and J. G. Piddington. [PART
varicose veins are somewhat more liable to phlebitis than the generality
of people.
I have examined, under a magnifying glass, the two photographs of
Mrs. Turner, in one of which she is shown wearing the brooch and ear
rings, and in the other the brooch only. I cannot categorically state
that the ornamentation does represent a bee-hive, but it certainly re
sembles one closely. A jeweller to whom I submitted the photographs
is of the same opinion, and was quite certain that the design was, as
Mrs. Thompson stated, worked in gold wire.
In face of this fresh evidence, I think it cannot reasonably be doubted
that the three statements (bee-hive ear-rings, varicose veins, and peri
tonitis) wrongly given by Mrs. Thompson in trance in connection with
Miss Clegg, owe their origin to reminiscences of Mrs. Thompson's dead
sister, Mrs. Turner, which "Nelly" got hold of, but used in a wrong
relation. But because the source of Nelly's information has thus been
traced, the problem presented is none the less puzzling,—indeed, if
anything, the puzzle is all the greater.
I fail to see how any hypothesis involving conscious fraud on Mrs.
Thompson's part can provide a solution.
If we regard Nelly as merely a secondary personality and invoke
telepathy from some living mind as an explanation, we must assume
that this secondary consciousness, while cognisant of the personality
of the sister Annie and of the fact that this sister suffered from
peritonitis, can only discover certain definite facts which would have
been true of the other sister, Mrs. Turner, but cannot assign
these facts to the right person, although that person is the
medium's own sister; and moreover associates them wrongly with
another person, between whom and Mrs. Turner there is no connec
tion whatever.
If, however, Nelly is the spirit of Mrs. Thompson's daughter, then,—
unless her powers of communication happen to have been obstructed at
this particular point by some fortuitous defect in the " machine,"—we
must assume that her knowledge is limited in a curious manner :—
that she knows her Aunt Annie, but does not know her aunt Mrs.
Turner, nor recognise her when she sees her, although the two photo
graphs which I have seen show that a strong family likeness existed
between Nelly's mother, Mrs. Thompson, and Mrs. Turner. But some
light is perhaps thrown on this point by information furnished me by
Mrs. Thompson in a letter dated December 23rd, 1901, in which she
states that whereas " Aunt Annie " was a constant visitor at her
house and often helped to attend Nelly during her illness, Mrs. Turner
XLIV.] Record of Two Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 137
never saw Nelly, and there had been but rare intercourse between herself
and Mrs. Turner for some years before the latter's death.
On December 3rd, 1901, I went carefully through the record of Mr.
Wilson's sittings with Mrs. Thompson, but she did not discover any
other references which could be applied correctly to her sister, Mrs.
Turner.
In conclusion, I may remark that there was and is no connection of
any kind between Miss Clegg or Mr. Wilson and Mrs. Thompson or
her sisters or family.

REPORT ON SIX SITTINGS WITH MRS. THOMPSON.
BY RICHARD HODGSON, LLD.
I ATTENDED six sittings with Mrs. Thompson in July and August,
1900, and quote here the detailed records of these, so far as they
concern myself or the lady present at the first two sittings.
Pseudonyms have been substituted for the real names in the case
of this lady and the most important incidents connected with her.
The portions omitted concern Mr. Myers, or other previous sitters, and
I learned from Mr. Myers after the series of sittings was over that none
of these references to other matters could be regarded as having
any evidential value. Mrs. Thompson knew who I was, and I had
interchanged a few words with her on at least two previous occasions.
So far as I know, the lady, Mrs. Barker, was unknown to Mrs.
Thompson, and was scarcely known to Mr. Myers. I knew little about
her life and friends myself. She had visited America for the purpose of
having some sittings with Mrs. Piper, and was so anxious to receive
communications from her deceased husband that I arranged with Mr.
Myers for a trial with Mrs. Thompson.
It will, I think, be clear on perusal of the detailed records that
the statements made by Mrs. Thompson concerning myself and my
relatives or friends do not—considering the opportunities which she has
had for obtaining information about me—suggest even prima facie any
proof of supernormal power, and they need no special comment.
The statements relating to Mrs. Barker, however, notwithstanding
the many that were incorrect, do include such correct or partially correct
specific statements that the first conclusion suggesting itself to most
readers would probably be either that some supernormal power was
manifested, or that Mrs. Thompson, or her trance-personality, had
obtained information surreptitiously.
I may say here at once that the view which the consideration of
these six sittings inclined me to take is that Mrs. Thompson exhibited
no supernormal power at all during their occurrence, and that she was
xr.iv.] Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 139
in a normal state the whole time. Mrs. Barker, at the time of her
sittings, independently reached and still holds the same conclusion as
myself. In the detailed records, of course, I made notes under the
headings of "trance," etc., in accordance with what the manifestations
purported to be, and the reader can form his own judgment of the
apparently incriminating circumstances from the notes appended to
the sittings in connection with some further comments and analysis
which I give here on some of the most important statements concerning
Mrs. Barker. My own view of the methods which I suppose were
adopted by Mrs. Thompson in acquiring and using information con
cerning the sitter will be sufficiently indicated by the few following
points :
(1) From the preliminary conversation at Sitting I. Mrs. Thompson
obtained the information that " three years ago or so " the sitter was
desirous of having sittings. At beginning of Sitting II. Mrs. Thompson
says : "Things are so difficult after three or four years."
(2) Mrs. Thompson guesses (wrong) that a cap has been brought, and
on the production of the spectacle case guesses (wrong) that it belonged
to the sitter's father.
(3) Mrs. Barker and myself leave the room, and Mr. Myers remains.
After a short time Mr. Myers left the room to call Mrs. Barker.
I should explain here that the sittings were held in what I may
call Koom 2 of the S.P.R. Rooms at 19 Buckingham Street, to dis
tinguish it from Room 1, the Library Room, usually occupied by
Mr. Bennett. The sitter and myself on this occasion, after leaving Mr.
Myers with Mrs. Thompson, went into the general hall space outside
the rooms of the S.P.R. altogether.
I suppose that during Mr. Myers' absence Mrs. Thompson looked
into Mrs. Barker's opened parcel, and read the address or part of the
address on at least one of the envelopes lying there, and thus obtained
the name " Miss Dorothy Gibson."
(4) Mrs. Thompson gives the name Dorothy for the sitter, who
acknowledges it, and then guesses (wrong) that the sitter wishes to
hear from her mother. 'See (2). Mrs. Thompson then guesses (partially
right) "man, his hand used to shake," and (wrong) that he was "ill a
long time." Mrs. Thompson now knows definitely from her several
guesses and from Mrs. Barker's treatment of them that the desired
communicator is not the sitter's father or mother, and is a man, and
she guesses (wrong) that the desired communicator was named Gibson
(probably a guess at the sitter's brother).
(5) I return, and Mrs. Thompson expressly refers to the sitter as
K
140 Dr. Richard Hodgson. [PART
" Miss Gibson." She was, however, married nearly eight years before,
and the letters taken to the sitting had been written to her before
her marriage.
(6) Mrs. Thompson indirectly asks for letters, and, as letters are
being given to her, asks that they should he wrapped up, as though to
suggest that the furthest thing possible from her mind was the thought
of reading anything on the envelopes. The sitter wrapped them so
thoroughly that it would have been at least difficult for Mrs. Thompson
to look inside the envelopes without drawing the special attention of
the sitter to her manipulation of the package. After a short intervnl
Mrs. Thompson requested me to arrange the letters so that her
fingers could touch the writing. This, of course, in itself was a
reasonable request, but it also gave opportunities for Mrs. Thompson
to look in the envelopes or even to take the letters out, as she took
up such a position that the articles she handled both at this and
at later sittings were concealed from my view by the desk. The
notes of the sittings are inadequate as regards the articles handled by
Mrs. Thompson later on ; I believe that on the resumption of the
trance the articles used before were again given to Mrs. Thompson.
When Mrs. Barker was alone with Mrs. Thompson she took my position
at the desk to make notes. It is perhaps immaterial just exactly
when Mrs. Thompson may have looked into the envelopes. My
impression at the time of the sittings was that she probably took
the opportunity after my leaving the room in the second part of the
sitting. In any case I suppose that Mrs. Thompson did look insiile
the envelopes and read the following passages :
"I shall not forget the waiting-room at Altringham for a long
time."
"Your Sodjer, Harold," and other words suggesting an accepted
proposal.
" 1 am glad you did not come up to town with us yesterday. I
drove to Waterloo, and had to take my uniform case."
" P.S. The girls sent a letter to me the other day in a parcel from
home, addressed H. R. Guthrie, Esq. ! ! ! "
As I found by personal inspection, these passages could be easily
read without removing the letters from their envelopes. The signa
ture at the end of one of the letters, which might also have been
similarly read, was an H. B. joined together.
(7) The relation between the above passages and various statements
made later by Mrs. Thompson indicate very strongly that she was
drawing inferences and guessing—making also some interesting mistakes
XLIV.] Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 141
—on the basis of the information acquired from looking inside the
letters.
" You wished him good-bye when he was going on a boat—he went
on a boat."
" He wants to know what his sisters—the two girls—are doing."
" Poor Harold is dead now."
"This dead Harold was a soldier." (S. "Was he?") "You have
seen him in uniform ; why do you say ' was he ' 1 " (S. " Ask him to
tell me some more about his being a soldier.")
The remarks here of the sitter apparently suggested to Mrs. Thompson
that perhaps the references to " sodger " and " uniform," which she had
read in the letter, might not after all mean that the person concerned
was a soldier. Accordingly, in the next sitting (July 31), she says,
"That was no soldier," and in the fifth sitting (August 13) she apparently
guesses that the uniform was connected with a yacht. Later on again,
in the sixth sitting (August 14), she goes back to the "soldier."
But perhaps the most important passages bearing on the question of
whether the letters were read or not are the following :
" He wants to know if you remember the romantic place where he
proposed to you." (S. " Ask him where it was.") " He says it was
in the station waiting-room you promised to be Mrs. Guthrie."
*'No one else proposed to you at Altringham in the waiting-room."
It seems fairly clear from these that Mrs. Thompson inferred from
the statements read in the letters that the name of the communicator
•desired was Guthrie, and that he had proposed at a station waiting-
room ; not unreasonable inferences for a normal intelligence who had
read the passages quoted above from the letters and was otherwise
unaware of the facts of the case,—but nevertheless wrong. (See the
notes appended to the record of the first sitting, p. 148.)
(8) At the next sitting a handkerchief was presented with the name
Barker on it, and the only new information of special significance
given in connection with this sitting was the name Barker.
(9) I need not lengthen this introduction by entering into further
•details concerning obvious inferences and guesses and mistakes. For
example, at the end of the first sitting :
(S. "Ask him one more thing. Does he really mean that he
proposed in a real waiting-room ? ")
"No, no. He says you promised him in the waiting-room."
The point of the sitter's question was missed, as was plain from
the answer then, and also from the statement at the sixth sitting
(August 14).
142 Dr. Richard Hodgson. [PART
" It was at the station when she said, Yes, I will."
It was really at a " dining room " of Mrs. Barker's then residence
where the proposal was made and accepted.
(10) On the other hand there was not the slightest perception at the
first sitting, on the part of Mrs. Thompson, that Mrs. Barker was a
married lady. Mrs. Barker was dressed in ordinary mourning, not in
widow's weeds, and was very young-looking. She was nevertheless
wearing a specially heavy wedding-ring, and I suppose that Mrs.
Thompson regarded this as a deceptive ruse. It was not till Sitting IV.
that any explicit mention was made of Mrs. Barker as a married lady;
and I feel bound to say that in preliminary conversation with Mrs.
Thompson, at the beginning of this Sitting IV., the lady was, in a
moment of forgetfulness, spoken of as " Mrs. Barker." In that sitting
later came the words " Dorothy, my wife." That Mrs. Thompson
herself was aware of the inferences concerning lack of supernormal
power that might be drawn from her previous references to " Miss
Gibson" is indicated by her apparent attempt, in Sitting VI., to
explain such references.
" I always call that lady Miss Something. I always call her Miss
Gibson, because you see the old Grandma Gibson always speaks of her
like that. I say the old, because she was grandma,—she wasn't old
when she came to us. You know that old lady ; she's so interested
in a soldier, a man in uniform, and she wants to take care of him for
some one else."
Upon which Mrs. Barker's comment is : " My father's mother died, I
believe, before my birth."
I should add that the letters taken by Mrs. Barker were not taken
with any thought of deceiving Mrs. Thompson, either by the contents
of the letters or the addresses on the envelopes.
My conclusion is that the order of the events, the relative sequence of
the knowledge exhibited by Mrs. Thompson, and the erroneous inferences
from the written words on or in the envelopes, all combine to show that
Mrs. Thompson read the words in question by normal vision. As the
order of opportunity arose for becoming possessed of the information
by ordinary means, Mrs. Thompson obtained it (first, the names on
the envelopes ; next, such contents of the letters as might be easily
read ; last, the name on the handkerchief)—and not till then.
The question then arises whether Mrs. Thompson in her normal
state acquired the information in question surreptitiously, or whether
she was dominated by a secondary personality to whom the surrepti
tious procedures are to be attributed. There may be some who will
XLIV.] Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 143
adopt this latter view. For myself, I saw no reason to suppose, in the
whole course of my six sittings, that Mrs. Thompson was at any time
in any " trance " state of any sort whatever.
The records are nearly verbatim, except for the passages excluded
as having no reference to Mrs. Barker or myself. These are indi
cated by three asterisks. Two asterisks indicate the omission of a few
words that were not caught or recorded at the time they were spoken,
and I believe that these were unimportant. Dots . . . indicate pauses
or breaks in the utterances of Mrs. Thompson ; they do not indicate
omission of any words spoken by her. Most of the commentary notes
were made either immediately after the sittings or within a few days.
Additional notes were made in February, 1 902, in further consultation
with Mrs. Barker, and these are preceded by the letter A. Mrs. Barker
was alive to the importance of recording as fully as possible, and
especially of writing down exactly whatever she herself said. In one or
two cases, when it was impossible to give the exact words, I gave the
substance of the remark or remarks in square brackets. Comments
made after the sittings are also in square brackets, and the remarks of
the sitters at the sitting are in round brackets.

his left hand and look at it, and in this position it would shake through
weakness.]

" He was ill a long time—some months." [About three weeks.]

[I brought some photos in a parcel, not opened, amongst which was one of
a pony which I have some very vague recollection that we called, among
other names, the sheep. A. The pony's name was Daniel or Dan, or a
Hindustani modification of this. Owing to its habits, it was sometimes
upoken of as a cow or a sheep. The query after sheep was absolutely con
temporary, and the present impression of R. H. is that he understood ship.]
"He says you've got heaps of letters of his,—heaps of letters, have you,

[S. brings two letters. R. H. is about to give them to Mrs. T.]
" Wrap them up, wrap them up." [R. H. gives to S., who wraps much

(usually called Bob), both dead ; but S. does not know whether latter was
dead at time of sitting or not.]

"Oh, she can!")
" Yes. You ought to insist upon it. George says so." [Possible reference
to G. P.]
"There comes a little boy too with this [silk wrap], a little boy too." [A
possible reference to my child, but of no importance. A. Not used by child.
S. is uncertain whether her child was a boy or a girl, although the doctor
--'M it was a girl.]
" What's he doing with all those bottles ... all those bottles ? ... He
seems to be doing something with those bottles." [Allusion significant.]
" Where's the baby—the baby ? . . . I want the baby. Poor Mr. Myers.

(S. " He doesn't want to go. He wants to wait.")
" He doesn't help with that baby. Does Kitty know all about it now ?

[True about the ring which I was wearing. My husband died on a
Sunday. A. It was a crested signet ring and plainly a man's ring.]
" Do all the mediums hold this [silk wrap ?] "
(R. H. " Oh, I don't know.")
" It's more than the man's own." [Not sure.]

" Where's his watch ? Dr. Hodgson, you've got his watch. [S. begins to
take her watch off.] . . . Not this one " [i.e. not R. H.'s watch, which was on
the table. S. nods her head affirmatively, and gives the watch she was
wearing. S. thinks that Mrs. C. here remarked "the half hunter." R. H.

" He always had that on—a sort of cuddle coat. He always had it on.

Herbert not. A. The significance of Harry is that a Henry was closely
associated with the wedding.] " You must not be unhappy, etc. He wants
to know what his sisters— the two girls—are doing."
[He was interested in his three sisters. A. One of these was married
before his death. During his lifetime he was anxious about the other two,
as he was one of their trustees, and their money affairs were in a somewhat
unsatisfactory state. He had wished that they should marry or take up
some definite career. But since his death the second one had married and
the third had become a successful hospital nurse.]
(S. "Shall I tell you, Mrs. C. ?")
"No, but he wants to know ... he ... what they are doing ... is

were in parts of India where there was extremely cold weather. A. During

" Why haven't you got it in your locket ? You have some in your locket ;

preceding note S. did not grasp the significance of what Mrs. T. said. It
now seems clear that Mrs. T. intended to advise her to put the hair from
the envelope into her locket. She was wearing a locket at the time, though
it was not visible, which already contained her husband's hair.] He said-
Dorothy, you were my own after all. What does he mean?" (S. "I

" No, no one did.")

the truth, dear." [Vague, but relevant.]
"Yes, you must come and talk with him again."
(S. "Shall I call Mr. Myers?")
[Trance ends about 5.10 p.m.]
Note by Jt. H.
The comments in square brackets concerning the significance or otherwise
of the statements at the sitting were made immediately after Mrs. Thompson's
departure shortly after the trance ended. The comments were made by S.
in conjunction with F. W. H. M., and R. H. The significance of the allusion
to bottles was not told to R. H., who left the room while S. explained it to M.
While we were commenting on the sitting, S. drew attention to the fact that
some of the names mentioned by the control were on the envelopes which
she had been holding, and S. then inspected the letters themselves and found
that the other most specific references made by the control were also in close
relation to words in the letters. We thought it advisable that a special state
ment on these and connected points should be made in a final note.
In the opened parcel left in the room with the medium alone, when M.
went out to cull S., were two letters, one of which was addressed Mist D.
Gibson, the other to Mia Dorothy Gibson. The names Dorothy and Oibton
were mentioned by the control in the next section of the sitting, when S.
was alone with medium.
The unopened parcel of photos was visible on a chair in the corner of the
room.
XLIV.] Sittings with Mrs. Thompson. 149
After S. had been alone with medium for a short time, K. H. was called in,
and during this section of the sitting the control asked for letters, and the
arrangement of these by R. H., at request of control, so that the fingers
might be inserted, also made it possible for the writing to be read to some
extent by normal means without withdrawing the letters from the envelopes.
Later inspection showed that among the words and passages which might be
read without such withdrawal were :
" I shall not forget the waiting-room at Altringham for a long time."
" Your Sodjer, Harold," and other words suggesting an accepted proposal.
" I am glad you did not come up to town with me yesterday. I drove to
Waterloo and had to take my uniform ease."
" P.S.—The girls sent a letter to me the other day in a parcel from home,
addressed H. R. Guthrie, Esq. ! ! ! "
It ia clear that the most important correct statements made by the control
could have been suggested by the above-mentioned contents of the envelopes.
There were also mistakes in connection with some of these points that sug
gest erroneous inferences from a knowledge of these contents.
The name of the communicator was apparently offered as Gibson (not
true). The name of S. is not now " Miss Gibson." Guthrie is the third
Christian name of husband of S., and not his surname. He proposed to S.
in a dining-room which they called " the waiting-room," but the words in
the letter about " the waiting-room at Altringham " referred to a good-bye
actually spoken in the station waiting-room.
The preceding note was diuwu up by me on July 26th from memoranda
made in conjunction with 8. immediately after the sitting. I forwarded it
to S. for consideration, and have now received it back with one or two
further explanations from her, in consequence of which I have made some
slight changes. The above is the revised form.
July 30th, 1900. R. H.
Mrs. B. also writes in a letter received by me July 30th, 1900 : " Also in
the letters my husband said nothing about not being a good letter writer.
/ said it might be inferred he was not from short sentences, etc. As a
matter of fact, he wrote very good amusing letters to people he knew
well, and especially, of course, to me, but disliked writing duty letters
extremelv."
SITTING II. JULY 31sT, 1900.
[At 19 Buckingham Street.] Present : F. W. H. Myers, R. Hodgson, Mrs.
Barker, and Mrs. Thompson.
[R. H. notes. Mrs. T. arrives 10.30 a.m. Mrs. T. said she was in trance
last night between 11 and 12 p.m. S. arrives 10.45 a.m., and goes with
R- H. into Bennett's room with M. R. H. closes door, but almost imme

" Have you brought anything, Mr. Myers ? " (M. " Is that Mrs. Cart-
wright f") "Yes." * * *
[S. gives a shoe and handkerchief. Pause.]
" Things are so difficult after three or four years." [Husband of S. died
nearly four years ago.] * * *
" That was no soldier." [Holding up handkerchief.] (M. " Who was no
soldier?")
" No, that was no soldier." (M. " That handkerchief you mean ? ") " Yea
A man in civilian dress. Yes, he wanted some water." (M. " This man to
whom the handkerchief belonged ? ")
"Yes."
(M. " Is it the same as the shoe man ? ")
" I don't know."
(M. " He wanted water, you mean when he was ill ? ")
" Yes, he asked some one to give him some water."
[A similar statement made through Mrs. Piper, but is unverified.]
" Where's the piece of his wedding coat ; the little piece of his wedding
coat?"
[S. leaves room and returns with piece of cloth.]
[A control of Mrs. T. at previous sitting with M. alone said that this was
his wedding coat, referring to this same piece of cloth. Correct.]
[M. knew after the sitting on July 23 that the piece of cloth was cut
from the wedding coat. After a sitting which he had with Mrs. T. alone
between July 23 and 31, he told me that a "control" had referred to this
piece of cloth (presented on July 23) and had stated that it was taken from
a wedding coat.—H. H. A. It was a piece of silk lining.]
" You know she hardly liked cutting this, but anything, anything, any
thing, to get evidence." [True.] * * *
[Control has pencil, and starts as if to write on table. R. H. gives block-
book. Written :]
"HRR what do you know the the [I] R [?] B . . . [unde.c.]" [My
husband's initials were H. R. G. B.]

"Yes, yes. It was good of you to be patient."
(S. "No matter. I have waited. . . .")
" Waited so many years, you've got patient."
"B . . ." [couldn't catch] "he's trying to write . . . you. . . . The
worst is we read the contents of a letter without getting the message of the
spirit. His uncle is Robert—you know. [I believe true. A. True.] He
said you always used to tease him and say how silly and absurd he was,
but it is more difficult now, he feels, and not as silly and absurd ; you know
he was very sentimental—delightfully sentimental. What had Brownman
to do?"
[Writing:] "B. . . . [undec.] Brown [?] B Bow m an. Richard . . .
H. . . . P." [?] [End of writing.]
(S. "What—Brown man—?")
"Yes, Richard Bowman he knew—he says Richard Bow man. When he
travelled down to Altringham whilst he was there there was a very heavy
storm and he stayed on." [The name Altringham has significance. See
previous sitting, July 23. The rest is irrelevant.]
" Might I hold his ring that he used to wear—it is the one you gave
him." [I never gave him any ring, and he never wore a ring. A. The man's
crested signet-ring that S. was wearing her husband used to carry in his
waistcoat pocket as a seal.]
(S. "Can he tell me anything about that ring J")
" Why does he say you gave it him when you were his ? The one you had
was diamond." [True. He gave me a diamond ring which I was wearing.]
"He says that the girls were very vexed with you for trying to hear
from him. Think it absurd." [Probably true, from what I know of them.]
" What's Horace—Course I don't. . . ." (S. "Horace?") " Yes, belong to
one of the girls ; he always spoke of them as the girls—funny way to speak
of them." [I have a cousin Horace living, but unknown to the girls or my
husband.]
[Writing.] " My crest and yours." [End of writing.]
" What made him cough so—he coughed—yes. [Pause.] Some one put
something on his chest and round his back too, but you had something grey
straight down when you did it—grey dress." [My husband had mustard
plasters over the heart, not put on by me. A. He died of heart failure due
to typhoid fever with pneumonia as a complication, but he did not cough
except the choking cough preceding death. S. thinks that the doctor and
the nurse together put on the mustard plaster. The nurse was wearing a
grey dress with a white apron. S. was wearing a straight down blue
wrapper.]
" Is Bob there now—Is Bob there—who drove to the station. Yes—yes
..." [Writing.] " B. . . ." [Something undec.] [End of writing.] "No,
mustn't say it. . . ."

" Five years ago. . . . Where's that ring . . . some one's lost a ring."
(S. " I took it off. I put it on again.")
" Some one's lost a ring belonging to you."
(S. "No. I don't think so.")
" A little old-fashioned ring, Dr. Hodgson, that's lost." [Looking about
and moving hands as if searching for something. Loss not known.]
[11.55'a.m. Trance ends.]
Note by R. H.
Mrs. T. wakes and says she heard Mr. Myers say, "That's in the peerage."
Complains, after a short interval of conversation, that she feels muddled.
M. suggests that S. and R. H. go out, while [another control] has opportunity
to come, as Mrs. T. feels clear always after [that control]. S. and R, H. go
into other room ; and S. takes the shoe and handkerchief. Some time after
wards, not noted, ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, M. first and shortly
afterwards Mrs. T. come in ; and after a short conversation Mrs. T. leaves.
Soon afterwards we adjourn to the stance room to make notes, and it is found
that the words "Barker is here" are written on a fresh page of the block-
book R. H. had presented for the automatic writing. The words appear to
have been written rapidly, and not in the style of the previous automatic
writing, and must have been written after S. and R. H. left the room. (The
last words written while I was in the room were on p. 7 of the block-book,
and the words " Barker is here " were on p. 8. R. H.) M. did not notice
their being written while he was in the room with Mrs. T. alone, but thinks
that they may have been written during that time. The only other times
apparently at which they could have been written were just after M. left the
room and before Mrs. T. followed him,—or after Mrs. T. said good-day and
before we returned to the seance room.
The name " Barker" was clearly marked on the handkerchief presented by
S., a fact which did not occur to her till after she had given it. R, H.

(M. "What kind of hair?")
" Dark hair,—he looked bronzed altogether, his face and hair looked dark

was dark.] [Quite wrong—noticeably fair would have been right.-—M. B.]
" I saw Barker first when I was awake, and heard ' let go,' and then passed

slipper is not here.]
" Who's his great friend, a man whose name begins with C and only has
four letters / I'll try to give you that on ... I think the things best
without the person."
(M. " Yes, simply the shoe, brought by Dr. Hodgson.")

"Barker is here," and says it was written when the control was present.
R. H. reminds M. of the incident. See sitting of July 31.]

" Don't bring any letters with names in to lead one astray ..."

(R. H. "Is this Mrs. Cartwright ? ") "Yes. I think Mr. Myers told you
to let me have the slipper." (R. H. " Yes.") [Giving shoe in tissue paper.]
" It doesn't matter about being undone, does it ? " (R. H. " No.")
[Apparently taking off tissue paper, but operation not visible to me owing
to position of desk. I found later that the handkerchief was there also.—
R. H.]
"I remember your saying, Mr. Myers, about how could I see, etc. * * *
This is not the same slipper that I had before—it seems different." [It was
the same.—M. B.]
(R. H. " I asked for the same, or rather I simply asked the lady for the
shoe, as you requested. It may be ... ")
" It seems quite a clean one, quite fresh."
(R. H. "Yes? I don't know any more.'') [Pause.]
" I wonder why this makes . . . there's something about this a difficult

the description.] [There was no trouble with his throat.—M. B.]

stated.—M. B.] * * *

calling you Mr. Myers, but I haven't been able to see. * * * "

" What's that woman doing, listening ? " [R. H. goes to door : servant
there says tea ready.] "... listening."
(B. H. " No, it was only tea.")
(R. H. " That stick, Barker ? ")
" It was straight across . . . like a railway signal . . . silver here, silver
there " [pointing and marking].
[He had an ordinary stick, with handle as drawn, possibly one band on
silver.—M. B. A. Mrs. B. possesses the top of the stick. The stick doubt
less had one silver band, but certainly not at either of the two points
indicated by Mrs. T.]
"He could draw very well, you know ; if he could get hold of Rosa's hand,
he could make her draw. Have you ever seen some of those caricatures he's
drawn of the boys ? " (R. H. " No.") " They were very good."
[He did not draw as far as I know. I have never seen him caricature.—
M.B.]
"Strong smell of cigar smoke. I suppose it's those ..." [Sniffing.]
(R. H. "Mine? ") " Yes." (R. H. " Mine, is it ? ") " Yes, you're not smok

enough." [I had been smoking, but finished my cigar about ten minutes
before Mrs. T.'s arrival. On a previous occasion, as known to Mrs. T., I left
an unfinished cigar on the mantelpiece.—R. H.]
"I wish you'd . . . they all want those girls to do something. Can't they
do something and help their mother ? I feel rather cross. They think as
long as their mother has anything, they can have it. They want speaking

look round and bright. Has he got a yacht?" (R. H. "I don't know.")

" No, it's to do with Dr. Hodgson, with you." (R. H. " Yes.")
[Meaning that I understood that control referred to me. Mary has no
significance in this connection.—R. H.]
" You know with this shoe man, I can see him falling from a horse. He
was not very upright, he used to lean a little forward, a little head first, he
was tall and it gave him that appearauce."
[He had never any horse accident of any kind that I know of ; it U
possible that he leant a little forward when riding, as most tall men do,
though he rode well.—M. B. A. Mrs. B. was mistaken in saying this. She
now recalls that he fell from a horse several times, but never received any
injury worth mentioning.]
" Why does Constance always come up with you, always comes up with
you ... four or five times." (R. H. "With me?")
" You've written down about Constance several times with other people.
Constance committed suicide. She came and told you, and you wrote
it down."
[I have no recollection of any Constance.—R. H.] * * *

to be hunting for something that won't come."
(R. H. " Will you have some articles of my own ? ")

always call her Miss Gibson, because you see the old Grandma Gibson always

soldier, a man in uniform, and she wants to take care of him for some one
else. It was at the station when she said, Yes, I will." (R. H. "H'm.")
"Yes." [Pause.]
[My father's mother died, I believe, before my birth. No such incident as
the above implies occurred at a station. See July 23rd.—M. B.]
(R. H. "And the Grandma's interested in him ?")
"Yes, the Grandma Gibson, you know, not the other one. And what's
the name of the old lady that died with the internal complaint, some growth
internally belonging to the old lady ? " [No relevance known.—R. H.] " I
don't call her old lady, because she was wonderfully sprightly.
" Yes, I'll have something of yours, please. There are people that one can
get at, and another one cannot."
[I give bunch of keys from pocket. Pause.]
" Yes, but this belongs to a maw I was to have seen at Mr. Myers's house.
I want to talk about Eleanor." [Pause. It was my own bunch of keys.
Eleanor no significance.—R. H.] * * *
(R. H. "Would you like some more articles of mine ?")
" Yes . . . yes . . . it's rather dark, isn't it ? [Purse given.] What have
you been writing in this for ? " (R. H. " No.") " Oh, it was the purse you
gave me yesterday that was written in."
[No purse given yesterday. Mrs. T. had talked to me about a purse of
her own that was written in.—R. H.]
"The old lady didn't like your coming to England. She'd like you to have
stayed there, but as long as you had to go she'd come with you." [No

"What was that account you were writing down ! putting some figures
down ..." (R. H. " Well . . . ") " This morning—you put down figures
on paper." [Wrote nothing whatever, except numbering the pages of these
sheets.—R. H.]
"Do you remember your baby sister dying long ago?" (R. H. "Yes.")
" Because . . . croup, you know, croup." (R. H. " Yes.") " She had croup
as well . . . she had something like croup for a day or two." [Mentioned in
Part XXI. that little sister died when I was very young. I believe not
croup.—R. H.]
"What a lot of Annies, not -but Annie belonging to your little sister,
your little sister you know." (R. H. " Yes /")

there were not. Mrs. B. allowed me to see portions of the letters in

Mrs. T. could not have culled from the letters are : (1) that my husband
died abroad, (2) travelled by large vessel, (3) the length of time since he
died, (4) the asking for water incident. The ' bottle ' allusion is very poor

that I guve him the ring and that he always wore it, etc."

NOTE ON A POSSIBLY AUTOMATIC INCIDENT OBSERVED
IN THE CASE OF MRS. THOMPSON.
BY ALICE JOHNSON.
IN his Introduction (see above, p. 65) Dr. Lodge has spoken of what
he calls " suspicious circumstances " in Mrs. Thompson's sittings, when
information which there is more or less reason to think was obtained
normally is given out by the " control " as if obtained supernormally.
Supposing that in such cases the source of the information is really
normal, two interpretations are possible : (a) that either the medium
or the " control " deliberately misrepresents the circumstances ; or
(6) that the impressions of the medium are reproduced automatically
by the "control." Dr. Hodgson maintains the former interpretation
of some instances that came under his observation. I give below a
case occurring in my own experience which appeared to me suggestive
of the latter.
The account is written from my notes, made at the time of the
sittings.
At my first sitting, on July 25th, 1899, I had given to Mrs. Thompson
an envelope (A), fastened up, containing (1) a postcard, and (2) a letter
enclosed in a second envelope (B), not fastened. She had aaked to be
allowed to put her finger inside envelope (A), so I haul torn it open, and she
held it for a little while with her finger inside, I watching her meanwhile.
I could not see that she read anything, but I think it possible that she
could have done so without my detecting it. There was no sign, however,
that she did so ; and none of the information given in the inner letter or
postcard was reproduced. She gave the whole back to me, and I brought it
again to my second sitting on the following day just as it was.
At this sitting Mrs. Sidgwick was the only person present besides Mrs.
Thompson and myself. The sitting was chiefly occupied with statements
about an " old lady," whom I identified as an aunt who had died on June
llth, 1899, aged 81. The description of her was fairly correct.
I then took envelope (B) out of envelope (A) and gave it to Mrs. Thomp
son to hold. Envelope (B) was addressed to one of my sisters by a friend,
B. G., who had died on July 2nd, 1899, and it contained a letter from B. G.
to my sister. Mrs. Thompson, holding this letter, made a few rather
XLIV.] Note <m a Possibly Automatic Incident. 163
vague remarks, which were more or less applicable to R G. Then the
trance ended.
Envelope (A), still containing the postcard mentioned above, was lying
on the sofa on which Mrs. Thompson and I were sitting. Without getting
up from the sofa, I began collecting the papers, etc., which I had brought to
the sitting, when suddenly Mrs. Thompson became re-entranced, and said
in a rather excited manner, " Put down, give my love to all at 3 Bristol
Road [assumed address]. That's what the old lady said."
"3 Bristol Road " was B. G.'s address, so that the remark appeared very
significant. Immediately afterwards, however, I saw that it was written at
the top of the postcard inside envelope (A), and could just be seen by
looking towards the open end of the envelope. I can hardly doubt that
Mrs. Thompson caught a glimpse of this—probably quite accidentally—as I
took it up to put it into my handbag. My impression is that she was not
conscious that she had seen it ; and that her subliminal self or " Nelly " re
produced the percept without any idea of its real source, just as she would
probably reproduce any information she acquires through whatever means.
Though " Nelly " often knows that some of her information is directly
derived from Mrs. Thompson, and represents it as so coming, there seems
evidence in other cases (e.g. in the incident of the bee-hive earrings, etc.,
in "Mr. Wilson's" sittings, see above, pp. 133-7), that sometimes it really
comes from Mrs. Thompson, while " Nelly " is under the impression that it
has some other source.
Considering how much general evidence there is that different strata of
consciousness in the same person may remain entirely unaware of each
other's activities ; also that the memories of different personalities may
partially overlap, while certain regions of them remain distinct ;—I see no
difficulty in the supposition that the part played by Mrs. Thompson in the
incident just' described may have been purely automatic,—that she had no
intention either of obtaining information by underhand means, or of repre
senting it as acquired in a manner different from that in which it really was
acquired. Mrs. Sidgwick, who also witnessed the incident, allows me to
say that this statement represents her view of it, as well as mine. Mrs.
Thompson's manner at the moment was, as usual, open and unembarrassed ;
there seemed no attempt at any concealment ; and I had, and have still,
a distinct impression of her entire sincerity in the matter.

NOTES ON THE TRANCE PHENOMENA OF MRS. THOMPSON.
BY MRS. A. W. VERRALL.
MRS. THOMPSON, as is probably known to many of the readers of
this paper, is a highly developed sensitive, a non-professional
medium, who has been for some years under the observation of
Mr. Myers and other members of the S.P.R., and has lent herself
most freely to their suggestions. The opportunities therefore of
observation and experiment have been exceptionally good and
many, and the results obtained correspondingly valuable. I pro
pose in this paper to confine myself to the description and
criticism of such phenomena as I have myself personally observed
in my intercourse with Mrs. Thompson. I shall therefore not
attempt to enumerate or classify all the abnormal occurrences
that have been noted in her case, nor to give an account of her
previous history, or the development of her powers, interesting
as such a history would be. The present notes are only a con
tribution to the history of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs.
Thompson, and supplementary to the records of other observers.
Under these circumstances I do not propose to discuss the
question of fraud on the part of the sensitive ; when I come to
treat in detail of the facts communicated to me, I shall do my
best to state what opportunities there could have been for the
normal acquirement of the knowledge shown, and leave the reader
to judge whether the hypothesis of fraud, conscious or unconscious,
on the part of the medium will explain the facts. At the same
time, I should like to say at the outset of this paper that on no
occasion in my frequent meetings with Mrs. Thompson have I
had the slightest reason to suppose that she has taken any steps
to obtain information about my concerns or those of my friends ;
on the contrary, more than once she appears to have missed obvious
opportunities of acquiring such information. Further, scrupulous
exactitude has been shown by her, in the normal as well as in
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 165
the abnormal condition, in acquainting me with any knowledge
of my affairs of which she has become possessed. Into the question
of how far in the state of trance when her eyes are apparently
shut she is able to see, I shall not enter, as it is simpler to
assume that what she could know she did know. I shall hope to prove
that much of the knowledge shown by her could not have been
obtained by any normal methods hitherto recognised. The hypothesis
of " fraud" seems to me in the case of Mrs. Thompson not only
improbable but inadequate.
The sittings discussed in this paper took place between April, 1899,
and December, 1900. I first made Mrs. Thompson's acquaintance in
January, 1899, when I met her in a friend's house, by arrangement,
and talked to her for some half-hour or so ; my husband was in the
room at the time, but had no conversation with her. I had no other
opportunity of meeting Mrs. Thompson till April, 1899, when I spent
an afternoon and evening with her, also at a friend's house ; and it
was then that I had my first experience of the phenomena of her
trance. On this occasion, the trance occurred in the presence of
several persons, and the greater part of the communications were made
by Mrs. Thompson in writing ; these communications I did not see, as
they referred to matters spoken of in earlier sittings with which I had
no concern. Towards the end of the trance she made some statements
which applied to me. No regular notes were taken of these, but,
immediately on my return, I wrote down from memory what she said
to me, and my recollections were confirmed by Mrs. Thompson's host,
to whom I showed my notes on the next day. This sitting is referred
to in the following observations, but does not form one of the series
which I have analysed fully for statistical purposes.
On all other occasions referred to in this paper, full notes were
taken during the sitting. At my first two sittings in July, 1899, the
notes were taken by Miss Alice Johnson ; at one very short and unex
pected sitting, with my daughter alone, the notes were taken by her.
On the other occasions I was the note-taker ; sometimes I was alone
with the sensitive, but more often there was another person present.
When mine were the only notes taken, I went through the rough
notes carefully with the other sitter before writing them out, but we
seldom found anything to correct ; once, when the other sitter had
also taken notes, I sent my copy to him for comparison, and received
them back with only one small verbal correction. The taking of fairly
full notes is not very difficult ; there are often pauses of considerable
length in the course of the sitting, and the trance personality is always

For the purposes of this paper I have used the notes and
messages as above enumerated with the exception of Nos. 8 and 20,
when I acted strictly as note-taker, and no remarks on my own
concerns were made to me. No. 8 forms part of the series of Dr.
van Eeden's sittings, which he has himself described, and No. 20, a
very short sitting, belongs also to another series. For the statistics
with which this paper deals I have counted all the statements made
in Nos. 2 to 17 inclusive,i (with the exception as above stated of
No. 8,) so far as those statements referred to myself, my daughter
(No. 10), Mr. and Mrs. A. (No. 9), and Miss Jane Harrison (No. 11
and subsequently). I have not included such statements made in
the second and third sittings as obviously referred to Miss Johnson,
but wherever it was uncertain to which of the two persons present,
Miss Johnson and myself, the trance personality was speaking, I have
counted the statements as made to me, so that the percentage of
unidentified statements is probably slightly higher in those two
sittings than in the others.
Before proceeding to the description and classification of the
various statements made to me or in my presence by Mrs. Thompson,
it will be convenient to say a few words as to the manner in which
the information has been conveyed ; I may say briefly that in my
experience information has been conveyed in the following ways :
(A) Directly from Mrs. Thompson, who has transmitted to
me in writing " messages " received by her when I have
not been present ;
(S) Indirectly through Mrs. Thompson, entranced in my
presence. In the trance occasionally statements have been
'These statistics were originally compiled for a paper sent to the Paris
Congress of Psychology in August, 1900, so that the statements in sittings
rabseqnenr to that date have not been included. I have analysed them roughly
and find that their inclusion would not affect the general result.
168 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART
written by Mrs. Thompson with pencil on paper, but
usually the communications have been made by a supposed
personality speaking through Mrs. Thompson. The prin
cipal personalities which have appeared within my observa
tion claim to be :
(a) Nelly, a child of Mrs. Thompson, who died as a baby;
(b) Mrs. Cartwright, a former schoolmistress of Mrs. Thompson ;
(c) A friend of my own, not long dead, whom I shall here
call Mrs. B.
In this paper, without prejudice to the question whether these
personalities have an independent existence or are modifications of
the personality of Mrs. Thompson, I shall distinguish them by using
the names to which claim is made. I may say that they differ
among themselves and from Mrs. Thompson, so that there is
no possibility of a sitter confusing them. I shall say more about
these personalities later on,i and will now pass to the consideration
of the actual statements made by them.
The most obvious classification of the statements made is to
divide them according to the time to which they refer—past, present,
or future. For our purposes, things referring to the past or present,
being generally known or ascertainable, may be separated from
things referring to the future, the truth or falsehood of which is
not known and cannot be immediately ascertained. Proceeding to a
further classification by results, we may have, in the case of state
ments referring to the future, predictions fulfilled (true), not fidfiUtd
•(false), and unfulfilled (not yet tested), besides a fourth class too
vague or too general to be worth noting at all. In the case of
statements referring to the present or the past, we have, if we
classify by results, three possible classes, things true, things false,
things unverified or unidentified. The following table sums up the
above classification : -
I. Predictions :
(A) Fulfilled (true).
(B) Not fulfilled (false).
((7) Unfulfilled (neither true nor false).
(D) Not capable of classification.
i See p. 184.
2 For details of I., see Appendix A; for II. F, Appendix B; for II. 0,
Appendix C ; II. E is dealt with in the paper.
xnv.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 169
II. Statements referring to the present or past :
(E) True.
(F) False.
(G) Unidentified or unverified.i
Instances of nearly all the seven classes have come within my
personal observation. To begin with the predictions, the total
number made in my presence2 is 16, of which 6 come under Class
C, 9 under B, and 1 under A? A list of these predictions is
given in Appendix A. It will be seen that they deal for the most
part with matters of trifling importance and common occurrence.
Under these circumstances, as it is impossible to estimate the value
of the results by comparing them with the ascertained number of
successes and failures in a similar series of random guesses, and as
farther the number of predictions not fulfilled (B) is relatively very
large, I confess that I am not waiting with any particular interest or
anxiety for the results of the predictions hitherto unfulfilled. As
far as my personal impression and experience go, I have had no
reason to believe that Mrs. Thompson, or any of her personalities,
possesses the gift of prophecy.4
If we pass on to the classification of statements referring to the past
or the present, the material is much more abundant and the results,
as it seems to me, very striking. It is difficult to count statements
exactly when they have to be sifted out of miscellaneous conver
sation, but I have gone carefully through the notes of my sittings5
between April, 1889, and June, 1900 (sittings 2 to 7, 9 to 17, in the
list given above), and endeavoured to make a list of actual statements
'I call those statements unidentified which seem to have no connexion with
the sitter or the sitter's concerns ; unverified statements, on the other hand,
are statements that are definitely connected with facts or persons known to
the sitter, but whose accuracy it has not been possible to ascertain.
2 Some predictions concerning me, directly or indirectly, have been made
to other sitters, but the consideration of these does not enter into my scheme,
a> this paper deals only with my personal observations.
'The solitary "fulfilled prediction" concerned the occupation at a specified
hour of the trance personality, and therefore is not strictly speaking a pre
diction in the ordinary sense of the term, but as it is a statement referring
to the future it must be classified under this head.
* I have classed, for statistical purposes, all references to the future as
predictions, but in many cases I think that the statements made were hardly
*o intended. See Appendix A for full list and discussion of details.
'Detailed reports and criticism of some of the sittings will be found in
Appendix D.
170 Mrs. A. W. Verrcdl. [PART
made. When the same thing has been stated more than once, I have
counted it as one statement. Three statements appear twice over,
as there were at first definite false statements of facts, which, with
no suggestion from me, were corrected wholly or partly on subse
quent occasions. The form of correction varied ; once the control
ling personality deliberately referred to her own previous remark, and
put it right; once the fact which had been incorrectly stated by
Nelly was correctly stated by Mrs. Thompson's handwriting in
trance ; once a true statement inconsistent with a previous false one
was correctly given without any reference to the previous version.
Tentative or vague remarks subsequently defined have been counted
in their final form only ; these, I may say, were very few. On
one occasion Nelly made a rambling series of remarks which seemed
at the time hopelessly confused, but the next day Mrs. Cartwright
disentangled and sorted the various observations and these therefore
have been counted as finally stated by her.i
The total number of statements made to me between the dates
mentioned above has been 238 ; of these 64 come under Class G,
unidentified or unverified; 33 under Class F, false; and 141 under
Class E, true. It will thus be seen that the percentage is as follows :
Class E (true), 59.
Class F (false), 14.
Class G (unidentified), 27.
In Appendix B will be found a complete list of the false statements,
and in Appendix C a general description of those that are un
identified;2 here I propose to deal with the correct statements in
detail, and to consider what possible sources of information were
open to Mrs. Thompson.
CLASS E. CORRECT STATEMENTS.
The reader will, I think, be prepared to admit that unless the
statements made were of the most commonplace and vague kind, the
large percentage of correct statements excludes the possibility that the
cause of the success is to be found in accidentally accurate guessing.
Fortune, no doubt, favours the bold, and much must be allowed for a
lucky accident . such a percentage of success as 59 would not warrant
i See p. 179.
2 It should be noted that the general head of unidentified statements includes
remarks totally differing from one another both in nature and in value. See
Appendix C.
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 171
us in assuming a supernormal intelligence on the part of the guesser
were the statements like those of the ordinary " palmist " or the
society fortune teller, such, for instance, as that a "dark lady
acquainted with the sitter " had recently had a " trouble connected
with money," or that the sitter had lost a friend through " an
accident" or by "a violent death." The statements that appear in
my notes are not of this nature ; many of them will be given in
detail later on, but a few specimens taken at random will serve to
show that we are dealing, for the most part, with perfectly definite
statements. I find among my notes the following statements : that
the sitter's husband has two brothers and one sister living ; that
a lawyer called Stephen or Steevens was intimate in a certain
house ; that the sitter had been occupied during the last day or two
in turning over sheets of paper and making corrections upon them ;
that the name of a new sitter introduced during the sensitive's
trance was (let us say) Kitty ; that a letter held by the sensitive
had been kept in three places, viz., a left-hand drawer, the locked-up
cupboard of a writing table, and an old-fashioned writing-desk. I
have made no selection in the above enumeration ; some of the
statements are correct, some incorrect, but the reader will not deny
that they are definite.
Granting then that accident will not account for the success shown
by Mrs. Thompson, let us see whether statistics throw any further
light on the question whether the information undoubtedly possessed
by the sensitive has been acquired normally or by some method
or methods not hitherto generally recognised as available. I may
say that under the head of knowledge normally acquired I should
include not only everything consciously learnt by the sensitive, but
everything that she can have gathered from half-forgotten conversa
tions, from the clever piecing together of clues accidentally given,
from the rapid glance at written words or names that have been
within her range of vision, even from so fraudulent a performance
as the deliberate conveying to her, without her consent or know
ledge, by some other person, of ascertainable information. Thus,
if facts obtainable from the Peerage or Who's Who, or such other
source, were given, not at the first interview with a stranger, but
at a later sitting after an interval during which the sitter's name might
have become known, I have counted such information for my present
purpose as normally acquired, though I must not be understood as
thereby implying my belief that it was so acquired. So that, when
once a person described by the sensitive has been recognised
M
172 Mrs. A. W. Ven-aLl. [PART
and named by the sitter, all such subsequent information about that
person as could be found out by an enquirer counts for my present
purpose as normally obtained knowledge.
Of the 141 correct statements made to me, including the three that
were corrections of previous errors, 51 i were matter that could have
been learnt by normal means and 90 were not. It will thus
be seen that the percentage of correct statements obtainable by
the sensitive from normal sources of knowledge is 36, so that the
non-ascertainable statements constitute 64 per cent., or nearly two-
thirds of the whole number of correct statements.
Thus, after putting aside unverified or vague remarks, incorrect
assertions, and such correct statements as were normally obtainable,
there remains an irreducible minimum of 90 out of the total of 238, or
38 per cent., which are correct and not to be obtained by the sensitive
through any normal recognised means of information. This large
percentage, taken in conjunction with the detailed nature of many
of the assertions, warrants the belief that Mrs. Thompson has some
source of information not generally accessible.
With regard to the nature of that source of information, there does
not yet seem to be sufficient evidence to justify a dogmatic assertion.
The information given, in my experience, varies considerably in dis
tinctness as well as in value, and the general impression left upon me
is that the source is not always the same. Occasionally, for instance,
there seems to be direct telepathy between the communicating
personality and the sitter, while on other occasions such telepathy
is conspicuously absent. I have endeavoured to classify the informa
tion given accprding to its possible sources, and in the account that
follows I have grouped the incidents together according to the class
under which they seem to fall. Some classification is necessary to
guide the reader through what would otherwise be but a hopeless
tangle of isolated facts about a stranger's concerns. It is rather with
the intention of stating than of solving the complex problems arising
i Among the 51 I have reckoned 6 very remarkable statements as to the con
tents of a certain letter which was " psychometrised," as Mrs. Thompson calls
it, for me by Mrs. Cartwright ;—not that I believe the information to have been
normally acquired, but, as the letter was in the same bouse as Mrs. Thompson,
and as Mrs. Thompson was once alone in the house for three-quarters of an hour,
though it is exceedingly unlikely that she had seen the letter, and indeed
impossible that she should have come across it by accident, it is not a physical
impossibility that she should have read it. Her statements therefore, as to its
contents are not counted us due to supernormal knowledge. See pp. 204-7 for
detailed account.
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 173
from the phenomena presented by Mrs. Thompson that I have adopted
the classification which follows.
FACTS NOT ASCERTAINABLE BY THE SENSITIVE.
The correct statements of facts not ascertainable by Mrs. Thompson
Jiave been grouped under four heads :
(a) Things known to the sitter and directly present in his
consciousness ;
(6) Things known to the sitter, but not immediately present in
his consciousness :
(c) Things that have been well known to the sitter, but are at the
moment so far forgotten as only to be recalled by the
statements of the medium ;
(d) Things unknown to the sitter.
Illustrations will make clearer the distinctions between these
-classes : (a) Things known to the sitter and directly present in his
consciousness. Under this head fall all the statements as to articles
brought by the sitter, and all remarks about friends of the sitter
wheu once there has been identification of the person described by
Nelly with an actual acquaintance. Thus I class under this head
Mrs. Thompson's correct statements with regard to a small locket
which I had given her; namely, that it belonged to another lady
who had given it to me, that "at the beginning of it all" was an
old dead lady called Annie or Anna, that the white hair in the
locket belonged to a different dead lady, not Anna. But I do
not put under this head but under the next (6), further correct
statements which she made about the old lady Annie, or about
a ring belonging to the owner of the white hair, as these further
statements, though true, had no sort of connexion with the locket
and were not present in my consciousness at the time. Under
this head (a) comes a very striking allusion (see p. 214) to the
circumstances connected with the death of a certain lady, Mrs. B.,
made by Mrs. Thompson immediately on taking into her hands
a letter from a relative of the lady's ; the letter contained no
reference to Mrs. B.'s death, but had been given to Mrs. Thompson
in the hope of obtaining from her definite information concerning
the lady, known to both the sitter and the note-taker. Descriptions
of objects brought by the sitter, given before the objects have
been seen by the sensitive, come into this class, as do also
instances of apparent direct response on the part of Nelly to a
174 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART
thought in the sitter's mind. Some very clearly marked instances
of this last have fallen within my own observation ; the cases are
not very numerous, but the response from the "control" to what
has been thought but not uttered by me has been so rapid and
complete that, were it not for the evidence of the other sitter, I
should have been disposed to believe that I had unconsciously
uttered the thought aloud.
Thus on one occasion Nelly said that a red-haired girl was-
in my house that day, and I was wondering whether a certain
friend of my daughter's who is often at the house would be there,
when Nelly added, " Not So-and-so," mentioning by name my daughter's
friend, exactly as though I had uttered the passing thought.i Again,,
when Nelly was describing a certain bag given to me for my
birthday, something she said made me for a moment think of a
small leather handbag left in my house by a cousin and occasionally
used by me, and she said : " You had an uncle that died ; it was
not long after that." The father of the cousin whom I had just
thought of is the only uncle I have known, but his death long
preceded the giving to me of the bag as a birthday present, which
was what she had quite correctly been describing till my momentary
thought apparently distracted her attention to the other bag.2 1
have had in all some five or six instances of such apparently direct
responses as the above to a thought in the sitter's mind, but when
at Nelly's suggestion I have fixed my attention on some detail for
the sake of helping her to get it, I have never succeeded in doing,
anything but what she calls "muggling her."
I pass to the next class (b), much more abundantly illustrated in
my experience ; things known to the sitter but not immediately at
the moment present in his consciousness. The greater number of
the correct statements made to me by Nelly come under this head,,
so that to illustrate this class fully would be to give a complete
account of some of my sittings. A single illustration must suffice.
In what was practically my first sitting with Mrs. Thompson—for I
had only been present once before with several other people while
she was entranced—Nelly gave me a series of descriptive touches of
a dead lady with whom I was intimately acquainted, all of which
were true, characteristic, and familiar ; but they were not the leading
traits in this lady's personality, the points on which I should have
seized had I wished to recall her to a third person. Nor was my
attention fixed on this particular friend at the beginning, for I had.
i Sec App. D, p. 231. 2See App. D, p. 242.
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 175
given the sensitive a small hair cross and was expecting informa
tion about its owner. But the statements of Nelly were definite
and accurate, referring to small details of dress,—among other
things saying that my friend wore a black silk apron trimmed with
lace fastened by an elastic and button round the waist, that this
apron had belonged to some one else before her (the lady had
often told me that it was her mother's), and that she folded
it in a particular way ; Nelly also described correctly the
lady's objections to the low-necked frocks which my child wore
as a baby, and imitated a habit she had of pulling up the child's
under-vest to cover her bare neck; she further successfully re
produced a facial trait of this lady, a characteristic movement of
the lips, and finally described her as puzzled at the situation,
doubtful as to the truth of Nelly's statements that I was really
present—all this very characteristic—but engaged in obtaining
explanations of the circumstances from Dr. Arthur Myers. There
was no sort of reason why Mrs. Thompson should associate the lady
in question, had she known her name, with Dr. Myers ; as a fact
they had not met more than three or four times, but on those
occasions my friend had been in the habit of discussing the
problems investigated by the S.P.R. with Dr. Myers, because, as she
used to say, his explanations made the things easier for her
to understand.i
These statements then, it will be seen, were definite and accurate ;
they were characteristic, but they were not present in my mind ;
they were not obvious, nor were they what I should have myself
selected had I wished to recall memories of my dead friend to
another acquaintance. Other and more intimate things than details
of dress and personal habits were in my thoughts as soon as the
characteristic points given by Nelly had made me realise of whom
she was speaking, but to these no allusion was made. Telepathy
there may have been—it is difficult to say where telepathy may
not be—but it cannot be said that direct telepathy from the
immediate consciousness of the sitter can account for all the
statements that come under this second head (b), as might be said
of the statements classed under (a).
The third class (c) contains " things that have been well known
to the sitter, but are at the moment so far forgotten as to be
recalled only by the statements of the medium." It is not always
«asy to draw the line between this class and the preceding one, but
i See App. 1), Sitting 2, p. 223.
176 Mrs. A. W. VerraU. [PART
the distinction is between the things that are not prominent in one's
mind and the things that have altogether passed out of one's
supraliminal consciousness, though the mention of them recalls
them to memory. Under this head (c) comes Nelly's mention
of carpet slippers with foxes' or animals' heads upon them in
connexion with a certain dead Theodore who "belonged" to me.
Only one Theodore " belongs " to me, and such points in the
general description as were given seemed to be appropriate. My
recollections of this Theodore were few, though fairly vivid ; he had
died about five years before the sitting, having lived in Australia
for the last thirty years of his life. I had written to him shortly
before his death, but had had no answer and had not seen him since
I was a child of five or six years old, when I knew him well. At
first I could attach no memory to the slippers with their foxes'
heads, but a recollection came back, was strengthened by time and
confirmed by the remembrances of other members of my family, that
I had worked him some slippers, putting in the ground behind the
foxes' or animals' heads which were on the work when it was
bought. Nelly's definite account of my working the slippers, given
at a later interview, comes under class (a), as I then asked her about
Theodore, with the intention of seeing whether her information
would be more complete now that my recollection was more
definite, but the early reference at my very first interview to
Theodore's slippersi comes under the head of more than half-
forgotten things.2
The next class (d)—things unknown to the sitter—is the most inter
esting, as the information given can hardly be due to telepathy, unless
we are to give to the word a much wider significance than has hitherto
been done. Communication with the mind of the sitter will not
explain the correctness of statements demonstrably unknown to the
sitter's consciousness, and if such statements occur too frequently to
be ascribed to chance, we must seek for their explanation some
other source of information, such as clairvoyance, or communication
in some form with the minds of persons absent and unknown to
i As perhaps throwing some light on the origin of Kelly's information in the
first instance, I (nay say that I have many recollections of Theodore mnch
more vivid than the slippers are, even now after many efforts to recall their
story ; but I think that Theodore can have had very little knowledge about me,
and if pressed to say something of me, would probably have known only two
things—that I was my mother's daughter, and that I had once worked him
some slippers.
8 See App. D on Sitting 2, p. 227.
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson, 177
the sensitive, perhaps even of the dead. It may be said that it
is difficult to demonstrate that any particular fact is and has
always been unknown to a sitter, especially if, while granting the
possibility of telepathy, we further suppose that what is known to
a person's habitual associates may have been communicated to that
person's subliminal self. But for the purposes of my present paper
there is a clearly defined class of things unknown to the sitter, and
this is the class of which I am speaking.
The number of cases of this kind has been small in my experience—
ten in all; and I propose to relate them here in detail,i adding such
information as I have been able to obtain as to the possession by
others than the sitter of the knowledge shown, so that the reader
may judge what is likely to be the sensitive's source of information
in each case. Some of the cases are in themselves trifling, and
would be of little interest if they made part of a long series of
random guesses. But in the rarity of such random guesses, com
paratively trivial or commonplace matters are of interest and
value.
(1) My daughter had received as a birthday present from an
annt during her absence from home a small old-fashioned brooch,
under the following circumstances : 2 she and a cousin had been
offered by the aunt two little trinkets of her own, this brooch and
a ring, and the cousin, being the elder, had been given her choice.
She chose the ring on the ground that she already happened to
own a brooch in other respects exactly like the brooch offered, but
set with red stones instead of blue. I knew of the aunt's gift and of
the fact that the cousin had chosen the ring, but not of her motive
for so doing. I took the brooch to Mrs. Thompson about a
fortnight after my daughter's return home.
Nelly (a) described the brooch without seeing it, and said (I)
that it had belonged to an old lady, and (c) that there was another
similar brooch connected with it. It will be observed that (a) the
appearance of the brooch was known to me, the sitter, that (b) the
fact—correctly stated—of its former ownership was a reasonable
inference for any one who, like me, had seen the brooch, but that (c)
the existence of a similar brooch was unknown to me, but known to
at least three living persons. It was only when I restored the
brooch to my daughter and related what the sensitive had said that
I heard about the existence of the similar brooch, which was in
i The tenth case is too private to be related ; it ia briefly described on p. 196.

178 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART
fact an element of some importance in the story, as it determined
my daughter's ownership of this brooch.
(2) I had shortly before Mrs. Thompson's visit to me in Decem
ber, 1899, marked in a shopman's catalogue a small pendant for
wearing on a watch chain which I intended to give my daughter as
a Christmas present. I had not mentioned my intention to any one,
and the catalogue had been put away with other papers where it
was not accessible. Nelly, in a talk alone with my daughter when
I was out of the house, told her that some one called Margaret—
which is my name—would give her a trinket to wear on her chain
if she asked for it. When I found this statement in the record
made by my daughter of Nelly's sayings, I consulted my daughter
and showed her the marked catalogue; but the present was not given,
as I found she preferred something quite different.
The knowledge thus shown—if it is not to be called a guess, and
it should be noted that no other such guesses were made—was
possessed only by me, who was out of the house when the state
ment was made.
(3) My daughter, who was away from home, had received among
other presents at Christmas a book which I had not seen, though
I had been told its title. I did not know that it was illustrated.
Nelly said to me on January 3, 1900, at Hampstead, in the presence
of another sitter, who knew nothing of my daughter's presents,
that Helen had received a book for a Christmas present with a
picture of a ship in it. This was, as I subsequently found, correct:
there are six pictures in the book, in one of which is a ship, and
this picture is reproduced on the cover.
The knowledge here shown—if it is not reckoned as a guess, and
it should be noted that no other statements were made by Nelly
about Christmas presents—was not possessed by me, the sitter, but
was possessed by my daughter, by the giver of the book, and doubt
less by other persons who had seen the book.
(4) When I gave Mrs. Thompson the locket mentioned above
(p. 173), I believed it to have belonged to my youngest sister, who
had died as a young child in 1866. There had been three exactly
similar lockets, containing my grandmother's hair, given to myself
and my two sisters, and after my little sister's death my mother
carried the locket on her watch chain. After my mother's death in
1894, my sister, hearing that I had lost the hair out of my own
locket, gave me hers, keeping the one that had belonged to my
little sister and my mother. But I had misunderstood her, and
xr.iv.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 179
thought that it was this one that I had, and was taking to Mrs.
Thompson. After saying that the locket was not mine, Nelly gave
a short description of the lady to whom it had belonged, which
was wholly inapplicable to my mother, though appropriate to my
sister. I had consequently reckoned this statement as incorrect, and
it was only on mentioning the matter to my sister that I found
that I had been mistaken, and that Nelly's account of the previous
ownership of the locket was, as far as it went, more accurate than
my own.
The information shown on this occasion was thus not possessed
by me, the only sitter, but was possessed, as far as I know, by
only one other person, my sister, who had never seen Mrs. Thompson,
and was not aware that I was intending to take the locket to her.
(5-9) The next five cases are closely connected, and the informa
tion purports to have been communicated to the sensitive by a dead
relative of the sitter. The history of the way in which these statements
were obtained is worth noting ; it affords a curious illustration of what
I have noticed more than once, namely, the apparent growth or
development of information on the part of the trance personality,
during an interval between two sittings, where there has been no
possibility that the sensitive should have become possessed of further
knowledge by normal means, even if we suppose her willing to obtain
such knowledge surreptitiously. At an interview at my house when
Mr. and Mrs. A. were present, and I was taking notes, Nelly made a
rapid and confused statement, which seemed to Mr. A., sitting
for the first time with Mrs. Thompson, to be wholly unin
telligible. Mrs. A., who had been present at other sittings,
thought that the remarks suggested confusion rather than mere
imagination, but it was impossible to make anything of the
statements as given. Mrs. Thompson was told on coming out of the
trance that the sitting had not been successful, as there was a great
confusion of statements. The next day Mrs. Thompson informed
me that she had had a vision or trance when she was alone,
in which Mrs. Cartwright had appeared, and had said that Nelly
had made a great confusion between Mr. A.'s relatives, and that she
should herself have to come to set things straight. Later on, after
a long and very successful sitting under Nelly's auspices with another
friend of mine, Nelly was replaced by Mrs. Cartwright. At Mrs. Cart-
wright's request, the notes of the previous sitting with Mr. and Mrs. A
were produced and read aloud, sentence by sentence, in the presence of
Mrs. A. but without Mr. A. At each pause Mrs. Cartwright stated
180 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART
whether the remark was true or not, and to whom it referred, so that,
in the end, out of an apparently hopeless tangle a definite series of
statements was obtained from the trance personality, some of them
known by Mrs. A. to be true, some of them entirely unfamiliar to
her. These latter were six in number ; one of them appears to be
wholly incorrect (App. B., No. 18) ; the other five are here related,
Nos. 5 to 9.i
(5) It was stated that Mr. A. had a relative, an old lady, alive, a
"rare old lady for knitting"; that this lady used to carry about with
her around knitting-basket which contained her "top-knot, an ornament
for her head, a cap you might call it, but it was a top-knot." Mrs. A.
was well acquainted with an old relative of Mr. A.'s, who was a great
knitter, but had never seen her with a round knitting basket or any
cap basket, and knew nothing of a " top-knot." Mr. A. could throw
no light on the statement. Mr. A.'s sisters, on hearing the above
account, said that the relative in question, having somewhat thin hair
in middle life, before adopting the old lady's cap, with which Mrs. A.
was familiar, had worn a little knot of black lace on the top of her head
which her young relatives called her top-knot, and which she used to
take about with her in a round knitting-basket.
(6) It was stated that Mr. A.'s mother, now dead, " was familiar with
the wife of a retired naval officer ; you could get information about
this." It was known to Mrs. A. as well as to Mr. A. that his mother
had few intimate or familiar friends, and of these there was only one,
Mrs. C., whose husband's occupation was unknown to Mrs. A., as the
lady was a widow when Mrs. A. first heard of her. Mr. A. supplied
the information that the husband was called Captain C., but thought he
had been in the army. Mr. A.'s sisters, however, said that he had been
a captain in the navy, and had retired from the service before his
marriage. They further said that this lady, the widow of Captain
C., was the only person outside her immediate family group who
had visited their mother during her last illness.
(7) It was stated that Mr. A.'s mother used to wear a "white
Shetland shawl," and that the shawl was still in existence in her
i As Mr. and Mrs. A. do not wish their uame to be printed, I am unable to print
the record of this sitting in App. D. But I hare quoted the actual words of the
sensitive throughout whenever it was possible. The information not already pos
sessed by Mrs. A. was obtained by her from her sisters-in-law, the Miss A.'a,
about three weeks after the sitting, when she read to them my record of the
statements of the sensitive and the comments of Mr. and Mrs. A. The Miss A.'s
do not live in Cambridge, and had not heard of Mrs. Thompson till Mrs. A.
showed them the record.
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 181
husband's house, "still here, not in your house (to Mrs. A.), in the other
house." Neither Mr. A. nor Mrs. A. had any recollection of such a
shawl, and Mrs. A. was sure that she had never seen her mother-in-
law wear a Shetland shawl. But the daughters said that their mother
used to wear a white Shetland shawl as an evening wrap, in their early
childhood, before Mrs. A.'s acquaintance with her, and the shawl is
still in existence in the husband's house. After their mother's death
the shawl, which had special associations for her, had been kept by the
daughters. It may be said that it would be a safe guess to say that a
lady of the age of the lady in question had worn a white Shetland
shawl, but it would not be a very safe guess to go on to say that
such a shawl was still in existence in its late owner's house.
(8) It was stated that the same lady used to fasten the Shetland
shawl with a brooch, and this brooch was described in detail. It was
said to be about the length of a brooch held by Mrs. Thompson at the
moment, but not so high, "more lengthwise, with open work of gold
round it, and plaits of hair behind." Mrs. A. was further told " to
ask the stouter lady " about the brooch. Mrs. A. had no knowledge
of any such brooch; two brooches were known to her, but neither of
them answered to the description. Mr. A. had no recollection of any
of his mother's brooches. The daughters said at once that there was
a brooch corresponding to the description in all respects, except that
there was no hair at the back, the central stone being a topaz set
transparently. The brooch hud been worn by their mother during
their early childhood, and by the elder daughter for a short time some
thirty years ago. Mrs. A. asked what was to be made of the suggestion
that " the stouter lady " should be asked about the brooch, as by the
stouter lady she had supposed the younger and less thin daughter was
meant, who, as so far appeared, had no connexion with it. She then
found that the brooch with other trinkets had actually been in the
charge of the younger daughter, and kept in a drawer in her room
ever since their mother's death. Under these circumstances, Mrs. A.
proceeded "to ask the stouter lady" for the brooch, and the brooch was
fetched from the place where it had been kept undisturbed for six or
seven years. It was found to have at the back a plait of two different
kinds of hair, black and grey. The topaz, which looked transparent,
was, in fact, set upon a coloured foil, and the centre of the brooch was
solid.
(9) It was stated that Mr. A.'s mother, being "a clearing-up,
methodical lady," possessed a manuscript receipt book,i still in
i " She bad things put in a book of receipts."
182 Mrs. A. W. VerraU. [PART
existence in her husband's house, and that in this book were
receipts other than cookery receipts, and in particular a receipt
for pomade, or, as the lady herself used to call it, " pomatum." It
was known to Mrs. A. that her mother-in-law had possessed such a
receipt book as described, but nothing of its contents was known to
her. The existence of the book was not known to Mr. A. The
daughters knew of the book, and said that pomatum was certainly the
word used by their mother for the article in question, but they knew
nothing of any receipt for pomade. The book was fetched ; it had
been written in from both ends and was carefully indexed. No receipt
for pomade appeared in the index, but after the experience of the
brooch, sufficient confidence was felt in the accuracy of Mrs. Thompson's
information to induce a search through the book. It was then found
that the last five receipts, counting from one end, had not been
indexed, and that among these was a receipt for making Dr. Some
body's pomade. The book had never, so far as is known, left the
house where its owner had lived, and Mrs. Thompson had certainly
never entered that house. The receipt was moreover in the middle
part of the book, and, owing to its not having been indexed, was not
very easy to find, even for those who had leisure to search.
With regard to the possession by others than the sensitive of the
knowledge of the facts in these five cases, it will be seen that they have
points of difference and points of resemblance. In all five cases the
information (a) was certainly unknown to one sitter, Mrs. A. ;
(b) was certainly not consciously possessed by the other sitter, Mr.
A.; (c) certainly had been possessed by the dead lady from whom
Nelly represented herself as having obtained it. In cases 5 and 6
it is probable that Mr. A. had at one time or other known the
facts about the top-knot and the profession of Captain C. ; it is
also likely that he had seen the white Shetland shawl (7), though
he certainly did not know that it was still in existence. In
case 8 it is very unlikely that, even if he had as a child seen the
brooch, he knew anything of the plaits of hair at the back, and
he certainly did not know that it was in the keeping of the younger
sister. In the last case, 9, he was not aware of the existence of the
receipt book, and it may be taken as certain that he had never read it.
The greater part of the facts were known to some other living persons,
as must always necessarily be the case if statements made by the
sensitive and unknown to the sitter are to be capable of verification.
These living persons were unknown to Mrs. Thompson and were
themselves unaware that reference had been made to their family or
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 183
friends, so that their thoughts were not directed to reminiscences of
deceased relatives. Moreover, the whole of the facts were not known
to these living and absent persons. The only person who knew all
was the dead lady herself. If such experiences as these were numerous,
it would be difficult to avoid inferring that the source of information
is to be found rather in the one consciousness that knew all the
events than in the scattered consciousnesses which can, after all,
not supply the whole. But more of such experiences would seem
necessary before we are warranted in constructing even a provisional
hypothesis of this sort.
Moreover, while the evidence from this group of cases (5 to 9) seems
to point in the direction of communication from the dead as the
simplest explanation of the knowledge of the sensitive, it must be
remembered that no such source seems indicated by the evidence in
the other group (1 to 4). There the facts, unknown to the sitter,
were in three cases known to another living person not then present,
but familiar with Mrs. Thompson, and interested in the sittings. In
the last case (4) the knowledge was possessed by a stranger to Mrs.
Thompson ; but in none of these cases is there any reason to suppose that
any dead person knew the facts, or was interested in them, nor did Nelly
claim to have become possessed of the information through any other
means than her own. In two of the cases the information concerned
an article held by Mrs. Thompson at the moment, and in the other
two, it concerned the doings of persons known to Nelly, who, it may
be said, claims to be able occasionally to visit people whom she knows.i
The only "person" then in these cases who could obtain the informa
tion given, and supply the common element, is the trance personality
which we call Nelly. Of the question of the independent existence
and interdependence of the various trance personalities I do not
propose to treat in this paper ; my present point is that the knowledge
shown in cases 1 to 4, if it is to be regarded as something more than
accidental, is not analogous to the knowledge shown in cases 5 to 9.
Its explanation, be that what it may, clearly is to be found in the
possession by Mrs. Thompson of some faculty other than that of
obtaining information possessed by a deceased friend of the sitter.
i For other instances of knowledge shown where Nelly claims to have visited the
person in question and " seen " what was being done, see p. 187 foll. But the
analogy is not complete, for in the cases there related, the facts, though not
consciously in the sitter's mind, were known to her, and therefore the hypothesis
of telepathy from the sitter is not, as in the above cases 1-4, excluded.
184 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART
METHODS OF COMMUNICATION.
It having, as I hope, been shown that some, at least, of the statements
made by Mrs. Thompson are such as cannot be due to random guessing
or to information normally acquired, it will now not be out of place to say
something about the methods by which the communications are made,
and more particularly about the so-called personalities that are the main
source of information. The methods employed fall, as has been
already said (see p. 167), into two principal divisions according as the
statements made are, or are not, known consciously to the normal
personality of Mrs. Thompson. Some of the statements made to me
have taken the form of written messages sent to me by Mrs. Thompson,
recording things that she has heard or seen in a state of trance or
ecstasy, and remembered on waking ; but by far the greater number
have been uttered through the lips of Mrs. Thompson—or, on some very
lew occasions, written by her hand—while she was entranced. There
has been very little writing within my observation ; what has been so
written has, with one possible exception, been in the sensitive's own
handwriting. The trance utterances purport to come from some spirit
of the dead, who has for the time taken possession of the medium's
person. I have, as I have said, received communications from three
such personalities, Nelly, Mrs. Cartwright, and a personal friend whom
I have called Mrs. B. The characteristics of the respective personalities
are not very marked ; all bear strong resemblances to that of Mrs.
Thompson herself. The actual voice is hardly to be distinguished
from hers, the words and phrases, so far as they are in any way
distinctive, are such as she herself uses in the normal state; in fact,
regarded as a piece of dramatisation, the performance is not striking.
But, in spite of the absence of distinct traits, there is a marked indi
viduality about each of the three personalities which makes it impossible
to confuse them with one another or with Mrs. Thompson. It is no
more possible to mistake Nelly for Mrs. Thompson, or Mrs. Cartwright
for either, than it is to mistake one living person for another. The
first words of Mrs. Cartwright or Nelly, though preceded by no change
in Mrs. Thompson's manner, attitude, or gestures, show instantly
and unmistakeably who claims to be communicating with the sitter.
The characteristics of Nelly are much more vivid to me than are those
of Mrs. Cartwright, but in both cases the general effect on the sitter is
much what would be produced were they in effect what they purport
to be, in the one case a child of Mrs. Thompson's, in the other a former
schoolmistress. In this respect, in my experience, they differ greatly
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 185
from the so-called Dr. Phinuit, the sole control of Mrs. Piper when I
sat with her. Although the change of voice and manner from Mrs.
Piper to Dr. Phinuit was very much more marked than is the change
from Mrs. Thompson to Nelly, Dr. Phinuit did not produce on me the
impression of an actual independent being with whom it was possible
to enter into normal relations. The two personalities of Nelly and
Mrs. Cartwright, on the contrary, make the same impression as would
two actual human beings with whom one had a normal acquaintance ;
you may like one better than the other, you may know one better
than the other, you may recognise their merits and their limitations,
but it never occurs to you to doubt their independent existence.
The third personality, Mrs. B., cannot be classed with the other
two, as it differs from them in some important respects. Like them,
it is not to be confused with Mrs. Thompson herself, but, unlike
them, it presents so far no unity, no such characteristics as go to the
making of an individual. Not only does it not bear the remotest
likeness to the person it claims to be, but it has at present no
individuality at all. It is something which is not Mrs. Thompson,
which is neither Nelly nor Mrs. Cartwright, which is vague, colour
less, undefined, speaking with difficulty and hesitation, hardly aware
of its surroundings, unable to answer directly the questions of the
sitter, sometimes apparently unconscious of the presence of one of
the sitters, absorbed in the thought of the difficulties and strangeness
of the occupation in which it is engaged. Very definite statements,
quite impossible to obtain by any recognised normal means, have
been made to me and in my presence about Mrs. B., but they have
been made by Nelly, usually after the departure of the personality of
Mrs. B. herself. This personality has now appeared to me four
times, and each time it has made great advances as regards coherence
and power of expression. It is possible that with time some char
acteristics of the lady herself might appear; the name has been given,
the personality is asserted by Nelly to be that of Mrs. B., and its own
statements are throughout consistent with the supposed personality ;
what is at present lacking is just that touch of individuality which
is the distinguishing mark of Nelly and Mrs. Cartwright. The
study of the development of a new personality, whatever be the
explanation of such personalities in the case of Mrs. Thompson, is
by no means the least interesting of the problems presented, but the
material is not yet sufficient to enable me to do more than state the
elements of the problem, and leave its solution for the future.
The question of the relations of the two leading personalities,
186 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PABT
Nelly and Mrs. Cartwright, to each other and to Mrs. Thompson
is a very complicated one ; so far as my ovvji observation goes, I
have not been able to separate into groups the facts known to Mrs.
Cartwright and those known to Nelly. As both these personalities
claim—and seem—to possess the power of learning facts by super
normal means, this is not remarkable; where there is a possibility of
the telepathic transference of knowledge in the sitter's mind (to take one
probable source of information) to the communicating personality, it
would be unreasonable to expect that the range of knowledge possessed
by the two personalities should be widely different. Moreover, the
two personalities claim to be in constant communication with one
another, and Nelly sometimes quotes Mrs. Cartwright as the authority
for a statement made by herself, so that I have found it quite
impossible to distinguish between the things known to these two
controls. But there is no difficulty in drawing such a distinction
between the knowledge of these personalities on the one hand and
that of Mrs. Thompson herself on the other. I do not mean that
nothing is possessed in common by Mrs. Thompson and the trance
personalities ; on the contrary, I am convinced that occasionally facts
that have been learnt by Mrs. Thompson in an ordinary way are
reproduced by the trance personality, often with correct additions
not known to Mrs. Thompson, sometimes with slight errors or con
fusion of detail. A clear illustration of this was obtained at one of
my more recent sittings, the statements in which do not enter into
the statistics quoted at the beginning of this paper.
On September 14th, 1900, during an unusually long wait before
the entrancement of Mrs. Thompson, in the presence of the other
sitter, Miss Harrison, I told Mrs. Thompson in the course of
conversation the following facts :
(1) That during our summer holiday, my daughter had had an attack
of chicken-pox, and that she and I had in consequence moved from
our hotel at Baden to a pension i at Zurich, where we had been shut
up in absolute seclusion for sixteen days in two rooms, with very little
to do, and that we had occupied our leisure in trying the time-
honoured means of divination by means of the " Bible and the key,"
only that the Bible had been replaced in our case by a paper novel.
(2) That once some years ago I had tried Planchette with a
friend, and that we had written correctly the Christian name,
Elizabeth, unknown to both of us, of a lady who was coming to
dinner; that subsequently, with a view to discovering which of the
i The pension was a new one ; I did not mention its name to Mrs. Thompson.
xnv.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 187
two manipulators contributed the more largely to the result, we
had each read different books while sitting with our hands on the
planchette, and that the words written under those circumstances
by our two hands were the French words under my eye.
(3) That I had had great difficulty in inducing a very stupid
postmistress in a small village in the Grisons to despatch a paper
on Mrs. Thompson's trance phenomena which was to be read at the
Paris Congress ; that the woman would recognise no classification
outside letters but " samples " or " printed matter," and that when I
finally induced her to send the MS. by parcel post, she could tell me
nothing of the probable date of delivery of my parcel, had never
heard of Paris, and only knew of France that it was "very far
away."
I transcribe from my notes of a later sitting (Dec. 14, 1900)
remarks of Nelly's which seem to me to refer to the above facts ;
the reader will note that there are one or two slight errors, such
as would be likely to occur if any one were relating after some weeks
a story that had been once heard. But what is much more remark
able than these errors is the addition by Nelly of several details
to the stories—details which she had certainly not learnt from
me, which in some cases had been mentioned by me to no one, but
which were correct. I give the account of the sitting as recorded
by me at the time:
Xotes of a sitting at 19 Buckingham Street on December 14<A, 1900—
Present, Mrs. Thompson and Mrs. Verrall.
XeUy. " Helen had pimples and sat in a dark room ; I saw her there."
Mrs. V. "Can you tell me about it?"
A'elly. "You had a pink blouse and you read to Helen when you had
it on. There were stairs outside the house when Helen had the pimples. I
watched you going to the Post Office ; what a silly old woman ! Shall
I tell you a story?"
Mrs. V. "Yes.""
Selly. "Once upon a time Mrs. Verrall was in Switzerland and she
wauted to send a round Christmas box. The old woman said, 'I don't
know where Paris is, but it is a long way off.' She would not understand
whether the parcel would get before the birthday. You know Professor
Richet, who sent ' mother the book with the pretty pictures in it ? "
Mri. V. "Yes, I know him."
i Mrs. Thompson tells me that Nelly's statement that M. Richet sent her a book with
pictures is not quite correct ; in March, 1900, in his own library, M. Hiohet gave Mrs.
Thompson such a book.
N
188 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART
Nelly. "It was Professor Richet who wanted it to read."
Mrs. V. " Can you see what the old woman wore ? "
Nelly. "She had a thing round her head, like a poker thing sticking
up. I saw you. You know you speak French well, very ; but she did
so worry that one would think you couldn't speak French."
Mrs. V. "Cau you see me in the room with Helen?"
Nelly. " When you opened the window you had to stick a pot hook in.
I saw you sticking it in. It was troublesome."
Mrs. V. "Yes, I had some trouble with that pot hook."
Nelly. "There was a curtain you screwed up and folded so that you
could read."
Mrt. V. " How do you mean ? "
Mrs. Thompson took out her pocket handkerchief and gathered it in
parallel folds on her knee.
Mrs. V. "Where was the curtain?"
Nelly. " There were curtains to the window and the bed ; I can't see
where it was ; the curtain is a separate picture. There was not a comfort
able chair in the room where you sat and read ; I can see you sitting
like this."
Here Mrs. Thompson imitated a person trying in vain to sit comfortably
on an upright chair.
Nelly. "Helen's eyes were bad and you read to her. What funny
steps those were outside the house ! There was a verandah by the Post
Office where the parcels were ; you seemed to pass a verandah not
belonging to the Post Office. Where was the boy's mother? Why did
she not go with you? She might have read to Helen."
Mrs. V. "Can you see the boy?"
Nelly. "He was rather thin, not like Helen."
Then came two or three discui-sive remarks about my daughter and
a friend of mine, one of Mrs. Thompson's sitters, then quite abruptly :
Nelly. "Does Frank know about it?"
Mrs. V. "I don't know who Frank is."
Nelly. " Helen knows Frank. He belongs to people who were in
Switzerland and could speak English ; they thought the postmistress
stupid. What a flat look there is at the back of her head ! It is all
put on in a piece ; does she sleep in it ? "
After some more talk about some one mentioned earlier in the sitting,
Nelly said :
Nelly. " You know the willow pattern plates ? Well, the house where
you stayed when Helen had the pimples was like that, a sort of squaritied
house, not ordinary. The top of the house was like the plates ; like a
serviette doubled into four for 'top-hats.' What made the hook bad was
that the hole was full of rust ; it did make your finger dirty ! It wu
rather a rickety place."
Mrs. V. "Can you see any one in the house?''
Nelly. "There was some one wore a short and round skirt who used to
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 189
go up the steps with a cap like a Dolly Var<len carrying milk on her
shoulders, a thing that went across her shoulders. There were stuffed
birds in the room on the left side of the house where Helen had the
pimples." (She then went through the action of sniffing and said with
great emphasis :) " I did not like the lavatory " (then, as if puzzled), " but
you had Mr. Willgar with you there. What made Helen kiss him ? I
can't fit him in."
Mrt. V. " Can you see any one else ? "
Nelly. "Only the boy, Helen's cousin. I like Helen the best. Mother
likes you the best, but I like Helen. I saw her when she was by herself.
Did you write with a plauchette ? You and Helen had something you
were pretending to write in Switzerland, trying as if with a table."
J/n. V. "Can you see what it was?"
Xelly. " I can see a table with a glass, but that's here " (pointing to
the bottle and glass before us), "that comes in front. It was a key and
a Bible and a string."
Here I told Nelly that I had told her mother this, and she said she
might have got it from her mother's mind. She went on :
Kelly. " I have seen you trying with letters not in Switzerland. I
kuew you before mother knew you. I have always known the people
who were interested in these things. You know Eliza? Have you got
Eliza ? You got the letters and wrote French ; you went like that" (as if
writing), "and wrote French. You asked the lady's name that was coming
to dinner. I was there."
3lrt. V. "Who else was there?"
Netty. "No, I could not see."
It will be instructive to take in detail the three points on which
I had spoken to Mrs. Thompson two months before these remarks
were made by Nelly, and see what errors and what additions were
made in the reproduction of them.
(1) The chicken-pox of my daughter appears, the fact of our
being shut up together and my reading to her (a likely guess),
and the divination with the book and the key. But the book has
become a Bible, which I distinctly said it was not. The additions
were as follows :
(a) That I had a pink blouse, and read to Helen when I had it
on. I had a pink blouse, but did not wear it in Helen's room ; I
had two completely different dresses, worn one in the sick room and
one in my own room, and the pink blouse belonged to my room ;
(b) That there were stairs outside the house ; later these are
described as steps up which the milk woman used to go. The
street outside our house, on to which the window of Helen's room
looked, terminated immediately beyond our front door in a great
190 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART
flight of some sixty stone steps, of the breadth of the carriage road,
which did not extend beyond our house, and all the passers-by went
up and down these steps ;
(c) That when I opened the window I had to stick in a pot hook,
that the pot hook was troublesome, and that the reason was that
the hole was full of rust, and made my finger dirty. The outside
shutters in Helen's room fastened to the wooden upright which made
the centre of the window frame by two pot hooks fitting into iron
rings on the window frame. I was not able to push one of the hooks
into its hole for the first few days and made temporary arrange
ments, but after a great storm of wind had destroyed my substitute,
I had to investigate the cause of the obstruction, and found that
the ring was choked up with rust. In clearing it, I tore the skin of
my finger, and had to wash my hands with some care to get out
the rust which had got into the wound;
(d) That there was a curtain, which I screwed up and folded, so
that I could read. There was no difficulty with the curtains in
Helen's room, but each evening, before sitting down in my own room
to read, I used to fold the curtain back by gathering it into my hand
and tucking it behind the peg at the side ;
(e) That there were curtains to the window and the bed. This
was the case in Helen's room ; it is, of course, very unusual to have
curtains to the bed in a Swiss room, but in this case the curtains had
been put as a protection to the eyes of the patient, and any one
acquainted with the circumstances might probably have guessed that
there would be curtains to the bed ;
(/) That there was not a comfortable chair in the room where I
sat and read. This was true, there were only two hard, narrow up
right chairs, extremely uncomfortable, and I often had to give up
reading to Helen and go to rest in my own room after making many
efforts by a change of position to make myself comfortable ;
(g) That the house top was squarified, like the top of the house in
the willow-pattern plates, or a dinner napkin folded into four. This
is true ; the house, unlike the majority of Zurich houses, stood in its
own grounds ; it was a square house, and on the top of the roof was
a flat space, considerably smaller than the area enclosed by the house
walls, so that the angles of the lines of the roof ran inwards to a
central platform very much as they do in a willow-pattern plate ;
(A) That it was a rickety place. This was not true ; the window
shutters, etc., were particularly well made, and the iron and wood
work good;
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 191
(»') That a person in a cap, carrying milk, used to go up the outside
steps. This is not true ; plenty of women in short round skirts went
up and down the steps, but I have no recollection of any milk carrier,
nor do the women of Zurich wear caps ;
(j) That there were stuffed birds in the room on the left side in
this house. This is not true ; the room on the left was a tiny office
containing little furniture. At the next place, to which we went from
Zurich, where my husband, usually called by Nelly "Mr. Willgar,"
joined us, there was the largest collection of stuffed birds I ever
saw in one room, but the room was not on the left-hand side of
anything. In this same hotel of the stuffed birds there was a shocking
lavatory, the only bad one we found in our three months' absence.
Is it possible that by this time Nelly had passed on to the next
place ? It will be seen that she put my husband with us, and seemed
puzzled how to fit things in.
(2) The old story of my attempts with Planchette appears with the
mistake of Eliza as the name written instead of Elizabeth, with the
reference to the language, French, reproduced by the instrument, and
with the unlikely addition that Nelly was present on the occasion.
It will be noticed that Nelly was not able to say anything of the
friend who joined me in making Planchette write.
(3) The story of my difficulty with the postmistress appears ; the
fact that I had a parcel to send to Paris, and the impossibility of
getting from the woman any account of the time when it would be
delivered. It is an error to imply that the language was French : it
was German ; that the parcel was round : it was flat ; and that it was
going to Professor Richet : I sent the MS. to Dr. Janet, who was to
give it to Mr. Myers to read ; as a fact it was not read, but an
account of its contents was given at the Congress in Mrs. Thompson's
presence by Professor Richet. The following additions to this account
were made by Nelly :
(a) That the woman had a thing round her head, like a poker thing
sticking up : that she had a flat look at the back of her head, and
that the thing was all put on in a piece ; perhaps she slept in it.
The description is not very definite, and it is difficult to say how
far it really represents what as a fact the woman wore, but part of
it does represent my impression at the time. The postmistress wore
a stiff black lace erection which stood out round her head, and which
from a front view I had taken to be the frill of a cap. I distinctly
remember the surprise with which I discovered when she turned
round, that, instead of there being a knot of hair at the back, what I
192 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART
had taken for the frill of a cap was the edge of a sort of plate, clapped
on at the back of the head like a halo, with no knob of hair beyond
it, as I had expected to see. The erection was flush with the
actual back of the head, so that it almost seemed to be part of the
head itself, and the question instantly rose in my mind as to what
she could look like without it;
(b) That on my way to the Post Office I seemed to pass a
verandah not belonging to the Post. This is true ; on my first visit
to the Post to send off my paper to Paris I missed the regular
entrance and went on to what I thought was the house to which I
had been directed. The people there told me that I had passed the
Post, but could go back to it through a verandah which belonged to
them ; this I accordingly did.
I have dwelt at great length on these trivialities because the
observations of Nelly seem to me to be worth studying in detail. I have
no doubt that much of what she said in December was directly derived
from what I had said in September to Mrs. Thompson : but it is
interesting to note that, whether or not we are to allow Nelly's
claim to have "seen" the additions, it seems clear that the personality
that calls itself Nelly has the power of learning facts about the
sitter that have not been communicated nor directly asked for ; it
would almost seem as if Nelly's knowledge were just that of a person
who could see a little better than the rest of us, who had the
faculty of going just outside the normal bounds of knowledge, when
her attention had been directed to a particular point. This, if true,
is very interesting to those, who, like myself, have made experiments
in thought transference, or " clairvoyance," because in success in such
cases the sensation to the guesser is exactly that of having on this
occasion seen or heard a little better than usual. I refer of course
to cases where it is not possible that the real explanation of the
success is to be found in hyperaesthesia.i
To return to the point whence I started, it is clear that the trance
personality does occasionally show knowledge of what is known to
Mrs. Thompson ; in some cases no reference is made in the trance
to the normally acquired knowledge of Mrs. Thompson, but it often
happens that the trance personality quotes Mrs. Thompson as the
source of knowledge, for it claims the power of "reading Mrs.
Thompson's mind."
But so far as long and careful observation enables me to judge,
i See article on "Some Experiments on the Supernormal Acquisition of
Knowledge" in Proceedings S.P.R., vol. XL, p. 174.
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 193
the converse of this proposition is not true ; never once have I
found Mrs. Thompson in her normal state show possession of know
ledge familiar to the trance personality. I have constantly tested
this matter ; I have spoken to Mrs. Thompson as if she knew some
thing that I had discussed with Nelly, but I have never found in
her any trace of such knowledge. If by accident or on purpose I
have addressed the trance personality as though it were identical
with Mrs. Thompson, I have invariably been corrected ; in fact there
can be no doubt to any one who has had frequent opportunities of
observation that the separation between Mrs. Thompson and the
trance personality is a very real thing to them both and goes very
deep. For the purposes of the statistics at the beginning of this
paper it has of course been assumed that all information given through
the ordinary channels to Mrs. Thompson or any of the trance per
sonalities is information normally obtained ; but as a matter of fact
it is my belief that abnormal or supernormal means of information,
such as telepathy, clairvoyance, or other faculties, are quite as readily
employed by the trance personalities as the more normal methods.
FAILURES, OMISSIONS, ETC.
So far I have written only of the positive side of the communi
cations through Mrs. Thompson, but no account of the phenomena
would be complete without some comment on what may be called
the negative side,— the failures, the omissions, the apparent un
importance of the facts told, the lapses, the errors, the want
of continuity and occasional incoherence of the narrative. The full
list of errors in my earlier interviews, as far as I know them, is given
in Appendix A. Probably to this list should be added some of the state
ments about persons long dead, or otherwise unverified, but the total
number of actual misstatements is not in any case large (see p. 170).
The omissions and the incompleteness of statement are much more
remarkable, and the apparent failure of Nelly to draw obvious
inferences is one of the most marked and interesting features
within my experience. In illustration of this the reader will
observe that I was given many characteristic details descriptive
of my mother-in-law,i who was said to be easier to get at through
my child than through myself, and yet Nelly was obviously under
the impression that the person described was my own mother. She
never used any expression which definitely committed her to that
view, but was constantly apologising for "Mrs. Willgar's" greater
i See App. D, Sitting 3, p. 228.
194 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART
interest in my absent husband and child than in myself, the sitter,
a fact of which the interpretation would have been obvious enough
to any one who had realised the situation. Again, Nelly is often
puzzled by such a common thing as the difference in name between
mother and daughter when, as constantly happens, the name
that she gets at is the mother's maiden name or the daughters
married name. She has several times said in speaking of my
husband, whose two baptismal names, Arthur Woollgar, she hit
upon almost correctly at a very early stage of my acquaintance
with her, that she could not see that he was married, but he
had a Margaret (my own name) and a Helen (our only child's name)
belonging to him. Since Mrs. Thompson in the normal state, as
well as Nelly, knows my name and my daughter's, the inference is
obvious, but it has not been made. It was only some months after
my acquaintance with Mrs. Thompson and during a visit in my
house that Nelly said that " the Willgar gentleman " whom she had
previously described lived in the house, and was the person whom
Mrs. Thompson called Dr. Verrall. As Nelly herself calls me Mrs.
Verrall, the inference again seems obvious, but again it has not been
made. She talks to me freely of "the Willgar gentleman," or of
"Arthur," and she recognises that he belongs to me, but she has
never referred to him as my husband,i and continues occasionally to
express a gentle wonder why he so often comes into her thoughts
of my daughter Helen and me. To maintain this little device
deliberately would seem to be playing not only a purposeless but an
unnecessarily complicated game : it is only one of many similar
instances where we can see no satisfactory explanation of the motives
of the trance personality and must be content to register the facts.
It occasionally happens that the information given to a complete
stranger is accurate and detailed, as I have myself seen, but more
often in my experience does the knowledge of a person's surround
ings gradually develop and define itself, so that Nelly's statements
become more precise. If the increased knowledge thus shown were
such as could be obtained by enquiry or other normal means, this
increase of precision on acquaintance would be a very suspicions
circumstance. But in the cases under my observation the facts
stated have often been such as could not be ascertained.2 The case
'In some of the later sittings Nelly has spoken of "your husband," but has
never said that he is identical with " the Willgar gentleman."
aSee the account on p. 179 of the defining by Mrs. Cartwright of the confused
statements made on the previous day by Nelly.
xuv.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 195
of Theodore and the slippers, already quoted (see pp. 176, 227), is an
instance of increased knowledge on the part of the trance personality
where it was impossible that the medium could have learnt any further
facts. At the second sitting, when I asked about the matter, Nelly
added to her original statement the further facts that the slippers
were worked by me, that they were on canvas, that I had put in
the background, and that I had had much trouble over them. All
these things were in complete agreement with my own recollections,
strengthened by the memories of my father and sister, with whom I
talked the matter over in April, 1899, at Brighton shortly after my
first meeting with Mrs. Thompson. In the interval between April
and July, 1899, no communication whatever took place between Mrs.
Thompson and myself, and there never has been any communication
between her and my family. I had not spoken on the subject to
any one else, so that there was no other source whence she could
possibly have derived information in any normal way. This is by no
means an isolated case. It should be noted that the additional
details given at the second sitting were known to the living, includ
ing the sitter, and certainly not to the dead, the limit of whose
knowledge on the matter was probably reached in the statements of
the sensitive at the first sitting. In this and similar cases I am
therefore disposed to attribute the increase of knowledge on the part
of the sensitive either to the increased attention, conscious or un
conscious, given by the sitter after the subject has been introduced
at a sitting—that is, to telepathy in some form—or to an increase
in the power of the "control," which comes with familiarity, why
or how it is not yet possible to say.
Illustrations of increased knowledge of an ascertainable kind will
be given later, when I come to treat of "suspicious circumstances"
attending these phenomena, and I pass on to other points of interest
of what I have called a negative sort. The incoherence of the
statements made is sometimes very great; not only are the remarks
themselves often fragmentary and hardly intelligible, but they are
occasionally interpolated into the midst of irrelevant matter. When
the person or circumstance thus introduced is distinctive there is no
difficulty in assigning the remark to its proper place ; but I have
no doubt that a certain number of statements classed as incorrect or
unverifiable are as a fact statements wholly irrelevant to their con
text and belonging to some other series of communications. This
incoherence is more apt to occur in a bad sitting than in a good one;
but it is to be remembered that occasionally statements remarkably
196 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART
clear and correct are made during what is otherwise an unrepaying
sitting. Indeed, one of the most interesting things i that occurred within
my observation was let fall without any emphasis, and conveyed
no impression of its importance to me at the time—another
illustration, if illustration were needed, of the importance of recording
everything that is said during a sitting, even when the statement
appears wholly unintelligible.
The omissions on the part of the communicating personality are
no less remarkable than the statements; but classification is here
impossible and comment difficult. They may be roughly divided
under two heads, according as the gaps represent facts or the con
nexion between facts. Under this second head comes the failure,
already mentioned, to draw an obvious inference ; under the
former, the constant overlooking by the sensitive of things that
seem to the sitter important, and that are at least as easy to ascer
tain by normal means as other facts given. For instance, the family
of my husband consists of his father, two brothers, and two sisters.
The two sisters, the father and one brother have been often spoken
of; the profession of the father and brother has been correctly given,
and some characteristic details concerning them, but no mention has
been made of the other brother, though he is living in the same
town as the rest of the family, and is quite as intimate with us as
any of the others. A direct enquiry on the subject produced the
answer that Nelly could only see one brother, and at no subsequent
sitting has any reference been made to this second brother.'2 Instances
of similar omissions could be multiplied ; but the enumeration of them
would do no more than prove, as does the extreme triviality of many
of the statements made, that whatever is the cause that determines
the selection of incidents, it is not the expectation or desire of the
sitter.
The triviality of the incidents mentioned has received such frequent
illustration throughout this paper that nothing further need be said
on the subject. I think that my experience is perhaps exceptional in
this respect, in that I have not myself received any communications
i This is the case 1U in the list of statements unknown to the sitter, which ia of
too private a nature to be related (see p. 177).
* The fact that my husband has two brothers and two sisters appears in the
report of my sittings with Mrs. Piper, and the name of the second brother is there
given. This is not the only case where Mrs. Thompson has showed ignorance of
facts easily ascertainable by any one to whom my family circumstances were of any
interest.
xi,iv.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 197
purporting to come from intimate friends whom I have lost, and
therefore a much greater number of the statements made to me are
due to the observations of Nelly than is the case with those who are
supposed to be in direct communication with close friends of their
own. At the same time, I have had opportunities as note-taker
of witnessing what occurs in the case of others, and there is no
doubt that the matters of deep import touched on by the sensitive
are few and far between. Some there have been : allusions to deeply-
rooted feelings, and to profound convictions of the dead, unmistake-
able, and, at least at the moment, convincing to the sitter. It is true
that these references to the deeper and personal emotions are unlikely
to be of great evidential value; it is true also that there seems to
be a desire and an effort of the trance personality to respond to the
demands of the sitter, be those demands uttered or unacknowledged ;
and it should be said that what I have looked for first and above
all else throughout my sittings has been evidence of supernormal
faculty. This I believe that I have had, and mainly through the
very details whose triviality I am discussing. // If it be true, as I
suspect, that on what the sitter brings largely depends what the
sitter gets, others will probably have had a larger share than I in
the deeper and more stirring allusions to the past and the dead.
ASCKRTAINABLE FACTS AND SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES.
Any attempt to enable those interested in the subject to form a
judgment as to the value of the trance phenomena of Mrs. Thompson
would be incomplete without a notice of what may be called the
" suspicious circumstances " connected with those phenomena : in
other words, the occurrences which suggest that normal means of
information play their part in producing successful results. I have
said already that I think it probable that the sources of knowledge
of the sensitive are various, and I think it would be unreasonable to
suppose that among these sources should not be reckoned Mrs.
Thompson's own knowledge or guesses of the circumstances of her
sitters. fl\ might go further and say that it is possible that during
the trance or the transition from trance to a normal condition she
may have some faculty resembling the sharpened sense perceptions of
a hypnotic subject, and so be able to read or recognise by the touch
things that would be outside her ordinary range.'' Recurrent successes
capable of such explanation would diminish the value of her success,
even where the circumstances seemed unfavourable to any but super
normal methods of obtaining knowledge, as a considerable margin
198 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. • [PART
must in any case be allowed for mal-observation or error on the
part of the observer. Such successes, therefore, might fairly be said
to be " suspicious, " and in forming a general estimate of the value
of the phenomena, it seems of the utmost importance to see what
proportion of success is obtained under circumstances favouring the
suggestion that normal means of information have been illegitimately
employed.
It will here be necessary to revert to a group of statements that
has been mentioned already in this paper (p. 172), but not described or
analysed, namely, the statements which were correct but were ascertain-
able by normal means, for it is by an examination of these that we are
likely to find evidence, if anywhere, that recourse has been had to
normal means of investigation. In this class I have included all such
statements about the sitter as might be supposed obtainable by a
person desirous of obtaining them, and so I have here included names
and details concerning sitters supposed to be unknown to the sensitive,
if given at any but the first interview. The total number of such
statements made to me during the period to which I have applied the
test of statistics is 51 ; they may be subdivided into the following
classes :
(a) Names connected with sitters whose identity is known
to the sensitive, - - ... 14
(b) Facts contained in letters given to the sensitive, - 7
((.•) Facts in the history of the sitter or of a close connexion
of the sitter, - - - 23
(d) Facts probably known to Mrs. Thompson, - 3
(e) Facts that might have been guessed, ... - 4
Total, 51
I propose to treat of each of these heads in some detail, that the
reader may be able to judge how far the information given seems to
throw suspicion upon Mrs. Thompson's general methods. I take the
classes above enumerated in inverse order :
Class («).—The four following statements have been classed as things
that might have been accidentally guessed, or as " lucky shots."
(1) A sitter, Miss E. (let us say), was told that a person of her
name, E., was recently dead ; the sitter's name had not been given to
Mrs. Thompson, but this statement was made pretty late in the sitting
after letters bearing the lady's name upon them had been handed to the
sensitive. The fact was correct, but no further information was given
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 199
about the recently deceased Mr. E., about whom indeed the sitter her
self knew very little.
(2) The same sitter was told that her mother was dead ; but this
would be a safe conjecture to make in the case of the majority of sitters
of the lady's age. Some interesting and correct information about the
mother followed upon this statement, but it is not necessary to attribute
the opening remark that she was dead to supernormal information.
(3) The same sitter was said to have spent her summer holiday in
the company of a dead friend of hers, about whom a great deal of
interesting information had previously been given by the trance-
personality. The sitter had more than once spent her summer holiday,
or part of it, with the lady in question ; but in view of the fact, which
had appeared clearly in the course of the sittings, of the great intimacy
between the ladies, this suggestion is well within the range of likely
guesses.
. (4) It was said that a hair cross given to the sensitive had been kept
in a wooden box. This was the case ; but the box was a Japanese one,
and the wood has a peculiar odour, communicable in some instances to
its contents, though not detectably communicated to the cross. But in
any case such a statement would have a very good chance of being
correct.
Class (d).—These four cases may be dismissed as having no light
to throw on the subject of our enquiry, and we may go on to the
class (d), of "Facts that were probably known to the sensitive."
These are three in number :
(1) A letter (see App. D, p. 238) that had been given to the sensitive
to read was at a subsequent sitting said to have been kept in three
places: (1) a left-hand drawer; (2) the cupboard of a writing-table,
a cupboard which was fastened by turning a key ; and (3) an
old-fashioned writing-desk. These three places had in fact served
to keep the letter in question, and they were the only places
that had been used for more than temporary purposes in the
knowledge of the owner. It was impossible that the sensitive should
have any normal knowledge on the subject of the first and last
mentioned ; but it was from out of the locked cupboard of the writing-
table in my drawing-room, where Mrs. Thompson had sat during her
stay in my house, that I took the letter, in her presence, for the trance-
personality to read.
(2) and (3) Two statements were made to my daughter in a very
short sitting during Mrs. Thompson's visit to us, in December, 1899,
about a neighbour's child, a friend of my daughter's, namely, that she
200 Mrs. A. W. Verratt. [PART
had recently broken her leg, and that after the accident she had gone
abroad. The accident had occurred a few days before Mrs. Thompson's
visit to Cambridge in July, 1899, and during that visit my daughter
had often seen her. My daughter used to visit the child whose leg
had been broken, and it was a frequent subject of speculation with us
all whether the leg would be well in time for the child to go abroad
with the rest of her family. I have no proof that the subject was
spoken of before Mrs. Thompson, but under the circumstances I should
think it very improbable that it was not. I am disposed to regard her
mention of the incident, five months later, as an instance of deferred
memory, like those related on pages 187 foil.
The reader must judge whether any of these pieces of information
seem to suggest that the sensitive was making good use of knowledge
consciously possessed by her; my own impression is that these were
genuine recollections of what the sensitive knew by normal means,
interpolated among other matter that she did not and could not
possibly have so known. It is noticeable that the description of the
locked cupboard as the keeping-place for the letter was wedged in
between the mention of two other places of which the sensitive had
certainly no knowledge ; it was not likely that her mention of it would
be impressive, for even a forgetful sitter would be likely to remember
the circumstances immediately preceding the production of a test letter,
and, ex hypolhesi, unless the sitter did remember that the letter had
been in this cupboard, the mention of the fact by the trance personality
would not help to create an impression of the accuracy of the sensi
tive's remarks. It seems to me much more probable that these three
facts about where the letter had been were known to the sensitive, and
.that the difference between them is that in the one case the sitter knew
how the sensitive was possessed of that knowledge, whereas in the
other cases she did not. The two allusions to the accident to my
•daughter's friend would have been impressive had we forgotten that
Mrs. Thompson had had opportunities of learning the facts in the
•ordinary way, and perhaps some readers will believe that the trance-
personality took the risk of our having so forgotten. But the case is
closely parallel with the one related at length earlier in this paper, and
it is impossible for me to believe in that case that Mrs. Thompson, after
.our long acquaintanceship, thought so meanly of my memory or my
•common-sense as to suppose that I should be impressed by the not
wholly accurate reproduction of what I had myself told her in the
presence of a witness two months before.
Class (c).—The largest division is (c), facts in the history of a sitter
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 201
or of a close connexion of a sitter, mentioned after identification of the
person described. There are 23 of these. Two of the statements refer
to an incident which has been referred to in this paper, but not related
in detail; Nelly had at a first interview with a sitter unknown to Mrs.
Thompson made some remarkable and true statements about a friend
of that sitter recently dead, whom I have called Mrs. B., but she had
implied, though she had not actually said, that Mrs. B. was the sitter's
sister, and that Mr. B. was still alive. At a later sitting when
further details were given about Mrs. B., the trance personality cor
rected these two errors. These two corrections therefore have been
counted as true, but as capable of normal acquisition, for there had
been intervals between the sittings during which, if Mrs. Thompson
had identified the lady called Mrs. B., and had made enquiries about
her, she could have ascertained both the above facts ; whether the
correction was due to knowledge so obtained, or to telepathy from the
sitter, or to some other cause, I have no means of determining.
Three of the statements in this class refer to a particular sitter, who
at the time they were made had been identified by Mrs. Thompson and
was known to her. Nelly spoke of Miss Jane Harrison in her presence
to me as being connected with " monuments," and as associated with
the British Museum and the Museum at Kensington ; it was further
stated what her age would be at her next birthday. This also was
known to me after consideration, but not at the moment. These
three facts are all easily ascertainable, and have no evidential or
other value.
Four of the statements in this class refer to my own concerns ; Nelly
said that a piece of hair which I gave her when she was in my house
was the hair of a very delicate baby, so delicate that it "makes
mother's hand cold " ; Mrs. Thompson's hand, which she gave to me,
had suddenly become, very cold.i It would have been easy for any one
to have ascertained that some years ago I lost a very delicate child,2
whose health had been a permanent anxiety to us since her birth. It
would have been as easy to learn that the child was a girl, but this
Selly had not done ; she spoke of the child on this occasion as Helen's
i It is [ ii . i i i . ] i - worth noting that on another occasion, when speaking of a person
who had died suddenly from an accident, in full vigour of health, Nelly drew my
attention to the heat of Mrs. Thompson's hand, due, according to her, to the
extreme vitality of the person in (Iuestion.
2 In the account of my sittings with Mrs. Piper (Proceedings, vol. VI., pp.
584-9 and 641) it is stated that I. then had two children, both girls, and that
the younger was delicate.
202 Mm. A. W. Verrall. [PART
brother, and on an earlier occasion she had spoken of a dead boy
belonging to me, saying, there was "a little boy at our house
(i.e. dead), he would have been about 11 ; he's not got a name.
Little Arthur, I call him that. Mrs. Cartwright says he's a little
Arthur."i
I pass to the second statement referring to me. At a very early
sitting the sensitive said that there had been an old Frenchman want
ing to see me ; she gave a description fairly resembling my French
grandfather, who died before my birth, but she added that he was
certainly no relation.2 If she had guessed or known that I had
Frenchmen among the dead " belonging to " me, it would seem
gratuitous to insist that this one was no relation ; the statistical result
has been that these remarks appear as one incorrect statement (that
the Frenchman described was not my grandfather) and one true
ascertainable statement (that an old Frenchman belonged to me). By
a little more skill it would have been easy to avoid the false statement
without showing a suspicious knowledge of the facts, but this is not
a solitary instance of Nelly's apparent lack of skill.
The two last statements about my affairs are as follows : After
reading a letter from my mother under circumstances to be related
hereafter (p. 204), she said that there was a French look about the
writer's personality, and I was also told that I had known Mr.
Edmund Gurney. Both these facts are true and accessible. No
further comment seems necessary. I quote them here to make the
list complete.
The greater number of ascertainable statements (14) concern my
husband; all but two were made at a sitting on November 2nd, 1899,
when I had taken one of my husband's gloves to the sensitive. I had
done this because I had had through another sitter a few days before a
message to the effect that Nelly saw "Arthur Willgar3 walking on the
i The child in question was born in September, 1888, and would therefore hare
been just over 11 at the date of my sitting on October 4th, 1899. She died
before learning to talk, but it is incorrect to say that she had no name. With
regard to the words " little Arthur," it is interesting to note that an aunt of my
husband's, to whom reference was made by Nelly during the same sitting, always
spoke of her nephews' children by their father's names, as "little Arthurs,"
"little Toms," etc. This use of the phrase is suggested by the introduction
of the indefinite article before the words at their second occurrence, " Little
Arthur, I call him that. Mrs. Cartwright says he's a little Arthur."
2 See App. D, Sitting 2, p. 223.

mother's maiden name.
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 203
old Chain Pier at Brighton shortly before it was blown away ; I don't
think he's married, but he's got a Helen belonging to him."
It would be wearisome to enumerate all the things that the sensitive
said to me about the owner of the glove, whom she called Mr. Willgar,
but though there was a vague association with him of a " Margaret " as
well as of a " Helen," she did not speak of him as my husband. The
statements made concerned his appearance, his occupation, his health,
and his surroundings as a boy. But it is obvious that such facts as
that he used to be at an " ungreen seaside, a housified place," which
had developed within his recollection to a " nigger seaside," would be
readily enough made by any one who knew that my husband's family
have always lived at Brighton. This is not the place to relate either
the true and not ascertainable things, or the false things that were
given side by side with these. There were not many of either, the
larger number of things said ou this occasion being what any one
knowing the facts could know.
Two classes, (b) and (a), remain for discussion, which I have separated
from the rest, as they seem to call for special treatment—facts contained
in letters and names connected with the sitter. I have kept these two
classes to the end as I think that in them, if anywhere, are to be found
the " suspicious circumstances " for which we are looking. Among the
tabulated statements are seven referring to the contents of letters. On
October 5th, 1899, I took to Mrs. Thompson's house two letters
written to me about twenty years before by my mother. I had
selected these two as containing distinctive matter, after reading some
six or seven. The sitting was one of the most unsatisfactory I have
had ; Mrs. Thompson was in great anxiety about a friend who was on
that day undergoing a severe operation. I gave her one of the two
letters, not myself knowing which of the two it was. Mrs. Thompson
held the letter in her right hand, with some of her fingers inside the
envelope. This is the usual plan, as Nelly does not profess to be able
to tell anything of the contents of letters unless her mother's fingers
are on the writing. Mrs. Thompson was sitting in a chair close to me
and facing me, so that there is no question of her having withdrawn
the letter from the envelope, but as I took down in writing in my
notebook sixteen words between my giving the letter and the first
utterance of hers about it, it is possible that the sensitive may have had a
chance to see something when my eyes were on my notebook. I was
aware of the importance of watching and did what I could ; the right
hand holding the letter was hanging down at her side and in the
frequent glances that I gave I saw no suspicious action. Nelly said
0
204 Mrs. A. W, Verrall. [PART
that the words " I am sure " occurred in the letter, that it was a lady's
letter, that the writer was not very well,—not in good health when she
wrote. The words quoted do occur in the letter on the fourth or
outside page about a third of the way down, so that the letter having
been folded in three, they were at the bottom of the envelope, not
visible unless the letter was slipped out a little way. They could
of course have been touched by the sensitive. The writer who was
not in good health when she wrote, refers to the subject of her health
in one short sentence on the third page, so that the reference could not
have been seen unless the letter had been taken out, unfolded, and
opened. It is certain then that this sentence was not read by any
normal method, and if we are to suppose that the success, such as it
was, with this letter was obtained by normal methods, we must, I
think, count the remark about the health of the writer as a lucky shot.
It is possible to say the same of the other words, but I have read
through some twenty letters of this writer, and not found the words
" I am sure " in any other letter. I have no experience as to the
general possession of the faculty of reading words written in ink on
paper by passing the fingers over them; I have made a few experi
ments, but have not found myself able to feel anything that can be
interpreted, though I have occasionally been able, in the case of
handwritings very familiar to me, to assign the letters to their writers.
Probably the faculty of discerning by the touch varies with different
people.
The second letter, which had not left my handbag, was brought
home, put in an undirected envelope, and endorsed as having been
taken to town but not shown to Mrs. Thompson. It was placed
among a large number of other letters, awaiting periodical sorting and
destruction, on a shelf over my writing table in my husband's study.
There it was when Mrs. Thompson came to stay with me on December
4th of the same year. I had no intention of making any further use of
the letter, but on December 6th, at luncheon, Mrs. Thompson told me
that Mrs. Cartwright had said she would come, and as I had heard
that Mrs. Cartwright made a speciality of reading letters, I thought
that I would be provided with a letter in case she came. Accordingly,
at three o'clock when I went into the drawing-room where the sitting
was to be, I took with me the letter which I had brought back from
London unshown, and a small trinket, and without any concealment
put them both in the cupboard of my writing-table, turning the key as
usual. I did not leave the room till after the sitting, so that the letter
was certainly not read by Mrs. Thompson on the afternoon of the 6th.
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 205
The rooms used by Mrs. Thompson during her visit to me did not
include the study, where my husband sat except in the morning when
he was at College. Mrs. Thompson was not alone in the house at any
time during her visit, except for about three-quarters of an hour in the
morning of the 6th, when my husband, my daughter, and I were
all out. It will be seen, then, that there was a time when Mrs.
Thompson was alone with the servants in the house, and that the
.endorsement on the envelope would have drawn attention to the
.contents as a likely subject for experiment, had any one found the
letter. I am not suggesting that Mrs. Thompson found the letter;
I am explaining that I have not counted the accurate statements as
to its contents among those supernormally acquired, since I regret to
say that the conditions were not absolutely strict, as I had intended
that they should be, and at the time believed them to be.
The letter was held by Mrs. Thompson in the usual way, and
there was no question this time of the possibility of a glance while I
was taking notes, for there was another sitter, Miss Harrison, in the
room, who was at leisure to watch closely what was done, and
saw no suspicious movements.
The statements made by Mrs. Cartwright were as follows. I quote
the contemporary notes :
" ' My dear May,'—I can't read every word ; the lady who writes it is
troubled about ' my dear May's ' overstudying ; there is a great talk about
1 changing one's mind ' (after a pause to me). ' It's to you the letter is ; I
had so sensed the name Margaret to you ; that's strange. She either wants
yon to change your mind or ... it's written by a loving mother ' (after a
pause, distinctly). ' I cannot help you to find the book.' [I did not under
stand what she meant, whether she was reading the letter or speaking of
something else. I had no recollection of anything about a book, though the
general drift of the letter I knew, so I asked :] ' Are you saying that ? ' (Mrs.
Cartwright went on) : "You want a book. It's a French book that is lost.
I expect Rosa'si account of me makes you expect all to be correct. The
.difficulty lies in the time at which it was written, and in the placing and
replacing of it in different envelopes. 1 get the idea that when it was
written the lady was a little put out at something that had been done, but,
wished you not to gather that. Her thoughts are all of love, but she feels
.annoyance. ' Merrifield ' (pronounced Merrlfield with a strong accent on
.the second syllable, of which the ' i ' was made long). This seems to be the
name of a house more than of a person ; I can't get it as signature. I can't
realise how it is, but I feel that I must go to look for a French book,
and yet the letter was written long ago.' Mrs. Cartwright went at this
point, and Nelly returned. She asked for the letter, and on having it
i Mrs. Thompson.
206 Mrs. A. W. Veil-all. [PART
said she could only see 'Lily, not Helen's Lilian.' The next day I told
Nelly that the name given by her from the letter was right, to -which
she replied 'Oh yes, Edith.'"
The statements as to facts in this letter appear to be six in all,
namely, (1) the state of feeling of the writer; (2) the lost French
book ; (3) the relationship to me of the writer ; (4) the name
Merrifield ; (5) the name Lily ; (6) the name Edith. The facts are
as follows : The letter was written to me by my mother under a
misapprehension as to a proposed course of work for me ; she thought
I proposed to alter my work very considerably, taking on more
than had been planned ; she introduces her comments with the words
" This gives me an opportunity to laugh at you a bit for your
inconsistency." There is no sign of annoyance in the letter, which
ends, after calling me " not-know-your-own-mind," with the phrase
" your mother loves you," and the usual signature of initials only,
M. A. M. A later letter, written after my mother had found that
she had misunderstood my letter to her, shows that when she
wrote the earlier letter she had been seriously disturbed, not
to say vexed, at what she believed to be my change of plan.
That later letter was the one which had been given to Mrs.
Thompson in town; the remarks on this subject were on the
second and third (inner) pages, and so had certainly not been seen
by her in a normal manner. In the letter given to Mrs. Cart-
wright my mother mentions with regret that my sister had recently
lost her French exercise book, that they had hoped to recover it,
but had not done so. The names Lily and Edith do occur in the
letter, the former twice. Four other Christian names occur, besides
my sister's name, Flora, twice. It is noticeable that "Merrifield,"
though not the name of a house, is not in the signature; as
uttered by Mrs. Cartwright it suggests to me a sort of " portmanteau "
of my mother's name, which was Maria Merrifield. The trance
personality had mentioned the name Merrifield some time before
as belonging to me, and had then pronounced it rightly, and had
shown the conception she had of the meaning and pronunciation of
it by calling it, as an alternative, Happyfield, so that this curious mis
pronunciation seems to be wholly gratuitous on the assumption that
the sensitive was normally acquainted with the contents of the letter,
and was guessing that the final M. in the initials stood for the name she
had already used.
As bearing on the question of how the sensitive obtained her
knowledge of the contents of the letter, it is perhaps worth noting
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 207
that the account she gave is not quite what would be expected
from a person who had recently read it and wished to reproduce
its contents. The first thing mentioned in the letter, the actual raison
<?etre of the letter, was that a lamp, which was coming to me as
a present from some friends, had been sent off. Of this no mention
was made by Mrs. Cartwright, though it would seem a definite piece
of information likely to be noted by any one reading the letter with
a view to reproducing its contents. There is another small
error which struck me at the time. The letter really begins—"My
dearest May." This is represented in Mrs. Cartwright's version by
the words, " My dear May,'' a sufficiently obvious guess, but wholly
uncharacteristic of the writer. This particular form of opening was
never, to the best of my belief, used by the writer; it certainly does
not occur among the numerous letters which I have preserved. On
the whole, however, the contents of the letter are very well and
fully reproduced, and it is obvious that they must in some way
have become known to Mrs. Thompson or to the trance personality.
The reason why I have spoken of this as a possibly suspicious
circumstance is that it is the only letter which has been read in
detail within my knowledge with conspicuous success, and, unfor
tunately, owing to the circumstances above described, it is the only
letter of which I am unable to say that it is impossible that the
sensitive should have seen it.
It should be noted that I have myself only on one other occasion
besides the above given Mrs. Thompson a letter to read. So far she
has had no success ; but as it is possible that something more may
come of this letter later, I am unable to say any more on the
subject here. Other letters have been given her in my presence.
In one case she made incorrect statements about the writer ; in
another some correct and some incorrect; in the third case the
giving of a letter resulted in a very striking and definite allusion
to the death of a relative of the writer. (See page 214.)
I pass on to the last class (a) of true but discoverable facts—that
of names connected with the sitter. Fourteen out of the total ol
fifty-one ascertainable statements were, as I have said, names given on
various occasions in the course of the sittings. Three of these
belong to my husband's surroundings, three to my own, and eight to
Miss Harrison's. The three belonging to my husband are as follows :
(1) That "some one called Mary Elizabeth, is it Mary or Marian ?
They say Mary Elizabeth " knew him as a little boy. My husband's
younger sister is called Marian Elizabeth. She was, as I have been
208 Mr?. A. W. Verrall. [PART
told, called after two aunts, Mary and Elizabeth, a modification of
the former name being given to avoid confusion.
(2) Henry was said to be the name of his father. This is true.
(3) His own name was said to be Arthur Willgar : the latter
name being also that of his mother. This is almost correct. His
second name is Woollgar, which was his mother's maiden name.
Three of the names belong to me ; they are as follows :
(4) Merrifield was said to be the name of a lady in my family.
The name was given at first thus: "Merrifield, Merriman, Merry
thought, Merrifield ; there is an old lady named one of those who,"
etc. Later, Nelly said: "Mrs. Merrythought, that's not quite
right; it's like the name of a garden," and after in vain trying to
give me the name exactly, she said : " I will tell you how names
come to us. It's like a picture : I see school children enjoying
themselves. You can't say Merrymans, because that's not a name,
nor Merrypeople." Nelly, later on, spoke of my mother as " Mrs.
Happyfield," or " Mrs. Merrifield," with indifference.
(5) Nelly spoke of my sister by name, but said that her mother
had seen the name in the S.P.R. Journal a day or two before.
(6) Nelly said that Vernon was a name belonging to me : it is
the name of the Terrace where my father lives at Brighton.
In this collection of names there is nothing of any special
interest, as the facts could have no doubt been ascertained by
any one who wished to learn them, except perhaps in the introduc
tion of Mary Elizabeth, with the suggestion of Marian. Neither is
there anything the least suspicious in the way in which they were
used, nor in the fact that they were used.
The names connected with Miss Harrison are eight. One of
them was the name of a place where a dead friend had lived; but
as it was not mentioned till after the identification of the friend,
it has no evidential value, and is parallel to the introduction of
the name Vemon in my case. The other seven were given in two
instalments, three and four at a time, and it is the circumstances
connected with them which may at first sight be called " suspicious."
The first interview between Mrs. Thompson and Miss Harrison '
took place in my house on Dec. 6th, 1899, and I took notes.
Much was said about her mother, and I, who knew that Mrs.
i At this interview, when Miss Harrison was introduced as a stranger (see
p. 211), among many true things said to her came four names, correctly given.
With these I am not now dealiug, as they have been classed among the 90 true
statements that could not have been ascertained by normal means (see p. 172).
XLTV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 209
Harrison's maiden name had been Elizabeth Nelson, was constantly
looking for the name ; but we did not get it. On Thursday, the
7th Dec., Mrs. Thompson left Cambridge, and on Dec. 8th I
received from her, as told to her in trance, the following message :
" Grandfather Nelson tried to speak, and caused a mixed influence.
Elizabeth was dead ; Ellen was alive. She gave Ellen's name, but
not in full. She sends her love to Barker or Barker's son, and "
—the rest was indistinct, Mrs. Thompson added. Mrs. Thompson's
letter was dated Dec. 7th, 7.30 P.M.
This message, to be intelligible, needs a somewhat lengthy ex
planation. Miss Harrison's name, which is Jane Ellen Harrison,
had been given as Jane Harrison at the sitting :" not, therefore, in
full. Elizabeth Nelson is her mother's name, and Ellen Nelson is
the name of the mother's only sister, after whom Miss Harrison
received her second name. This aunt long outlived the mother ;
but it seems that by Ellen in the message is meant rather Miss
Harrison herself, since the name was said to have been given.
Barkston Mansions is the name of a building where Miss Harrison
had a flat for some years, but she had left it some two years before
the sitting. The message is obscure enough for an oracle, and
perhaps needs as much interpreting ; but, leaving aside the doubtful
Ellen, three points come out clearly : Grandfather Nelson, a dead
Elizabeth, and Barker or Barker's son.i These three names were
known to me at the time of the sitting, as well as to Miss Harrison
herself. I have ascertained that both names and the address are to
be found in earlier editions of Who's Who t though the latest editions
give Miss Harrison's later London address, Chenies Street Chambers,
and not Barkston Mansions.
But this does not finish the history of Miss Harrison's names.
Just before Christmas, about a fortnight after the sitting, I con
sulted the last edition of Who's Who? to see what information it
actually contained, and I thereby learnt the further facts that
Miss Harrison's mother was described as Elizabeth Hawksley, daughter
of Thomas Nelson, that her father's name was Charles, and that among
her published works was mentioned a book on Greek vases, in which
she had collaborated with Mr. D. S. Maccoll. On January 3rd, 1900,
Miss Harrison and I sat again with Mrs. Thompson, and the first
remark that Nelly made was that Miss Harrison's mother was
i The " she " referred to in the message is a new personality, who tried to
communicate, and who certainly did know Miss Harrison while she lived at
Barkiton Mansions.
210 Mrs. A. W. Yen-all. [PART
named Elizabeth, then that she was Elizabeth Hawksley or Hortsly ;
later on she said that Miss Harrison's father was called Charles,
that the grandfather was Thomas Nelson, and that a Mr. Coll, Cawl,
Maccole, gave Miss Harrison a lot of papers that were not cheques
or bank-notes. The name Barkston was also uttered, and on my
asking Nelly what it was, she said that it was the name of a
house, Barkston Street, Place, Gardens.
Here, then, at this sitting were produced four new names, Hawkslej",
Charles, Thomas, and Maccoll, all to be found in Who's Who? and
all recently suggested to me by the paragraph in Who's JThoi The
fact that seven names were given after the identification of the
sitter, when there 'had been time for investigation of her history, is
undoubtedly very suspicious, but no less curious is the division of these
names into two groups of three and four names respectively, cor
responding with the information possessed by mo. It would have
been more satisfactory if the first batch had been given at the first
interview with the then unknown sitter, but if this knowledge was as a
fact obtained by the sensitive through the book of reference in ques
tion, it is a most extraordinary coincidence that the names which
were in the book, but which I did not then know—Hawksley, Thomas
and Charles—should not have been given till after I did know them.
In forming a judgment on these facts I think some attention also
should be paid to the form in which the word Barkston appears in
the first communication, a written one, from Mrs. Thompson, namely,
as Barker or Barker's son. This does not look like the error of a
copyist but of a hearer, and if we are to suppose that the sensitive
obtained information from a normal source and endeavoured by the use
of such information to impress the sitter, we are bound to admit
that the method adopted was certainly not obvious, that it was, indeed,
so ingenious that it might easily have failed of its purpose ; for it is
plain that the phrase " she sends her love to Barker or Barker's son "
might very easily have been put down as sheer nonsense, when it is
remembered that Barkston Gardens was not the actual present address
of the sitter.i But it will be said by the sceptic, and it cannot be
denied, that the ingenuity of the fraudulent medium is only equalled
by that of the interpreter of oracles, and the question obviously admits
of no certain answer. The reader must form his own judgment on
the facts.
i It was, as I have said, the address familiar to the friend who is represented in
Mrs. Thompson's message as sending the communication.
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 211
FIRST INTERVIEWS.
The best way, as it seems to me, of throwing light on the question of
how the sensitive obtains her information is to examine very carefully
what facts she is able to give at a first interview with an unknown
sitter.i I have myself only a limited experience of this, as I
have only twice introduced new sitters. One of these two was
Miss Harrison, and it will be instructive to note what facts
were told her before the sensitive had any opportunity of consulting
biographical dictionaries. The other new sitter came to a meeting
which is not included in the sittings which have furnished my statistics,
and with an account of what happened at these two " first sittings " I
will conclude this already lengthy paper.
It was during Mrs. Thompson's visit to me in December, 1899, that
I decided to introduce to her Miss Jane Harrison. I arranged with
Miss Harrison, who was at the time in residence at Newnham College,
to come to my house in the afternoon of December 6th, and to wait
in my husband's study till I should send for her. I gave orders to the
maid at three in the afternoon, after Mrs. Thompson was estab
lished in the drawing-room for the sitting, to show Miss Harrison into
the study when she came, and not to announce her to me in the
drawing-room. I then told my daughter that when the trance had
begun I should send her from the drawing-room to bring in Miss
Harrison from the study, and my daughter was not alone with Mrs.
Thompson after hearing this. As no other persons besides those just
mentioned knew of the arrangement between Miss Harrison and myself
that she should have a sitting, and as Miss Harrison did not come to
our house or otherwise see Mrs. Thompson during the two days
preceding the sitting, when Mrs. Thompson was my guest, I think
it may be taken as certain that Miss Harrison was, as I intended
she should be, a wholly unknown stranger.
When the trance had well begun and I heard the bell
ring, and so knew that the visitor was in the house, I sent my
daughter away, and Miss Harrison came silently into the room and sat
on a sofa at a little distance. Mrs. Thompson had been informed
that a new visitor was to come, and that the visitor was a lady. She
had expressed some anxiety lest it should be a lady whom she already
knew and with whom she had not had a successful sitting, and I had
i For this purpose I do not count myself as an unknown sitter. Mrs. Thompson
knew my name when I first met her, and it was then understood that I was to have
a sitting some day.
212 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART
reassured her, or rather Nelly, on this point. That was all that
had been said on the subject. I give the report of the opening of the
sitting from my notes taken at the time, read over to Miss Harrison and
approved by her, and written out the next day :
Nelly (to J. E. H.). " Have you been pouring something out of one
bottle into another, from a wide-necked one into another ? I quite distinctly
see it." (After a short pause.) " I will do that letter."
[Miss Harrison had brought three or four letters in a bag, but had not
taken them out. At this Miss H. gave me one of them in a blank
envelope and said :]
Miss H. " I don't know which letter I've given you."
Nelly. " It doesn't matter " (holding the letter in its envelope). " It
seems like . . . not a happy feeling, Mrs. Verrall; put mother's fingers on
the letter." (I inserted Mrs. Thompson's fingers into the letter.)
Nelly. " The lady is dead belonging to this letter ; she's not Jinny's
relation. Jimmy, Jemmy, Jenny. The one that writes the letter has a
strange influence. It's a man's influence in a woman's mind, there are
echoes of a man's thoughts. I don't know whether a man wrote it."
Nelly then invited " Jinny " to come nearer, which Miss Harrison did.
Nelly. " I can see you talking to Mrs. Sidgwick ; you are one of the
talkers at Mrs. Sidgwick's house. You have not got a mother. Your
mother is at our house ; she thought : ' Jinny.' Your mother died and
some one else in the same year."
Miss H. " It was a long time ago."
Nelly. " It makes me feel sad. After your mother died something cheery
happened, a success, but too late for your mother to know. There's a
Margaret associated with you, and Anna, 1 Anna belonged to a dead
lady, not old, looks 45 now ; has a smooth face. The lady (Miss
Harrison's mother) had a crape shawl with silk fringe ; I can see it
on ; you have a photograph of her with the shawl, a grand dress sticking
out, with the shawl on cornerways. A lady belonging to you had
a cancer ; you heard about that with other sad things. You've got a ring
belonging to some one, not your mother, that's dead."
Miss H. " I had, but I've lost it."
Nelly. " Did you leave it by the wash basin ? It was lost not in
Cambridge, but further away. Poor thing, she had her head aching, she lay
down a long time, did not die quickly. She has been dead a long time.
She's a bright lady, not a talking lady."
The sitting was a long one and cannot be printed without omissions,
as it contains references to some private matters, and to some other
matter which is incomplete at present and to which it would be
premature to refer. But the above quotation will show the reader
that definite statements were made to an unknown sitter without
i Not the real name.
xuv.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 213
any suggestion from either the sitter or the note-taker, and these
definite statements are almost without exception correct. Thus, as
regards the remark about the bottle from which Miss Harrison was said
to have been pouring something, this conveyed no impression to me at
the time, nor to Miss Harrison. Later on in the sitting, Nelly returned
to the subject, saying, " I see a bottle department, this lady will think
of me when she pours from one bottle to another, perhaps glycerine
(this word was said with some hesitation) ; it's not a scientific depart
ment." Miss Harrison, who at the second reference to the bottles
had wondered whether Nelly was thinking of a recent visit she had
made to a newly-equipped laboratory at Newnham College, here asked
whether Nelly could see the bottles, and Nelly answered, "They are
glass bottles, one wider in the neck than the other." It was only on
her way home after the sitting that Miss Harrison remembered that she
had during the last two months been regularly making " sparklets," and
so had constantly been engaged in filling a narrow-necked glass bottle
from a wider mouthed one. It seems likely that the word glycerine
was an attempt to give the characteristic word " gazogene," but even
though this word was not given, there can be no doubt that Nelly's
general account is appropriate, and aptly describes what Miss Harrison,
unknown to me, had been constantly doing, and would soon do again.
The next statement concerned the letter given, which was one of
two or three brought by Miss Harrison. As she said at the time, she
was not sure which letter she had taken out. It was found after the
sitting that the writer was a man and was alive. The first statement
made by Nelly was therefore incorrect, and the later remarks are too '
vague to be valuable, though the form of the words suggests a gradual
change of impression on the part of the speaker, and apparently a final
inclination to think the writer a man. It is interesting to note that as
neither of the persons present knew at the time which letter the
sensitive was holding, the modification of her view can have been due
neither to thought transference nor to fishing.
The use of the name " Jinny " is very interesting. It was a name
used in Miss Harrison's childhood, and is still used by her family,
but not by any of her Cambridge friends. Later on the name Jane
was used when Nelly was speaking of a recently dead friend of
Miss Harrison's who called her Jane, but Nelly did not at first seem to
realise who Jane was ; she had called the sitter Jinny, and suddenly
said, after describing the dead friend, " who was Jane t She's
associated with the lady (i.e. the dead lady), it's not her name ;
•Jane was a sorry lady because this lady died." Again a few
•214 Mr». A. W. Verrall. [PART
minutes later she turned to me and asked me whether I called Miss
Harrison Jinny, a name, she said, which was nicer than Jane.
The sensitive correctly stated that Miss Harrison's mother was dead,
and there is in the possession of the eldest daughter a framed minia
ture showing Mrs. Harrison in a dress with crinoline and a fringeil
shawl worn " cornerwise." The two names, Margaret and Anna,i
have associations for Miss Harrison, and the description of the lady to
whom " Anna " belonged is accurate as far as it goes. The name of the
lady was not given by Nelly in connexion with her, but almost immedi
ately after the short description of this lady, whom I have called Mrs.
B., Nelly mentioned the surname in a form very usual with her when
she has a fact to communicate of which she does not apparently see
the precise significance. She said, " What's B ? " No answer
was made, and she went on to mention the Christian name and
surname of the lady's husband, also dead, but dismissed them as those
of the friend of a former sitter. This former sitter was well acquainted
with Mrs. B. and with her husband, and had, in fact, received from
Nelly some months earlier a message purporting to come from Mr. B.,
whose Christian and surname were mentioned by Nelly. There would
have been no reason for Mrs. Thompson to think it likely that Miss
Harrison and the former sitter would have acquaintance in common,
even had she known Miss Harrison. As a fact Nelly spoke in Miss
Harrison's sitting as though the husband were dead, and she did not
give any name to the wife; but that in some inexplicable way the
trance personality was aware of the name is, I think, shown by the
otherwise motiveless introduction of the surname and husband's full
name, though she dismissed them as inappropriate on this occasion.
At this sitting, in close conjunction with a description of Mrs. B.,
came the mention of her husband's name, though it was not till a
subsequent sitting that Nelly completed the identification and recog
nised that the Mr. B. of one of her sitters was the husband of
the lady described to Miss Harrison at this first sitting with her.
It is true that the owner of the ring which had been lost died after a
lingering illness, of which one of the most marked and distressing
symptoms was constant severe headache.
The most striking incident in this sitting has been briefly referred to
earlier in this paper. It also relates to Mrs. B. One of the letters
brought by Miss Harrison (see page 212) was given to the sensitive,
who instantly spoke of the loss sustained by some relatives of the
writer, and went on to give a description of the dead lady and of the
i Not the real name.
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 215
circumstances of her death, which made the identification beyond dispute.
The letter was not written by the dead lady herself, but by a relative,
and this fact was apparently recognised by Nelly, for she said to me
in reference to the letter contained in the envelope which she held in
her hand, " Mrs. Verrall, a live person's letter won't get me on to a dead
person."
Later in the same sitting it was correctly stated that Miss Harrison
had come to my house from Newnham College, and an additional
description was given, in order that we might not think Nelly was
"only guessing," which correctly determined in which of the three
Halls Miss Harrison was living.
The full name, Christian and surname, of a lady who had already been
spoken of to me by name at an earlier sitting as a friend of mine, was-
mentioned by Nelly as one whom " this lady " (Miss Harrison) knew
all about, and in the few words that followed Nelly seemed to us both
to describe accurately the relations between the lady named and Miss
Harrison. The lady was a College friend of us both, but more
intimate with me.
In this first sitting, then, with Miss Harrison, a stranger, introduced
under the conditions described above, names were given and incidents
related, which warrant, in my opinion, the assertion that Mrs.
Thompson showed herself possessed of knowledge not normally
attainable. The same thing occurred in the case of the other sitter
whom I introduced in December, 1900, also under conditions
precluding the possibility of previous investigations by the sensitive
into his antecedents.
I bad arranged with Mrs. Thompson to bring a friend to a sitting on
Monday, December 1 7, 1900. I was to meet Mrs. Thompson in town and
go with her to the rooms of the Society in Buckingham Street, at 2.30
o'clock. The sitter was to come to the rooms not before three and
knock at the door without entering, to inform me of his arrival, as
I was anxious that he should not enter until the trance had begun.
No one but the sitter, myself and my husband knew who it was that I
proposed to introduce. The arrangements were carried out as planned.
After Mrs. Thompson had become entranced, I brought the sitter into
the room, where he took up a position behind a screen. It was
impossible that Mrs. Thompson should have seen him. The early part
of the sitting was fairly good ; the sensitive correctly described the
state of health of the visitor and his habitual occupations. I gave her
in succession two objects which he handed to me, a pair of sleeve links
and a gentleman's ring. She at once asked for the tie which belonged
216 Mrs. A. W. Yen-all. [PART
to the ring, and added that the tie was black and that it belonged to
the gentleman then sitting behind what she resentfully spoke of as
" that umbrella." The ring had, as I found afterwards, been taken off
the black tie worn by the sitter to give to the sensitive, but there was
nothing to show that it had been so worn. I suppose it is possible
that the movements made in thus removing it may have been audible to
the sensitive, but I do not see how the colour of the tie could have
been discovered even by hyperaesthesia.
There seemed throughout the interview a considerable confusion
between the affairs of the sitter and my own. This was perhaps
due to the perplexity introduced by the new condition,i as it has
not occurred to anything like the same extent in other cases within
my experience. Nelly seemed restless and anxious, and passed from
topic to topic much more rapidly than is usual with her. It was
difficult to analyse her somewhat discursive remarks, but undoubtedly
things were said that were appropriate to the sitter's friends and
other things that referred to mine. There was, however, a con
siderable amount of unidentifiable matter.
At the end of an hour, as we had arranged, the sitter came out
from behind the screen, and from that moment things went much
better. Nelly expressed regret, as the links were handed back, at
not having been able to "get anything" about them. She added:
" I should like something belonging to the links : there's a little hair
chain belonging to them." The sitter replied that he had not got
that, and could not find or bring it. Nelly went on to describe it
in some detail: it had, she said, "little rounds on, round gold things,
that used to move up and down." The sitter has since informed
me that the hair chain, belonging to the owner of the links, had
gold rings upon it at intervals, but that they were not moveable.
Nelly further said that, in default of the chain, she would like the
"pencil, with separate leads to be fitted in, not an ordinary pencil
like that (taking up a wooden pencil from the table) ; you put the
leads into it separately." She went on to say that there had been
a difficulty about getting leads to fit the pencil. It is true that the
sitter possesses a gold pencil case that had belonged to the owner
of the links and the hair chain, and that he had had considerable
difficulty in obtaining leads that would fit it. He writes to me that
•"after she had mentioned the chain, which I had up to that moment
entirely forgotten, I was not surprised at her mentioning the pencil
case, but was rather surprised at her reminding me of the difficulty
i The sitter has been visible to Nelly in all my other sittings.
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 217
that I had had in getting leads to fit it." Nelly further said that
the same person " had a box with compasses in." This statement
is also correct. She mentioned no other articles in connexion with
the links.
Now, I think that any impartial reader will admit that the cir
cumstances related above are very remarkable, and even if they
stood alone, would go far to substantiate the claim of the sensitive
to the possession of supernormal knowledge. A stranger gives to
the sensitive a pair of gold sleeve links that had belonged to a
friend who died out of England, and who had certainly never met
Mrs. Thompson, no one but himself knowing what article he intended
to bring ; the sensitive tells him of three other articles belonging to
the owner of the links, a hair chain with moveable gold rings, a
pencil case to which there had been difficulty in fitting leads, and a
box containing compasses,—all which articles did, as a fact, belong
to the owner of the links ; she makes no mention of articles which
he did not possess; the description of the article? is definite, and
with the exception of the moveability of the rings, entirely accurate.
Without propounding any theory as to how Mrs. Thompson's trance
personality obtained this information, I think that we are justified in
attributing it to no method hitherto recognised as normal.
I have now presented all the facts and all the observations which
I have so far been able to record concerning the phenomena occurring
in the case of Mrs. Thompson. I have taken especial pains to draw
attention to the failures and shortcomings, as well as to the suc
cesses, which I have personally observed. In particular, I have
collected together for purposes of comparison a little group of
circumstances, which, did they stand alone, might seem to suggest
the illegitimate employment of normal means of acquiring informa
tion, though I wish here to repeat emphatically that throughout the
whole course of my acquaintance with Mrs. Thompson, no single
suspicious or even doubtful incident has come within my knowledge.
This group of facts must be judged, not in isolation, but in its
relation with other groups; indeed, the whole of the phenomena
recorded by me must be regarded as merely part, and not a very
large part, of the general evidence that has been collected.
It is not my intention in this paper to express any opinion
on the general character of the phenomena presented by Mrs.
Thompson. To do so would require a more intimate acquaintance
than I have with the records of other observers of this sensitive,
218 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PAUT
and would need deep and wide knowledge of the results of
similar experiments with other trance mediums ; it would demand
a training and experience, not to mention other qualities, to
which I have no claim. All I have here attempted is to give
a full account of the phenomena occurring under my personal
observation. My attempt at classification is an endeavour to make
the details easier to follow, and is made rather with the hope of
enabling the reader to grasp these details than of suggesting any
theory for their explanation. That Mrs. Thompson is possessed
of knowledge not normally obtained I regard as established beyond
a doubt ; that the hypothesis of fraud, conscious or unconscious on
her part, fails to explain the phenomena, seems to be equally
certain; that to more causes than one is to be attributed the
success which I have recorded seems to me likely. There is, I
believe, some evidence to indicate that telepathy between the sitter
and the trance personality is one of these contributory causes.
But that telepathy from the living, even in an extended sense of
the term, does not furnish a complete explanation of the occurrences
observed by me, is, as readers of this paper will have noticed, my
present belief. More than this I do not feel warranted in saying
until further evidence has been obtained : it is to the records of
other observers and to the accumulation of the experience of different
sitters that we must look for the material to enable us to judge what
further causes are at work.

Note on the above. —Several of the above seem hardly to be predic
tions in the ordinary sense of the term, but as they refer to the future,
I have had to classify them as such for the purpose of the statistics of
this paper ; my own impression is that when the trance personality has
an undefined impression of something concerning the sitter, the
expression of that feeling is apt to take the form of a vague statement.
Sometimes this is negative in form, as " I don't mean such and such a
thing," where the " such and such a thing," though apparently unintel
ligible to the speaker, has a perfectly definite and appropriate meaning
to the sitter who knows the whole of the facts (see p. 214). Sometimes
the form is interrogative ; Nelly may say "Do you ever do so and so ? "
the fact being that the action described is appropriate to some one to
whom the sensitive has been referring, but not to the sitter. Some
times, as in those cases classed as predictions, the trance personality
seems to use the prophetic form to convey information of which she
has no clear knowledge. For instance, in case (B) (5) it was not
likely, nor has it happened, that the lady " D." would go to the North
p
220 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PAKT
on any errand, sad or otherwise. But it was true, though unknown to
Nelly, that her old home had for years been in the North, and, as
might be expected, she had gone North more than once "on sad
errands"; and so "going North on a sad errand" was a description,
had it referred not to the future but to the past, which would have
been applicable to the lady in question. In case (B) (8) Mrs.
Thompson knew of " E.'s " illness, and it is possible that the remark
that he would never completely get over it, might be only the expres
sion of her feeling that his recovery was not proceeding rapidly; on
several occasions I have found that the trance personality takes a
depressed view when there is any question of illness. In case
(B) (9), where it was stated that " F." would suffer from a specified
disease before a specified age, two statements were in fact made,
one that "F." would have a certain trouble with his health, and
the other that he was not yet 50 years old. The sensitive had
more than once referred to the health of "F.," saying, what was
not correct, that he suffered from a particular weakness; she
had also expressed her conviction that he would not believe that this
was the case, and finally the remark was made, here classed as a
prediction, "'F.' is not fifty yet, he will not laugh so much at the
health trouble when he is fifty." " F." as a fact was not 49 when this
was said ; he is now past fifty, but has had no symptoms of the particular
health trouble mentioned ; thus this remark, if it is to be regarded as a
prediction, is not fulfilled; but if it is only a circuitous way of mention
ing " F.'s " age, it is a correct statement of an ascertainable fact, and
has for purposes of these statistics been counted under that head.
It is worth noting in this connexion that at the time these remarks
were made by the sensitive, the sitter was suffering from an attack of
pain due, as was subsequently determined by medical advice, to the
particular health trouble wrongly ascribed by the sensitive to the
sitter's friend, " F."

(27) That X. had at a definite date been on the point of
visiting Y.
(28) That a person of a specified type was at the sitter's house on
the day of the sitting.
(29) That Z. had no brother.
(30) That an old man of a specified nationality was a friend and
not the grandfather of the sitter.
(31) That in a box already previously mentioned by the sensitive
was a specified article.
(32) That Ai, had made a specified article for the sitter.
(33) That a certain room had curtains of a specified colour.
Note on the above.—Of these 33 incorrect statements, 23 were known
to the sitter at the time to be false, 10 were discovered to be so after
222 Mrs. A. W. Vermll. [PART
enquiry. Nos. 7, 21, 24, 26 were subsequently corrected without
suggestion from the sitter; Nos. 7 and 21 refer to the same event,
" G. " being the mother of " 0.," and appear consequently as two
false, but (after correction) as one true statement. The child's age was
correctly given. This incident is related in detail on page 201. No.
29 was indirect!)- corrected by the giving of a description of one of the
two brothers of " Z." No. 24 was corrected directly at a later sitting;
so were Nos. 15, 25, and 26, the right name being given in case
25. The first attempt at the name, which it was quite impossible
for the sensitive to have known, was not wholly wrong ; it was as if a
name had been said to be Ernestine, when it was, as a fact, Emmeline.
But as these corrections were not made until after the series of sittings
which have furnished the statistics for this paper, they do not appear
among the correct statements. No. 3 was in agreement with the
suggestion of a doctor who had recently seen " C.," a suggestion known
to " C.'s " wife, the sitter, but was not, so far as is known, true. In
No. 16, the name was not very unlike, Vernon for Ventnor. As to
No. 28, one of the inhabitants of the house expected a visitor answering
to the description on the day in question, but the visitor did not come.
The sitter knew nothing of this expectation. No. 30 is classed as a
false statement. The sitter had no old friend of the specified
nationality, but her grandfather, dead before her birth, was of the
nationality in question, and answered generally to the personal
description given. His influence was said to be " like that of a
grandfather," but even when the sitter suggested that he probably
was her grandfather, the trance personality refused to accept the
suggestion.

REFERRED TO IN THE PRECEDING PAPER, WITH
EXPLANATIONS AND COMMENTS.
SITTING 2. JULY 27m, 1899.
At Cambridge ; present, Mrs. Thompson, Miss Johnson, and Mrs. Verrall.
The notes were taken during the sitting by Miss Johnson.
(Mrs. Verrall comes in, and Nelly complains of her not coming sooner.)
(I)i A'elly. "Old Frenchman was waiting for you."
Jfrs. V. " Shall be delighted to see him."
Nelly. " Had he a ... he was like . . . not uncle, or mother, or any rela
tion—old when you were little girl—he liked little girls, was friend of all
people—influence on your family like that of a grandfather, but he was not a
relation. Not like a Frenchman—was gray—no beard—his ears rather
large, rather long."
Jfrs. V. "Yes, yes."
Nelly. " Forehead rather high."
Mrs. V. "I think he was a relation, wasn't he ?"
Nelly. " No, you all made a fuss when he came, like for visitors."
Jfrs. V. " I thought he was like relation I hadn't seen."
Nelly. " Was one of wise men, knew a lot of things, Marie belonging to
him. What makes you. . . . You speak good French, Mr. Myers said so,
but there seems a great Frenchiness about you, Louise too, all French
about."
(2) Mrs. V. " I have nothing belonging to French people here."
Mrs. V. here gave Nelly a little hair cross.
Nelly. " Where's the black velvet that this was on ?"
Mrt. V. "I've never had it ; it used to be on black velvet, but I never
had it."
Nelly. " This is feeling of long way off—not anybody died in Cambridge,
but long way off."
Mrt. V. " Yes, more difficult for you to find."
Nelly. " Feeling of lady with fair hair- parted—and clear face—not
coloured face, but clear. Hair drawn round like this" (drawing her own
hair round her ears to show what she meant).
Mrt. V. "Yes."
Nelly. "Had lot of Homerton lace and Maltese lace—rather prim about
her lace—not so old as the old-fashionedness of her."
MTU. V. "Yes."
i The record of the sitting has been divided into numbered sections for convenience of
reference in the comment that follows.
224 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART
Nelly. " She didn't care what people thought of her. Her writing slant
ing to right, upright and clear—great example to other people—don't get
name with it. Feeling as if she had an operation—not cancer or any great
thing, but something got into her, into her hand, some small thing, was
opened and got out—somebody can find out. There's Christopher belougin<;
to it—connected."
Mrs. V. " Not sure, but think there is."
NMy. "One of the come-downs from this was Parliamentary—had some
disappointment about Parliamentary. Don't let them work too hard at it.
Dou't let Helen work too hard at what she started—something new she's
started—if she does, she'll have to stop—other things don't hurt her so
much. Have you got something else belonging to the same ? "
Mrs. V. "No."
Nelly. " This has been in wooden work box, not a jewel case with velvet.'
Mrs. V. "Yes."
Nelly. " In that box little ivory carved thing."
Mrs. V. " Two or three other things in box, not ivory."
Nelly. "Well, bone, or white, pearly something—I want to go out of box
into house where the box is."
Mrs. IF. " It's been a long time in that box."
(3) Nelly. " Adolphe, Adolphe, he was like Lebas," spelling it, "some
body years ago in France that was connections. Feeling of people is like
that" (sitting very upright) ; "they never gave way to excitement ; it was
like primness personified. Don't know if it was widow, but had white frill
in front, quilling. Although she was prim, she was delicate—afraid of cold
—rather shrinking—liked hot water bottles and things to wear in bed and
all those wrapping up things."
Mrs. V. "What about operation?"
Nelly. "Something that ran in—like crochet hook or needle—red-faced
man—clean shaven—that took it out."
Mm. V. "Quite likely,—the lady is closely connected with me."
Nelly. " Yes, but that won't help me."
(4) Mrs. V. " How about Theodore and slippers ? "
Nelly. " You cobbled those slippers."
Mrs. V. "Yes."
Nelly. " There were animals ou canvas, and you filled it in."
Mrs. V. " Yes, I talked it over with my sister after seeing you. . . ."
Nelly. "They'd got their heads ou, and you filled in the bodies."
Mrs. V. "Yes."
i\'elly. "You did it all the wrong way first, and had to do it over again."
Mrs. V. " Yes, I talked it over with my sister, and then we remembered
all about it."
Nelly.—" And now you remember more than you did before."
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 225
(5) Mrt. I'. "[It was] Needle, not crochet hook, that ran into the
lady."
Hetty. "Can see the doctor more than person. Only sort of cakes she
had . . . was so fond of sponge cakes."
Mrs, r. "Fingers?"
Nelly. " No, not fingers, like those sponge cakes you give to a child."
Here there was a short interruption as a visitor entered the room.
Nelly. "Somebody belonging to you very brilliant musician—more than
you—got a metz voice."
Mrt. V. " Mezzo soprano ? "
Netty. " Yes. Can sing those low notes very nicely. That music gave this
one great pleasure—happiness. Prim one used to sit and hear people talk ;
everybody liked her because she was such a good listener.
"That doctor that had the needle had an accident with his carriage—in
connection with his carriage ; he was not hurt. She remembers it. Lintou,
Linton—that doctor got somebody at Lynmouth or Linton—that lady knew
about it."
(Here Miss Johnson went away for a few minutes and the notes were
taken by Mrs. V.)
(6) Netty. " Dead boy in charge of the lady, hardly born, but did live.
Hear about your mother, knew Helen, Helen hardly knew her."
(Here Miss Johnson came back and took notes.)
Ndly. " Like an old English lady that liked to talk French—Frenchman
that was her father. Dr. Arthur Myers knew this old lady."
Mrt. V. "Which? My mother?"
Netty. " Yes. Do you know where she is ? Seems as if she knows George
Eliot—in that group, and when I talk to Mrs. Sidgwick or you, Six Mile
Bottom comes. Seems mother did take interest in boat race—liked to know
Cambridge boat race people. She would sit in her prim way and like to
know—not gossip, but liked to go and hear all news she couldn't go and look
for herself.
" Feeling with her of bad cough, but not asthmatical—sharper, not like
bronchitis, but little shrill cough—not phthisis—had two great . . . funny
how she does her mouth—like way of pulling mouth up (pulling her mouth
in and together) as if listening—like prim way of putting her mouth. Very
fond of pair of velvet boots."
Mn. V. " Yes, very."
Nelly. " She's just shown me them—red stuff—flannel—there—with velvet
and with loop in elastic boots. She liked little silk apron—with black lace
and silk—elastic and button at side ; it belonged to some one else and given
to her. You'll excuse her wearing white stockings."
Mn. V. " This is prim lady, not my mother ?"
Nelly. " Yes. Don't mix them. Velvet boots not your mother, but the
prim lady, and the silk apron."
Mrt. V. "Oh, yes, I know the apron quite well."
226 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART
Nelly. "It's like a blackboard, and on blackboard comes pictures, and I
tell you as they come. Sometimes people come and talk, but sometimes
pictures."
Comments on the above account of Sitting 2.
(1) No old Frenchman visited at our house. My mother's father, who
died before her marriage, was French. The description given answers fairly
well to my knowledge of him derived from description and a portrait in my
father's house at Brighton, where Mrs. Thompson had never been. He was
" not like a Frenchman," being fair with blue eyes, he had " no beard," his
forehead was " rather large," but I know of no peculiarity about his ears.
He was not a "wise man," but was a "friend of all people." My mother was
called " Marie," and the name " Louis," though not " Louise," occurs in her
family. Mr. Myers and I had spoken in Mrs. Thompson's presence of the
possibility of my reading a paper in French at the Paris Congress, so that
Mrs. Thompson's normal personality knew that I spoke French. The fa<_-t
that my mother's family was French has been mentioned in the report on
Mrs. Piper's sittings (Proceedings, Vol. VI.), so that any one wishing to obtain
facts about me would have had no difficulty in discovering that I had H
French grandfather.
(2) The hair cross was taken by me from a small wooden Japanese box
with drawers ; the wood has a slight scent, but I could not myself detect any
odour about the cross. I have never myself worn the cross except, years
ago, on a watch chain, but it was worn by my mother, who gave it to
me, on black velvet. I cannot identify the lady described ; I was expecting
a description of the lady who made the cross (my cousin and godmother), but
none of Nelly's statements apply to her, except the possible connection with
Christopher. When Nelly spoke of an operation, I remembered that my
cousin had died of cancer, but had had no operation, and as I thought this,
Nelly went on to say " not cancer." For the " small thing" which was " got
out " of my mother's foot (not hand), see below (3) and (5).
The statement about the "Parliamentary come down" is wholly unintel
ligible to me. The remark about Helen's work seemed to reflect very
vividly my own feeling at the time. I had come to the sitting straight from
a talk with some one who was teaching my daughter a wholly new subject ;
we had been arranging for some work to be done during my daughter's
holidays, and I was disturbed at this, and afraid that the subject was too
hard and would take too much time from her prol>er work.
(3) Adolphe Lebas is unintelligible to me. The "quilling, and hot-water
bottles," etc., suggested my own mother, so I put a question about the
"operation." Owing to my carelessness as a very young child, a needle
ran into my mother's foot. The incident made a great impression ulwn
me. The needle broke, and part was extracted, some time later, by our
doctor, a red-faced, clean-shaven man. For further details see below (5).
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 227
(4) This question referred to a remark of Nelly's at my first informal
sitting in April 1899. The note made by me on returning home at 11 p.m.,
on April 5th, was as follows :
' "Theodore—not very near— only featuie is that the back of his head at
the top is prominent—does not seem the same age as at first—died at the
ordinary age— 'old Theodore'—doesn't like to talk—reads a lot—sits always
in the same place by the fire—on the right-hand side— opposite an old-
fashioned horse-hair arm-chair—in a place with bars to the windows—and
cows to be seen—was fond of fishing—wears woollen under his waistcoat,
and carpet slippers with animals' heads worked on them."
Later, I added from recollection the words : " Wouldn't wear patent
leather shoes for the Queen—slippers have foxes' heads, or at least some
animals'."
The most recent death among my relatives was that of a cousin, Theodore,
who went out to Australia as a young man, and died there at about seventy
years old. The mention of Theodore recalled to me my personal recollec
tion of him, which is very vivid, as a young man, but I immediately remem
bered that he was an old man when he died. On April 22nd I talked over
with my sister our recollections of this cousin ; she told me that he had been
very melancholy during the last few months of his life, and very silent. We
both remembered something about my having worked wool-work slippers
for him when he went to Australia ; my sister thought she remembered that
there were foxes' heads on the slippers, several small heads, and my father,
when asked, had a vague impression of foxes' heads on slippers as a piece of
childish needlework. I also, on reflexion, recalled that I had bought the
slippers with a pattern ready worked, and had with great labour and much
unpicking, filled in the ground behind them. This was the condition of my
memory when I saw Mrs. Thompson on July 27th, and in the interval
between April 22nd and July 27th, I had not mentioned the subject to
anyone. Mrs. Thompson was not then, and is not now, acquainted with my
father and sister.
It will be noted that on this occasion, without prompting from me, she
added to her first vague connexion of Theodore with carpet slippers that they
had been worked by me, with difficulty, and that I had filled in the canvas,
the heads being already done.
(5) Miss Johnson's notes here have the words, "needle, not crochet hook,
that ran into the lady," and it does not appear certain whether they were to
l»e assigned to Mrs. Thompson, or to me. They were not bracketed, as my
other remarks are, but on the other hand, she believes that I was the speaker.
My own impression is that Nelly said, "It was a needle that ran into the
lady," and that I, recognising this as an important correction of the previous
statement (see above, 3) said to Miss Johnson, " needle, not crochet hook," in
order to be sure that the alteration was noted.
I have a vague recollection of a carriage accident to the doctor
and this is confirmed by my father, who thinks that the doctor broke his
228 Mrs. A. W. Vert-all. [PART
leg. We know of no connexion between the doctor and Linton or
Lynmouth.
The " cakes " and the " mezzo soprano " are not intelligible to me.
(6) Here there appears to be a transition on the part of Nelly from my
mother to my mother-in-law, who is undoubtedly described later on. I did
not detect this at the time, and as the statements made were for the most
part not appropriate to my mother, I was, as will be seen from my remarks,
vainly endeavouring to clear up the situation, till the vivid reproduction of
a facial gesture and the description of the apron, etc., suggested to me that
the old lady now being described was my mother-in-law, who is in no way
connected with the hair cross, which was the only object held by the sensi
tive. I comment in detail on the various points :
My mother-in-law's first child, a boy, died at the age of six weeks ; my
mother never had a son.
My child Helen has only a faint recollection of my mother-in-law, but a
perfectly clear one of my mother.
The remark about the Frenchman is indefinite, but perhaps refers to my
mother.
Dr. Arthur Myers knew my mother very slightly, but my mother-in-law
very fairly well. See below, notes on Sitting 3, No. 7.
Neither lady took any interest in the boat race, though if "Cambridge"
were substituted for " boat race," the remarks would be true of my mother-
in-law.
The description of the cough is appropriate to my mother-in-law, and the
reproduction by the sensitive of a certain way of moving the lips was
startlingly characteristic' of her. The silk apron I have often seen her wear,
and I know, from her, that it had belonged to her mother. It fastened with
an elastic and button round the waist, and the movement of the sensitive's
hands as she went through the action of taking off an apron and folding it
was characteristic. So too was the voice and gesture as she spoke of the
white stockings. My mother-in-law has more than once referred half
apologetically to her preference for white Blockings, which she wore long
after they had ceased to be fashionable. I know of no velvet boots worn by
my mother-in-law ; the mention of them recalled my own mother. (See
comment on Sitting 4, No. 9, Oct. 5, 1899.)
SITTING 3. JULY 28TH, 1899.
At Cambridge ; present, Mrs. Thompson, Miss Johnson, and Mrs. Verrall.
The notes were taken during the sitting by Miss Johnson.
(Mrs. Verrall had brought two objects with her, but did not give Mrs.
Thompson anything till after she had made her first Remark.)

her frock low."
Mrt. V. "True."

Mrs. V. agrees about frock being too low.
Nelly. " It was before she died—a long time."
Nelly. "Can see little baby had like little silk boots—not kid."
J/ra. T. "Yea."
Nelly. "They were coloured (i.e., as she explained, not black) like white
silk—not black— shiny as if made of silk."
Jfrt. V. "Yes."
yelly. " There was tall chair, round back to it, not square one—old lady
made cushion to it—to chair that Helen had."
Mrs. V. "No." •

—when you cut little holes and sew it round—with black leather—black one
side and green the other."
(3) Nelly. " I want to say, not Mrs. Sidgwick, but Nora (i.e. the " Nora "
does not refer to Mrs. Sidgwick) —Waura—Miss Johnson, like Laura."
J/its J. " Yes, Laura."
Nelly (to Mrs. V.) " Was a servant that was good to your mother, but she
called her by her surname, not Laura. Had a gentleman she was very fond
of talking French to, not your husband—he used to wear flat hat, like
Professor Sidgwick would wear—crush hat. Town with very white roads,
like Bath or Cheltenham."
Mrt. V. " Yes, very white roads, I know."
Nelly. "White roads like where Mrs. Myers,—Margaret— Margaret—
Margaret . What does Margaret say ? Stupid, what was it ?"
(4) Nelly. " Seen that some one painted this old lady, and when it was
painted her hair was parted and worn down—got little lace collar and chain
—not like chain that Helen has, but finer."
Mrs. V. " Yes, I can see it in picture if I look."
Nelly. " In picture dress isn't plain surface, but has pattern—wouldn't
know that it was so if you didn't look close."
(5) Mrt. V. "Can you see room it's in?"
Nelly. " Can see bedroom, but can't see picture to fit it. Old lady belonged
to bedroom—it had watered red curtains—alpaca like and flat gimp on—
230 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART
had four legs to it, four high ones—little table beside her bed that fastened
on, in connection with the bed. There was Louie, too, and Philip, not
Louis Philippe, but Philip separate from Louie. They don't seem very
responsive when I go out to meet them ; rather—in fact, quite—a sort of
religious sense (apparently meaning reserved, reticent). Rather straight."
Mrs. V. "Separate? Straight?"
Nelly. " She doesn't realise I'm telling you."
Mrs. V. " Doesn't she ?"
Nelly. "Have to get at her through Helen, told her how Helen had giowu
up into a clever girl, and that seemed to get into her heart."
Mrs. V. " I see."
Nelly. "This old lady sewed little diaper pinafores—weren't very com
fortable—like little apron pinafores—sewing them with great pride, like a
string through- -not pinafore that went round neck."
(6) Xelly. "That lady—the mother, you know—was active; when she
came to be ill, it seemed to worry her. She never took life easily, was
always on the alert—always seemed to arrange things—while people were
thinking what they could do, she did it. Was far-seeing. Seemed to have
clever children—one more musical than you, and one could do sketches in
country —not artist like, but could do sketches—some in existence now, in
exercise book with broken corner. In this house, one of those bureaux with
brass handles and things that pull out at the side—old-fashioned thing.
Globe in this house too, like soda-water globe—like what they make soda
water with. It is an indistinct house, very. Old lady got fur cloak,
circular fur cloak, not evening wrap, but useful sort of cloak."
(7) Xelly. "Old lady can't see you, can't believe that you are here."
Mrs. V. " We often used to talk about such things ; she was very interested
in it."
Nelly. " She was not in this town—like farther away—where was most
stupid old parson—one of those stupid old parsons ! Was a square church,
not a spire. (Pause.) If I could get her to realise you were here, she would
talk freely. I don't worry you, do II"
Mrs. V. " Oh, no."
Nelly. " I only want that lady to say something. She had basket like a
knitting basket, that was like shape of canoe—handle there and there—and
coloured band round it."
Mrs. V. " Yes, I have a sort of recollection of it, I can find out."
Nell;/. " She wore cuffs, like bead cuffs, with beads on ; not stout hand,
but had cuff on, and then it was very nice. Shall you go to mother's house
on 14th September?"
Mrs. V. " Don't know."
Nelly. "Think you'll be somewhere where you'll be able to go."
Mrs. V. " Very likely."
Nelly. " See picture of mother with velvet collar on—like sailor collar—
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 231
mother has no dress with velvet collar on." (This seemed to refer to what
Mrs. Thompson would be wearing on September 14 when Mrs. Verrall went
to see her.) " Bur—Bur—Burfield. No, Bertie. What do you say ) Wants
to know who told my mother that she was dead. Doesn't understand that
mother isn't dead ; she'll get to know. Some of the people seem to realise it
instantly, but she doesn't. She knows Dr. Arthur Myers ; he seems to be
trying to explain to her."
Mrs. V. "She did know him."
Nelly. " She may get it more distinctly now. Lady got plain spectacle
<ase with red marks on, not plain like Miss Johnson's."
(8) Nelly. " Mrs. Verrall, this old lady says she did give Helen a brooch."
Mrs. V. " Don't remember, but daresay she did."
Nelly. " Mrs. Verrall, you are going somewhere north, a norther place,
north of Birmingham ; you'll go there when you don't expect it ; there will
be hesitation. It will be before you go to abroad country."
(9) Nelly. " Have you got somebody in your house with sandy hair ?
Not like Lilian."
Mrs. V. " I was just thinking if it was like Lilian."
Nelly. " More goldified—redified—than mother, but not Lilian."
Mrs. V. "Hair down or up?"
Nelly. "Up -not dark."
Mrs. V. "Is it servant—with cap?"
Netty. " No, not cap—wide hat ; her hands are freckled."
(10) Nelly. " Can't tell you more about old lady. Have you got anything
else ? " (meaning another object).
Mrs. V. "I've got ring—it belonged to a French relation of mine—has
been worn by other people."
Nelly. " Haven't you got anything to do with prim lady ? "
Mrs. V. " No. I'm not sure who prim lady is ; she had not to do with
hair cross." (See Sitting 2, July 27.)
Nelly. "There was first prim lady and her associations; then Mrs. V.'s
mother ; prim lady is not your mother. To-day your mother."
Mrs. V. " There is lady connected with gray hair, but not prim."
Nelly. " She has preciseness—not Puritan."
Mrs. V. " I won't try to make out—will wait for you to tell me."
Nelly. " Sad association with the lady of the necklace all the same. I'm
positive she'll come and make friends with mother, and tell you things
through crystal. Before September 14th mother will write to Mr. Myers
and tell him ; there'll be demonstration about old lady, and that'll be cause
that will bring you. It puzzles her because she didn't know mother—that
makes difficulty. If it was through Mrs. Sidgwick (i.e. with Mrs. Sidgwick
acting as medium), she'd know the form. That's what she promised to do.
Will you come if you can to mother's house ?"
Mrs. V. " Yes, certainly."
232 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART
Comments on the above account of Sitting 3.
(1) When I thought over the statements of July 27th I came to thf
conclusion that at least two definite allusions had been made, to my French
connexion and to my mother-in-law, and so I decided to take with me to the
next sitting on July 28th objects representing both these. Nothing had
been said about my bringing any fresh objects on the morning of July 28th.
Just before going out to see Mrs. Thompson, I asked my daughter for the
coral neglig6 which was given to her by her grandmother during the latter's
last illness, and I took this in a bag. I also wore a ring which had been
given by my French grandfather to his wife. I had my mind fixed on the
idea that if the information of the sensitive were in any way derived from
my mother-in-law she would be sure to think of Helen and her gift, so that
the first remark of Nelly certainly bore directly upon my own thought*,
though the object which she mentioned was not correctly named.
(2) The statements concerning my child's clothes are true. My mother-in-
law did not like the low-necked frocks which the baby wore, and used to
pull up the under vest to cover the baby's bare neck. She also often half-
laughingly remonstrated with me for not letting the child wear the usual
woollen " bootikins." Helen always wore silk shoes and stockings, sometimes
blue, but more often white.
My child had the usual round-backed high chair, but I have no recollection
of any special cushion. I have no remembrance of my mother-in-law doing
embroidery, though no doubt she did, like all her generation.
(3) There was no servant called Laura, nor can the French gentleman Iw
identified. The town in question, Brighton, has very white roads, a constant
source of annoyance to me, and so very distinctive to me of the town.
(4) There is a portrait of my mother-in-law, at her house in Brighton,
which Mrs. Thompson has never entered. The dress is black, but in alternate
stripes of velvet and satin, producing the effect of a pattern if one looks
close. There is a lace collar, and the hair is parted and worn down. There
is no chain in the picture, but my mother-in-law constantly wore a long fine
<jold chain, and I thought at the time that this was shown in the portrait.
Helen has a similar, but less fine, gold chain worn by my mother, and shown
in a portrait of her which is in my father's house.
(5) The curtains in my mother-in-law's bedroom were buff. Philip is not
ii name in either family. The general description that follows seems appro
priate to my mother-in-law, especially the reference to the pleasure that her
grandchild's " cleverness " would give her. No diaper or other pinafore was
made by my mother-in-law for my child, as far as we can remember, but
she did once give the child a Holland pinafore which the nurse thought
clumsy and uncomfortable, and which was only worn when the giver was
likely to see it.
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 233
(6) The general description of the lady is correct ; my husband used to
sketch years ago, but no " exercise book " can be found. There are two
bureaux in the room where my mother-in-law's portrait stands, but no globe.
A gazogene globe stood for many years immediately below the portrait of
my mother. My mother had a circular fur cloak.
(7) Nothing is known of a " stupid parson " ; there was no canoe-shaped
knitting basket, nor plaid spectacle case.i I have seen my mother-ill-law
wearing woollen cuffs with beads worked into them.
The difficulty in getting her to understand the situation, and the necessity
that she should understand before acting, struck me as characteristic. So
did the intervention of Dr. Arthur Myers ; I have often heard him explain
ing to my mother-in-law the work and aims of the S.P.R. and the effect of
certain experiments.
I was in the country on September 14th, and did not see Mrs. Thompson
again till October 5th ; she then wore no velvet or sailor collar. She had
a sailor collar to a dress she was wearing the next autumn, 1900, at the
sitting of September 14th ; this sitting was arranged at very short notice.
A suggestion had been made by Nelly in May, 1900, that Miss Harrison and I
should sit on September 9th, Miss H.'s birthday. This day proved to be a
.Sunday, and so the appointment was made for the nearest day, September
8th. Miss Harrison, however, was not back in England by this date, and I
had a sitting (No. 18) with another sitter. I did not hear till after
the 8th that Miss Harrison was returning on the 13th, and at once arranged
for the first possible day, the 1 4th.
(8) Helen never had a brooch given her by my mother-in-law. I did not
go "North " before my next journey ;< abroad," which was in June, 1900, nor
have I been since.
(9) When Nelly spoke of some one with " sandy hair," I at once thought of
a friend of my daughter's called Lilian, whom she had seen, and she at once
added, " not like Lilian."
There was no one with reddish hair in my house on July 28th. But tin-
next day, when I told my daughter what Nelly had said, she stated that she
had been expecting a visit from a friend who answers to the description ;
having reddish, sandy hair, worn up, uuder a wide hat, and freckled hands.
The girl did not come to the house.

'A relative of Miss Johnson's who had recently died had possessed such a
basket as here described ; also bead cuffs and a plaid spectacle case. •

SITTING 4. OCTOBER STH, 1899.i
At Hampstead ; present, Mrs. Thompson and Mrs. Verrall alone.
The notes were taken in pencil during the sitting, revised in the evening,
and written out the next day. The words in round brackets ( ) wen-
added on writing out, those in square brackets represent explanations or
comments added later. Longer comments will be found after the record
of the sitting.
(1) Nelly, after greeting me, said : " What do I talk to you about ?"—after a
pause—" Helen's brooch." (Mrs. V. said she had brought a brooch received
since seeing Nelly, of which she knew nothing but that it was old.)
Nelly. " Will describe before seeing."
Mrs. V. got up, took out [from bag] brooch in envelope folded down, held
it while Nelly spoke.
Nelly. " There is a stone let in,—it is like an earring,—in the shape of an
earring ; it is connected with the old lady (by this meaning Helen's grand
mother). Give me the brooch."
Mrs. V. took brooch out of envelope and gave it.
Nelly. "There's hair in it—the lady that gave the brooch has got a
Margaret ; I thought Helen had it."
Mrs. V. "No, it has been given since I saw you, given to Helen by an
aunt."
Nelly. " Mrs. Sidgwick seems rather poorly ; you've brought an influence
of Mrs. Sidgwick not being quite well to-day,—not ill. [Not correct.] The
lady that gave the brooch has got a sore throat, a bad cold, either now, just
now or shortly (will have). The lady of the brooch made an apron for the old
lady, I see her embroidering it. Has Helen been painting lately ?—painting
a head—in the hot weather,—something is the matter with her paints in the
hot weather." [Not correct.]
Mrs. V. " I have not heard of it."
Nelly. " Ask Helen, she'll remember."
(2) Nelly. " A lady belonging to you had her breast taken off, —not a
relation,—it was the left breast, then there was something underneath her
arm (some further trouble, I understood). You didn't come on 12th Septem
ber." [See Sitting 2.]
Mrs. V. "On the 14th, it was to be, but I was only to come if it were con
venient, not on purpose, and I was in the country with my husband for his
holiday."
Nelly. " Your husband has headache at the back of his head," touching her
own head.
Mrs. V. " No, I think not."
i This was the least good of all the sittings in which I have taken part, and
must not be regarded as a normal specimen. Mrs. Thompson was in great anxiety
about a friend who had undergone a serious operation on the day of the sitting.
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 235
Netty. " Perhaps he is going to. There's a dead clergyman belonging to
him, lived more North than London. [Not identified.] Why does Mr
Edmund Gurney come ? "
Mn. V. " I knew him."
Nelly. "He's standing behind you,-—he's got a message for you." . . .
Then slowly—" He says your work is to help Mr. Myers in unravelling the
tangled skein he will give you."
Here Nelly reverted to my husband, asked why she kept thinking of him.
I said he was much interested and would be glad to have something said that
I did not know,—that could not be learnt by telepathy from me.
Netty. " There's an old gentleman that stuttered, that your husband knew,
with a James in his name,—an acquaintance." [Not identified.]
(3) Nelly. "The brooch like an earring is the brooch I saw [meaning at
former sitting, No. 3]. The lady belonging to it is not married, she lives in
a house, a country house, not a rich house, back from the road, it's got red
stuff round the bed (I've been there before). They call you May, Mrs.
Myers calls you May (mother has heard her, but it's not the truth), it is
Margaret."
Jirs. V. " Yes, my name is Margaret."
Nelly. " There's one dead person who called you Margaret to your
mother. I see you and Mother talking, and Dr. Hodgson comes in and
speaks to you. [Not fulfilled.] There's another brooch very similar
to this one. The lady of the brooch is fuller in the bust than you ; she
wears a muff with a cord. (Many people do that but) she lately looked
at her muff—this is the lady that's got a Margaret."
Mrt. V. " I don't know which lady you mean. Do you mean the old lady f
Is she the same as the lady of the brooch ?"
Nelly said it was confusing and she was not clear herself, but the old lady
said (here she spoke louder)—" that's Margaret, not May."
(4) Nelly gave me back the brooch and asked for something else if I had
brought (anything). [I told her I had some letters, and got up to fetch them,
They were in a plain envelope inside my bag which was lying on the table
within sight. I was about to take them out of their envelope, when she said]
"No, give me one, only, in the envelope." (I took out one without choosing
and gave her the other, folded inside the envelope. She held it in her right
hand, with some of her fingers inside the envelope. She made no attempt to
take it out, and I watched closely, but could detect no attempt to look at the
contents.)
Nelly. "I wish I was—"
ifn. V. " I don't understand."
Nelly. " ' I am sure '—that's in the letter. It is a lady's letter, she's not
very well, not in good health when she wrote. I associate her with the old
lady who was troubled about Helen's low frocks (see former sitting, 3, No. 2).
There are lots of people trying to talk—there's a stained glass window iu
connexion with the lady."
Q
236 Mrs. A. W. VerraU. [PART
Mrs. V. " I know nothing about that."
Nelly. " Ask the younger lady. The lady is interested in what I am telling
you, but she did not believe it,—she got explanations for things like this,—
she wondered from the Bible."
(Here I think I looked puzzled.) Nelly (said) emphatically that she was
not religious, but it was not the idea of her life to make it the truth.
Nelly. "Yorkshire I seem to go to,—not in connexion with the letter, but
with you, you and your husband go to Yorkshire or Lancashire."
(5) Netty. "The old lady was misunderstood. She was really sympathetic,
but did not show her feelings, was self-contained and misunderstood. The
mother of the lady of the letter lived to be very old,—she had great interest
in you. She was shorter than the lady of the letter."
(6) Nelly. " Margaret's husband looks older than he is—he's only a
stampling (or stapling) over 40, but he looks more. He's talking with a
gentleman who has told him of an accident."
Mrs. V. " Can you describe either of them ? "
Nelly. " One gentleman has a black beard. There's an upset at one of the
colleges— a big one, every one will talk—a misfortune or a scandal—some
thing is going to happen."
(7) Nelly. " I think of gas and a dentist, it's connected with the lady of
the letter—she went with you or you with her (to a dentist). I see you
waiting in a room looking into the street. The letter has been in a drawer
on the left hand side." [Correct.]
(8) Nelly. "Tri-pos"—(this was said slowly in two divisions). "Do you
know what that means : "
Mrs. V. "Yes."
Nelly. " It's something about Helen. She's going to have one.:'
Mrs. V. " Very likely, but not yet."
Nelly. "The old lady will be proud when she sees Helen with it. It's a
kind of examination, same as you, but it's a bit larger and brighter than you."
Mrs. V. " Which old lady ?"
Nelly. " Helen's Greeks or Greece—do you understand ? "
Mrs. V. "Yes."
Netty. " —must not be overdone. Helen's rather enthusiastic, because it's
fresh. Helen's grandmother wants to see your husband alone. (Let him
come but) don't let mother know it's Mr. Verrall."
(9) Nelly. " M r. Gurney says that everything has to be arranged beforehand,
and if Henry we,re to hear him talk, he would be convinced."
Mrs. V. " Who would be convinced and who is to talk ?"
Nelly. " Henry would be convinced (if he heard the old lady talk) ami that
would convince your husband. The old lady could tell Henry better. You
see the actual belonging is better than when it's married. Henry belongs"
xuv.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 237
[these two words] with great emphasis. " Don't laugh, but I think of apple
dumplings with the lady of the letter."
Mrt. V. " Can you tell me who all these ladies are ? "
Nelly (with great decision). "The ladyof the letter is the lady of the velvet
boots—quite distinct from the grandmother who did not like the low necks.
The brooch belongs to Helen's grandmother, Henry belongs to her."
Comment on above account of Sitting 4.
(1) I took with me to this sitting a brooch that had recently been given to
my daughter by an aunt, the daughter of the " grandmother " who had been
said in Sitting 3 to have given a brooch. The brooch was of an old-
fashioned design, and had, I knew, come from some other owner to the aunt,
but neither my daughter nor I knew who that previous owner was. The
brooch is in the shape of a gold knot and pendant locket, with blue enamel
and pearl, and there is hair in the pendant. At the time of the sitting
I knew that my daughter and a cousin had been given this brooch and a
ring by their aunt, and that the cousin, being the elder, had chosen the ring.
It will be seen that Nelly gave a correct description of the brooch before
she saw it, while I held it in a folded envelope ; there is a stone let in, and
the brooch is in the shape of an earring.
The "lady of the brooch" is too indefinite a phrase for identification ; it
might describe (1) the aunt who gave it, (2) the lady from whom she
received it. This lady who, as I subsequently found, was not a relative, has
been dead some years. The giver of the brooch had had no recent sore throat.
For further remarks about the brooch, see below on 3.
(2) A friend of mine, not a relative, had had the operation described in
the summer of 1899. I did not at the time know which side had been
operated on, but found on enquiry that it was the left. She had made a
very fair recovery at the time of the sitting, but there has been further
trouble since.i
(3) For the red stuff round the bed, see comment on Sitting 3.
My name is Margaret, and I always use Margaret in my signature, but no
one calls me by that name. My grandmother (father's mother) used to call
me "Margaret" to me and to my mother, as she thought the name "May"
foolish.
When I told my daughter of Nelly's statement about the similar brooch
she said that was so, and that the reason why the cousin chose the ring and
not the brooch was that she already possessed a brooch in design precisely
like the one in question, but with garnets for its decoration. The brooch
has no connexion with any member of our family.
i For obvious reasons I am unable to give details here, but I may state that the
subject was introduced again at the next sitting by Nelly, in connexion with the
name of a lady who is a common friend of myself and the lady who had been ill,
and that on this occasion Nelly repeated the suggestion of further suffering, and
coupled it with a Christian name, closely resembling that of the invalid lady.
238 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART
(4) The two letters which I had taken were from my mother to me, dated
20th and 23rd October, 1876. They were selected by me on the day before
the sitting, from a packet of letters kept in a cardboard box in my husband's
study. The particular parcel from which these letters came had been in the
box only a few hours ; since 1894 they had been in the left-hand drawer of
my table in the study, and before that for many years they had been in
an old-fashioned writing desk. I selected these two out of several of about
the same date, written by my mother on her return to Brighton from
Cambridge in October, 1876. She was not well at Cambridge, and was ill
when she reached home. I did not know which of the two letters I had
given to Mrs. Thompson.
Thus it is true that the lady who wrote was not in good health ; the only
allusion to the writer's health was in the inner pages, which Mrs. Thompson
could not possibly have seen.
The words " I am sure " occur in the letter, on the outside sheet, at the
bottom of the envelope, upside down. They must have been touched by
Mrs. Thompson's fingers, but they could not have been seen unless the
envelope had been partly opened. I saw no attempt to do thia, and she
certainly did not bring the envelope near her other hand.
The remarks about the " lady " are unintelligible, and I do not know to
what lady they were supposed to apply.
My husband and I have not been to Yorkshire or Lancashire since
1896.
(5) My mother's mother was, I think, 87 when she died. She lived in the
house with us as children and was very fond of us. She was less tall than
my mother.
(6) My husband was 48. Nothing is known of the misfortune or scandal ;
my husband had no talk with any friend during the sitting.
(7) Naturally my mother accompanied me to a dentist more than once
during my childhood.
(8) It was not true that Greek was fresh to my daughter. She was
learning a new subject, but it was not Greek (see Sitting 2, No. 2).
(9) Henry is the name of my husband's father. There seems here a con
fusion between my mother and my mother-in-law. Nelly seemed to think
that Henry was more closely connected with the lady than was my husband,
but yet, on being asked to distinguish, she rightly separated the lady of the
velvet boots (my mother) from the other grandmother who did not like the
low frocks, to whom she assigned the brooch (see Sittings 2 and 3), and
to whom Henry "belongs."
5 AND 6. MESSAGES CONNECTED wirn SITTINGS.
(5) October 10, 1899. —Message heard by Mrs. Thompson when hold
ing a shell to her ear, and sent by her to one of her sitters, who sent it
on to me. The message was sent by Mrs. Thompson on October 10, 1899.
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 239
" Tell Mrs. Verrall the old lady who was cross about Helen's low-necked
frocks and sleeves tied up is just like Arthur Willgar—that means she
cannot believe I am really telling through my mother things belonging to
our house, but I am going to work very hard to make her understand, then
Mr. Willgar will understand too—he does understand worse difficulties ; the
old lady says she will try to know about it."
(6) October 20, 1899.—Note of statement made by Nelly in a sitting
on October 20 when I was not present, and sent to me by the sitter on
October 21, 1899.
Nelly says (not a propos of Mrs. Verrall):
"Arthur Willgar has a dark beard—not healthy looking—a bit livery
under the eyes—I see him walking on the old Chain Pier at Brighton
shortly before it was blown away. I don't think he's married, but he has a
Helen belonging to him."
Comment on above account of Messages 5 and 6.
The lady in question, my husband's mother (see earlier sittings), had been
a Miss Woollgar ; my husband's baptismal names are Arthur Woollgar.
The description given is correct. The old chain pier at Brighton is close
to my father-in-law's house, and my husband has often been on it : it is one
of his most marked associations with Brighton.
This is the first appearance of my husband's names, and of Brighton in
connexion with him. The error in the second name (Willgar for Woollgar)
is rather that of imperfect hearing than of imperfect vision ; it may be
noted in this connexion that the message was said by Mrs. Thompson
to have been heard in a shell. Nelly continued throughout to use the
wrong pronunciation, Willgar.
SITTING 7. NOVEMBER 2ND, 1899.
At Hampstead ; present, Mrs. Thompson and Mrs. Verrall alone. Notes
as for Sitting 4.
Nelly. " Have you brought a letter 1 "
Mrs. V. "No."
(Mrs. V. gave a glove.)
(1) Nelly. "This belongs to a gentleman with a Mary Elizabeth. Mary
Elizabeth knew him as a little boy. This gentleman is not so well the last
week or two. He used to ride a bicycle when it was high, now he rides it
when it is low. When on the high bicycle he had an accident to his
shoulder."
Mrs. F. "Which shoulder?"
Nelly. "It was not broken ; it was, I think, the left shoulder. He fell on
it. He wore a Tam o' Shanter hat or a round cap, not a cap with a peak (on
the high bicycle).
" Is it Mary or Marian 1 They say Mary Elizabeth. The glove belongs

to a man who writes books more than he ought ; let his mind have a rest.
He has a Henry,—not his son "—said as if puzzled—" but he says ' My son
Henry.' I don't know. Under his eyes he's a bit riugy, this last week or
two. He's like as if a Greek man ; yet he seems English. If he were not
English, he would be Greek. He seems not to preach, but like preaching ;
he doesn't preach, but he preaches too much ; he preaches in black but uot
in white"—mysteriously, "There's something wrong with his health* Mrs.
Cartwright said : I don't like his health if his name is Willgar."
Mrs. V. ' How do you spell Willgar?"
Nelly. " W-I-L-L-G-A-R. He has not had outdoor exercise enough
lately ; his work is not bad for him, if he could take exercise. He will
perhaps be deaf. Mrs. Cartwright sends all this, says every word ; she feels
sure that he will be a little deaf, he will not lose his eyesight, but slight
deafness, that failure will be his weakness. He used to be fond of boating.
Not at Cambridge, but on rough water ; it was not a hobby. He wri'es not
interesting books, Ijooks that they can't do without, but not to give people
at Christmas. He knows Mr. Edmund Gurney."
Mrs. V. "Yes."
Nelly. " He met him not at Cambridge, somewhere besides Cambridge.
Mr. Willgar is at Cambridge now ; I see him in a room with wooden walls,
not paper, with red dining-room chairs in it, in a big church place, with red
chairs and oak in it."
(2) Selly. "Merrifield, Merriman, Merrythought, Merrifield ; there was
an old lady named one of those, that did not believe any more than Mr.
Willgar. She loves you, she is in your surroundings, but wants to convince
Mr. Willgar. I can't see that he's married, but he's got a Helen."
(3) Nelly. " There's a little boy at our house, he would have been about
eleven, he's a bit larger than Rosie, he never talked, he's dead with you, but
he's not dead in our world. Little Arthur, he's not got a name, I call him
that. Mrs. Cartwright says : ' He's a little Arthur.' "
(4) Nelly. " Mr. Willgar has a very dark grey overcoat, I think there's a
ticket not given up in the pocket of the overcoat. You go and knock at dis
door and ask ; tell him you are a S.P.R. researcher and he'll excuse it.
There's a Margaret belonging to him. Margaret has got a Henry, not a son,
wait" . . .—after a pause—"Margaret belongs to a man that has got a
Henry. Mr. Willgar's name,—it is not Professor Barrett, but it seems as
if it had the same sort of letters as Professsor Barrett. There's an old gen-
tleuian, an old lawyer gentleman, belongs to Mr. Willgar. He's very old
now."
Jfn. V. " Is he in your house?"
Nelly. " No [with great emphasis], quite alive. He's not a lawyer that
wraps up paper''—(here she went through the action of) rolling papers
together—" and has a wig on. Have you brought something of Helen's ? "
i A particular organ was mentioned as " wrong " ; this is not correct.
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 241
Mrs. V. " No, I have brought nothing but the glove."
Nelly. " I heard you tell mother she wasn't very well, I was not far off.
Mr. Willgar has got somebody belonging to him who had an operation . . ."
(Digression, omitted from report.) " Mr. Willgar's not going to be ill ; there's
a leather couch like a sofa in the room where he works, I am sure some
thing will come to hia health i if he does not lie down more. He will laugh
when you tell him about his health.i "
Mrs. V. " Yes, I think he will."
Nelly. " He is not to laugh about it. He has dark whiskers and beard,
his face is rather pale, a creamy colour, his hair is brushed up, like this."
(Here she pushed her hair back from her forehead, saying, " Back off the
brow," by which I understood her to mean that the hair was not brushed
erect.)
Nelly. " He's not a man with a large love for outside people ; he's satisfied
with his own people ; not keen on relations, not a great man for looking up
his relations, he would rather have a good strong book than people to talk."
Mrs. V. "Can you tell me about him when he was younger, or about his
friends?"
Nelly. " He used to be at the seaside, this Mr. Willgar. It is funny for
the seaside, it looks such a 'house-ified' place, it's ah ungreen seaside. When
he was there it was a fishing place, not like a nigger seaside; it seems to have
developed. He was associated with Worthing when he was a very young
boy, he had cause to go there. The ungreen seaside place is not Worthing.
He used to see some one at Worthing. There's an old Mary belonging to
him."
Mrs. V. " In your house or ours ? "
Nelly. " In our house, a dead lady. She died at a seaside place. She had
a thin neck, the lady was rather stout, she shows me her neck. She wore
Honitou lace collars. Henry comes with everybody, he comes with this old
lady. With that old lady I get Mary Gloucester. Mr. Willgar is not fifty
yet, perhaps he will not laugh so much at the health troublei when he is
fifty."
(5) Mrs. V. " Have you anything to tell me about Helen's grandmother ?
She promised to communicate if she could."
Netty. "I said you were coming at two, she would communicate if she
could. I have not seen her. Mrs. Merrythought, that's not quite right, it's
like the name of a garden."
Mrt. V. " I know the name you mean, but I won't tell you."
Nelly. " Think of it and see if I can find it."
(I fixed my attention on the name Merrifield; after a minute Nelly said :)
Nelly. " No, I am muddled. I will tell you how names come to us. It's
like a picture, I see school children enjoying themselves ; you can't say
Merrymans, because that's not a name, nor Merry people. Mr. Willgar's got
no brothers that I can see, he has a sister ; she ought to be married, she's

quite large enough. But what would the poor old lawyer do '? Have you
come for nothing, all this way to Mother's house ?"
Mrs. V. " No, everything that you have said ia right."
Nelly. " I see Mr. Willgar in a big church preaching a service for men
only. He's got a voice more powerful than his physique ; his voice is very
telling, it is heard quite at the back of the room. [Correct.] You invite Mr.
Willgar to come (at my own house) [where Mrs. Thompson was coming to
stay], old Mary might like to talk. There's rather a breathing,"—(she
touched her side ; I understood her to be) referring to " old Mary."
(6) Nelly. "Now this is not for Mr. Willgar, but for you. I see you
doing something with a lot of papers, thinking it over, not correcting exam
ination papers, it's something for yourself. It's a large bundle, you turned
it over."
[Here followed some statements, which I here omit ; the statements were
in the main correct ; some referred to the lady who had had an operation as
described above, Sitting 4, No. 2].
(7) Nelly. " Mother said, Don't you tell Mrs. Verrall she's got a sister
Flora, because it's in the book to-day ; Mother saw it." [Digression on the
subject of the death watch.]
Mrs. V. " Can you tell me something else about my sister, besides her
name ? "
Nelly. " She is not married ; she lives in a country house—not in Cam
bridge, further from London than Cambridge is. I can't tell you any more.
Put away the glove, don't let Mother see it. Flora gave you a bag for your
birthday, it's greener than that one." (I had [brought the glove in] a leather
bag.) " It's not green, it's a small bag, a little pocket outside, a little hand
kerchief bag. You had an uncle that died. It was not long after that.
You have got a servant with fair hair [not correct] ; she's not been well in
her head, not mad, but lackadaisical, limp [not correct]. Oh ! I am talking
nonsense—I had better go."
Comment on Sitting 7.
(1) To this sitting I brought nothing but a glove of my husband's;
I was anxious to see whether Nelly would be able (1) to give information
about the owner, (2) to identify him as my husband, (3) to identify him as
the " Arthur Willgar " of the above messages. My husband had two aunts
called Mary and Elizabeth ; his j ounger sister was called after them, but the
name Marian was given instead of Mary, as there were other Marys in the
family. This lady is a member of the S.P.R., and her initials M. E., but not
her full name, appear in the list of members and associates.
It is true that my husband rode a high bicycle from about 1877 to 1883,
very seldom after his marriage in 1S82. He also rode a low bicycle from
about 1894 to 1900. So far as he knows, he never had an accident to his
shoulder when bicycling, but in July, 1899, 4 months before this sitting, a
doctor treating him for rheumatism said that there had been an old strain
XLIV.] Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Thompson. 243
to one of his shoulders, probably due to an accident, perhaps a fall. My
husband had mentioned this to me, but neither of us could recall any
accident. I did not at the time of the sitting know which shoulder showed
the old strain ; my husband is not sure, but thinks it was the right.
Nothing is known of the cap described.
Henry is the name of my husband's father (see note on Sitting 4, No. 9).
My husband lectures on classical subjects at Cambridge, and wears of course
a black gown ; he was suffering from rheumatism at the time of the sitting,
and exercise was naturally a difficulty. He has never been fond of boating,
he does write books, and he did know Mr. Gurney, not only at Cambridge ;
he used to see him at Brighton as well as at Cambridge, and stayed with
him in Ireland at the house of a common friend.
The description of the room with wooden walls, etc., suggests the hall at
Trinity, which is shown to visitors, and is likely to have been seen by Mrs.
Thompson when she stayed in Cambridge in July, 1899.
(2) My unmarried name was Merrifield ; my mother was not interested
in the work of the S.P.R.
Helen is the name of our only child ; it will be seen that the name of
Willgar has been used of the owner of the glove, and that he is seen to be
connected with my maiden name, unknown as far as I know to Mrs. Thomp
son, and with my child's Christian name, certainly known to Mrs. Thompson.
(3) My second child, a girl, was born in September, 1888, and would
therefore have been eleven years old. She died before learning to speak.
It may be of interest in this connexion to note that an aunt of my husband's
—who seems to be referred to later in this sitting (see below, No. 4)—always
spoke of the nephews' children by their father's name as " little Arthurs,'i
"little Toms," etc.
(4) My husband had a dark gray overcoat, but there was no ticket in the
pocket when I looked on my return to Cambridge.
These remarks seem to show a further step in the identification of " Mr.
Willgar." My name is Margaret ; and Verrall and Barrett are certainly
names of analogous type. My husband's father Henry is a solicitor. He
was 82 at the time of the sitting, and still holding the office of Clerk to the
Magistrates.
The remark about my daughter's health had been made by me to Mrs.
Thompson during lunch.
There is in my husband's study a couch, of leather stretched on a wooden
framework, with stuffed cushions over it. Mrs. Thompson had never been
in my house ; she entered it for the first time on December 4th, 1899,
when she came to stay with me.
The general description seems appropriate. Brighton has developed
greatly within my husband's recollection. He has no associations with
Worthing. An aunt, Mary, a stout lady, lived at Gloucester Place, Brighton,
when he was a child. This lady is dead.
244 Mrs. A. W. Verratt. [PART
(5) My husband has two unmarried sisters living with his father. Here
appears the definite recognition that the old lawyer Henry is "Mr. Willgar's"
father.
(6) I had been occupied during two or three days before going to town for
the sitting in correcting for press the proofs of a book.
(7) By the " book," Nelly meant the S.P.R. Journal for November, which
contained an account by me of a hallucinatory ticking, in which my sister's
name was mentioned.
My sister is unmarried, and lives in Brighton.
When Nelly spoke of a bag, I tried to remember what bags I had. The
first suggested was a small yellowish or greenish cloth workbag, which was
the last birthday present given me by my mother, and had been bought by
my sister as my mother could not go out : the only other small bag is a little
leather handbag left in my house by a cousin of mine and annexed by me.
My uncle, this cousin's father, the only uncle I have known, died 15 or 16
years ago.

Nouvettes Observations sur un cas de Somnambulisme avec glossolalie. By
TH. FLOURNOY (Extrait des Archives de Psychologie de la Suisse Romande,
Vol. I., No. 2, p. 101-255, Geneva, 1902.)
The readers of these Proceedings will remember the account which Mr.
Myers gave in Part XXXVIII. (Vol. xv., pp. 395-415) of a remarkable
case of " Pseudo-possession," to wit, the observations by Professor Flournoy on
the mediumship of " Mlle. Helene Smith " in his book Des Indes a la planhe
3fars. The present article is the continuation of the observations there
given, and indeed, as far as Professor Flournoy is concerned, probably its
conclusion. For the great success of his book directed so much attention
to "Mile. Smith" that a wealthy American lady came to see her, was
convinced of the spiritist interpretation of her phenomena, and endowed
her so generously that she can now devote herself entirely to the cultivation
of her psychic gifts. The example thus set is a notable one and may
perhaps be found to indicate the right solution of the difficult problem
of how to extend social support to the curious personalities, whom, for lack
of a better name, we call "mediums" or "psychics." That in the abstract
they deserve such support may be admitted. They are exceedingly rare,
rarer probably than opera singers. And they are psychologically very
interesting, more so perhaps than psychology professors, who at all events
are common enough. If then we endow psychologists, why should we
not endow "mediums" for them to study? That the current methods of
paying them, practically "by results," are crude and unsatisfactory is admitted
on all hands. They maximize the temptations to fraud and overwork, and
minimize the opportunities for systematic study. Nor can any real advance
ment be hoped for from unpaid amateurs. For amateur work, though it
may be good enough to start with, also puts obstacles of its own in the
experimenter's way and is too capricious aud inefficient to serve in the long
rnn. Hence it will be interesting to watch the effect of the experiment
made with " Mlle. Smith."
Not that too much must be expected of a first experiment. Indeed the
auguries are not all favourable scientifically. For apparently one of the
results of the improvement in "Mlle. Smith's" position has been a com
246 F. C. S. Schiller. [PART
plete rupture with Professor Flournoy. The publication of his book, he tells
us, severely strained their relations, partly because " Mlle. Smith " then for
the first time realized how completely the case for a spiritist interpretation
of her phenomena was explained away by the professor, and partly because
she conceived herself to be " insulted " by the ordinary ignorance and flip
pancy of the newspaper reviews. In view of the fact that only Professor
Flournoy's strong testimony to her integrity rendered remarkable many
of her performances which could easily have been simulated by fraud, the
critics' insinuations should not, perhaps, have been regarded as unnatural.
When, however, "Mile. Smith" realized that these were only the draw
backs to fame, this phase of estrangement seems to have worn off. Then
came her benefactress and carried her over wholly into the spiritist
camp.
Now that personally a medium should prefer the spiritist interpretation
is natural enough. It is ever so much more flattering to be regarded
as communicating with the spirits of the departed than to be con
sidered subject to fits of " somnambulism with glossolaly." And in " Mile.
Smith's" case, the spiritist interpretation was unusually romantic. To
reduce the ex-Ranee Simandini of Chandraghiri, the ex-Queen of France,
the protegee of discarnate Cagliostro, the recipient of telepathic communi
cations from trusty correspondents throughout the solar system, to a mere
dreamer of dreams constructed by an ill-regulated sub-consciousness must
be painful to the least sensitive vanity, and it is not in the least surprising
that Professor Flournoy should have to confess (p. 115) that " Mlle. Smith"
is now " profoundly irritated against science and the scientists and only
desires to have nothing more to do with professors." Similar feelings are
widely spread among spiritists and even among the general public, and
their growth is not wholly unreasonable. But "Mlle. Smith" would
nevertheless do well to remember that there are professors and professors,
and that in M. Flouruoy she has had to do with one of the most sincere and
open-minded of the tribe. She should remember also that her own fame
and importance in the world at large rest almost wholly upon his testi
mony, and that there is nothing to show that her present friends are willing
or able to keep such a record of her performances as will have the slightest
influence on the judgment of reasonable men.
At present, then, the case stands and falls with Professor Flouruoy's
account of it, even though it is professedly more imperfect as a record of
her later developments than of her earlier exhibitions. Judging by the
material which was accessible to him, Professor Klouruoy decides that
nothing substantially new has been produced, and (charitably) supposes
that this may have been due to the influence of his own " suggestion " and
that in different surroundings "Mile. Smith's" mediumship may develop
in new directions. Consequently his chapters on " Leopold " the " spirit-
guide," on the " planetary " languages, on the Indian pre-existence, and on
the " royal cycle " are composed of replies to criticisms and supplementary
chronicles and explanations.
XLIV.] Review. 247
To take these remarks in order. In the chapter on " Leopold," Professor
Flournoy relates several further instances of useful warnings, which he
interprets as sub-conscious inferences, and so long as it is impossible to
assign any limits to the powers of this aubliminal consciousness, it is clear
that nothing of this sort, however surprising, can be affirmed to lie beyond
their scope.
Under the head of planetary wanderings, there seems at first more to
mention. Professor Flournoy quotes extensively from the elaborate philo
logical study of the "Martian" (pseudo-) language by Professor Victor
Henry of Paris, which gives a (conjectural) derivation of almost the whole
of its vocabulary. " Ultramartian," which had just begun to appear in
Det Indes, has received a further development. Professor Flournoy gives
specimens not only of the language (distinguished by the preponderance
of K and P and T), but of the writing (composed of ideograms—in accord
ance with the backward condition of this ill-starred planet), and of the
scenery. These latter illustrations appeal not only to the eye, but also to
the sense of the ludicrous (especially the " Ultramartian " sheep (dog?) on
p. 160), but on the whole these pictures are simply childish. In addition we
are afforded a glimpse of " Uranian " (language and script), which is remark
able for its preference for A, O, L and T, and hear rumours of several
"Lunar" languages—as to the authenticity of which Mr. H. G. Wells does
not yet seem to have been consulted.
The new material with regard to the Hindu pre-existence of " Mlle.
Smith" consists almost wholly of descriptions of visions, and adds nothing
verifiable to the historical data previously given. On the other hand, the
internal contradictions of the story, regarded as history, come into stronger
relief. Thus the Sanscrit experts all agree that the trance-utterances are
solely Sanscrit imperfectly reproduced, but without admixture of other
tongues ; that Indian women, neither at the time alleged (1401) nor at
any other, spoke Sanscrit ; that the language of the place alleged (Kanara)
was, and is, Dravidian, and utterly different from Sanscrit ; that it is
incredible that a Mussulman Arab chief would marry his daughter to a
Hindu prince practising suttee. And Professor Macdonell's acute remark
that the phrases attributed to Simandini looked very like examples from
a Sanscrit grammar, looks rather lurid in the light of the discovery (p.
212) that one of the spiritist friends of " Mlle. Smith," in whose study
she often gave seances, had in this very room a Sanscrit grammar con
taining some of the most characteristic words used by " Mile. Smith " '
As against all this, the apparent authenticity of the Hindu song (Det Indes,
p. 301-2) can hardly be said to weigh seriously.
Of the " Royal Cycle," Professor Flournoy is not able to give many
additional rehearsals, although he has heard that when "Mlle. Smith"
was taken to Paris, " reminiscences " of her life as Marie-Antoinette came
upon her with great force. An episode which he does describe, with the
" control " by Dr. Barthez, the physician of the Due d'Orlfians (not of
Philippe-Egalite, however, but of his father), seems to suffer from serious
248 F. C. S. Schiller. [PART
historical anachronisms, and there is no similarity between his authentic
handwriting and that produced by " Mlle. Smith."
Some further remarks on the Burnier-Chaumontet signatures, which in
their way seemed perhaps the most striking evidence in favour of a
spiritist interpretation produced by " Mlle. Smith," tend considerably
to diminish the difficulty of explaining them by latent memory, while
there has been no multiplication of similar feats to tell on the other side.
On the whole, therefore, it is not surprising that Professor Flournoy
should find that he has nothing to retract and little to add to his previ
ously-expressed judgment ou his subject, and that he continues to regard
the case of " Mlle. Smith " as decidedly on a lower plane of scientific
interest from those of Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Thompson (p. 252). Adherents
of the S.P.R. will read with pleasure and approval his concluding remarks
(p. 254) on the deplorable chasm which exists between the " orthodox "
psychologists, who are devoid of interest in supernormal phenomena, and
the enthusiasts who have the desire to know, but are devoid of all
scientific method, and on the services of the S.P.R. in attempting to
bridge this chasm.
II.
I have so far aimed only at reproducing Professor Flournoy's conclusions
concerning what all who are interested in Psychical Research must feel he
has, by his care, lucidity and candour, made an epoch-making case. But for
this very reason it seems appropriate to improve the occasion to discuss, by
way of criticism, or perhaps in lieu thereof, some of the general issues he
has raised.
(1) lu the first place there is the question of whether he did well to reject
the spiritist interpretation so decisively. It is not that I would dispute that
on the evidence of this case he is fully entitled to do so. But the history of
science is full of examples of incompatible theories, each of which, iu
the given state of knowledge, seemed to supply alternative explanations of
the facts of nearly equal value. And though in his last chapter Pro
fessor Flournoy shows that he possesses the true logical doctrine with
regard to the investigation of anomalous facts, one sometimes feels that
somewhat less confidence in hazarding anti-spiritist explanations would not
have been unbecoming. He sometimes seems almost to forget what a big
hypothesis, what an asylum, ignorantiae, the subliminal consciousness still is.
I cannot feel that there is so much to choose between it and spiritism as
Professor Flournoy supposes. He regards the latter as an explanation ignoti
per ignotiw (p. 130)—as indeed it has often been taken to be, not
only by spiritists. But in reality the appeal to spirits, though it may
be perverted into a pseudo-explanation, is intrinsically an appeal to per
sonal being* with motives and minds acting analogously to our own
and pro tanto knowable, and calculated, roughly, to render knowable
the phenomena it deals with, while as soon as we sink below the level
of clear consciousness, we enter a land of darkness where all analogies
xi.iv.J Review. 249
fail us and where anything may happen. This has always been the
secret reason why academic psychology has fought so shy of anything
that savours of the " unconscious " : and so, if I were an " orthodox "
psychologist, I should find it hard to choose between two equally distasteful
theories. But I am sure that a "subliminal self" capable of the astounding
retentivenessand marvellous creativeness which Professor Flournoy demands
for " Mlle. Smith's" would be quite as efficient in destroying my "dogmatic
torpor" as the boldest extravagances of spiritism. But as I do not feel
pledged to the glib application of a few trite psychological formulas as the a
priori explanation of all the facts that await investigation, I prefer to preserve
an open mind with regard to any explanation that may be propounded, and
to leave myself free to hold that the truth will probably turn out to be far
greater and more complicated than is as yet anticipated by the rival theorists.
In other words, there does not seem to be any pressing need at present to
come to a decision ; we may hold any theory of these perplexing phenomena,
if we do so in a tentative and methodological sense, and may use the rivalry
of the conflicting theories with a view to sharpening our observation of the
facts.
(2) And this brings me to my second point, viz., whether Professor
Flournoy has done full justice to the methodological advantages of spiritism
as a •working theory. The present case seems to show that the triumph of
the scientific explanation (allowing the subconscious self theory to be more
scientific) can be overdone in practice. For it is evidently a mistake to
alienate one's subject, and it is conceivable (though not perhaps very
probable) that if Professor Flournoy had contented himself with a less
complete " explanation " of " Mlle. Smith's " performances, he might still be
permitted to observe her developments. But quite apart from such personal
questions, it seems possible that the spiritist interpretation is per se more
stimulating and encouraging, and therefore more likely to bring out the full
powers of the " medium." It is naturally depressing to be told that you
are an ill-balanced person, whose normal life is perturbed by irruptions of
subliminal abnormality ; it is inspiriting to hold that you are a chosen
channel of communication with other worlds. Whatever, therefore, the
nature of the phenomena may ultimately turn out to be, it seems probable
that the latter interpretation will make the most of them, and will
actually produce more of them ; and this would eeem to be one of the
elements of truth in the constant insistence on " faith " as a condition of
success in such investigations.
Translated from the concrete into terms of abstract logic, the point in
dicated seems to be the possibility of a divergence between the methods of
proof and of ditcovery. Proof consists in the progressive assimilation of the
new truth by the old, in the establishment of their connexion and systematic
coherence. But it does not follow that we shall also discover most by always
insisting on this, and by never advancing beyond what can be strictly
" proved." The discoverer, in other sciences as well as in geography, may
have to be like an explorer of a terra incognita, who must push ahead by
250 F. C. S. Schiller. [PART
whatever means are handy. In so doing, he doubtless must run risks and
often cut himself adrift from his base in established principles. He has "faith,"
of course, that his communications can ultimately be restored, but his proxi
mate aim is the discovery of novelty, and not its digestion. He should
be more solicitous, therefore, not to let anything new escape him, than to
secure his retreat into the cosmos which science has already set up. In this
manner, then, it may be methodologically expedient to use hypotheses whose
ultimate validity may appear very doubtful. Whether, on that account,
" Mile. Smith " will do better under exclusively spiritist auspices remains to
be seen. For while the "faith" of her spiritist friends in the possibility
of obtaining the sort of evidence they demand may render its production
possible, by stimulating the medium, or in other as yet unknown ways,
no amount of " faith " can by itself be a substitute for trustworthy recording
and intelligent experimentation, and it seems too probable that the oppor
tunities of obtaining further instruction from "Mlle. Smith" will be thrown
away, unless she comes once more under the supervision of a sympathetic
expert of the type, say, of Dr. Hodgson.
(3) The next issue to raise is perhaps that of whether, in point of fact, Pro
fessor Flournoy has completely explained " Mlle. Smith's " case on his theory.
He appears to think that he has, and with two reservations I should agree
with him. The first reservation, as I have already indicated, ia that the
facts are at present in such a condition that, like every growing science,
Psychical Research admits of a good deal of indetermination, and a number
of theories may apparently cover the facts, while nevertheless, they may all
be wrong or very partially right. The second is that even though " Mlle.
Smith's " performances are all built up out of her (subliminal) memories, yet
the construction out of these of coherent "dreams" requires a principle of
selection.i No doubt we are all familiar with the operation of such a
principle in ordinary dreams ; but then the psychology of dreams stands
itself badly in need of an elucidation which it would, no doubt, long ago
have received but for the psychologists' horror of what seemed abnor
mal and of no great practical importance. And it is further remarkable
that this " selecting principle ''should always mimic with such extraordinary
closeness "proofs" of spiritism (and in this case of reincarnation). This one
might be tempted to explain as due to the greater interest of the spiritist
interpretation alluded to above, were it not that the phenomenon persistently
occurs also in cases where the "medium " rejects that interpretation.2 If I
were concerned, therefore, to bolster up the spiritist view, I should suggest
that the facts looked as though an intelligence were at work that was
desirous of conveying the impression of coming from another world, but yet,
as a rule, found itself unable to express anything but what had once passed
i Professor Flournoy just touches on this difficulty (top of p. 243).
'E.g. in Mrs. Piper's case, and in a case of automatic writing in which my
brother, Mr. F. N. Schiller, acted as "medium."—See Proceedings, vol. iv.,
p. 216.
XLIV.] Review. 251
through the medium's mind, and therefore was reduced to ransacking
it for the most improbable and recondite memories, in order to simulate
an extramundane origiii. And such a procedure might perhaps even be
made to seem pardonable and psychologically plausible in a "spirit" seek
ing to express its continued identity under the restrictions of an alien
organism.
(4) And this again suggests the final reflection that very little has really
been done in the spiritist camp in the way of psychological elaboration of
their working principle. One cannot read Professor Flournoy's replies to
the spiritist criticisms of his book without being greatly struck by the
argumentative weakness of the latter.
The fact seems to be that spiritists as yet have hardly a notion of the
resources which modern psychology and philosophy may yield them for
the defence of their favourite thesis, and do not realize how hollow is the
ground on which the "scientific" materialism of their opponents stands.
Materialism has the support (broadly) of our existing academic personnel, of
the customary ways of common-sense, and of the inertia which shrinks
from translating speculation into experimentation. But all these things are
capable of being altered, if a really strong and genuine desire to know can
be aroused with regard to these subjects.
But when it is and when the spiritist theory is advocated by one who
really kiiows where the land lies, it is safe to say that no one will be blind
to the absurdity of taking " Mlle. Smith's " " planetary " excursions literally.
For the notion of a relation between our world and an " other," which should
take the form of one in physical space (i.e. in the space of our world), will
then be seen to possess precisely the same crudeness as the ancients' fancy,
that by descending the crater of Avernus one might go straight to the
house of Hades, and that by sailing westwards beyond the Pillars of
Hercules one might reach the Islands of the Blest.
From the very nature of the case, the relation between two worlds (i.e.
modes of experience) must be of a psychological order. The alleged
" other " world cannot lie north, east, west, or south of ours. It must be a
state of consciousness, or a mode of experience, into which we pass from
that constituting our " world," and from which we can, perhaps, repass. In
comprehending its relation to ours, therefore, the guiding analogies must be
psychological. In other words, the relation must be conceived as analogous
to that of a " dream " world to a " real " world,—without, of course, pre
judging the question of which is to be regarded as the " reality " and which
as the " dream." That question can only be decided by the comparison of the
contents of the two " worlds," and (since we ex hypothesi start from our
world) by the value of the revelations of the " other " world for our life.
Judged by such canons, the grotesque and unmeaning childishness of
"Mlle. Smith's" planetary dreams will at once settle their interpretation,
and dispose of them without any superfluous censure of the poverty of
scientific imagination and the obvious scientific ignorance which they
display. F. C. S. SCHILLER.

Fact and Fable in Psychology. BY JOSEPH JASTROW, Professor of Psy
chology in the University of Wisconsin. (Houghton, Mifflin & Co., Boston
and New York, 1900.)
Professor Jastrow's book is a collection of popular essays upon a variety of
psychological topics. Many of them were written a number of years ago,
and are now reprinted from the various magazines in which they first saw
the light.i Most of the essays, we are told, have been submitted to a critical
revision, and brought as far as possible up to date. Two essays to which we
will mainly devote our remarks,—"The Problems of Psychical Research"
and " The Logic of Mental Telegraphy,"—bear only a general resemblance to
their former appearance. In others we are glad to see that some errors of
detail have been corrected. Thus, in the entertaining essay on the Psychology
of Spiritualism, in which Prof. Jastrow, borrowing largely from the results
of the Seybert Commission and of the S.P.R. investigations, acutely diagnoses
Spiritualism as a social disease, there occurs the tale of the exposed medium
who confessed that " the first seance I held after it became known to the
Rochester people that I was a medium, a gentleman from Chicago recognised
his daughter Lizzie in me, after I had covered my small moustache with a
piece of flesh-coloured cloth and reduced the size of my face with a shawl I
had purposely hung in the back of the cabinet." The story is so good that
it is sure to earn a mythical immortality. Prof. Jastrow does hot give any
references, and refrains from telling ua whence he got the story and who
was the medium. As a matter of fact the tale is told by D. D. Home in
Lights and Shadows of Spiritualism (p. 405). He " copied from an American
newspaper the confession of a detected trickster, who had been caught in
the act of imposture while giving seances at Rochester, N.Y." In accordance
with the rule observed by him throughout Lights and Shadows, Mr. Home
did not print the name of this interesting penitent, which is represented
only by its initial " J ." 2 Curiously enough, Prof. Jastrow, in his Popular
Science Monthly article (April, 1889), quoted the story as the confession of
"an exposed medium, D. D. Home," who was thus, for the first time, con
victed of imposture and trickery in Prof. Jastrow's essay. We are glad to
see that this singular error has not been repeated in the reprint before us.
But he is as careful not to give any authority for the major part of his facts
in the reprint of his essay as he was in the original article. That any one
should let slip such a mistake who had, however cursorily, glanced through
Lights and Shadows of Spiritualism, is not easy to believe. To the student
i We transcribe from the preface their chronological order : The Dreams of the
Blind (Jan., 1888), The Psychology of Deception (Dec., 1888), The Psychology of
Spiritualism (April, 1889), The Problems of Psychical Research (June, 1889), The
Natural History of Analogy (1891), A Study of Involuntary Movements (April
and Sept., 1892), The Logic of Mental Telegraphy (October, 1895), Hypnotism
and its Antecedents (February, 1896), Mental Prepossession and Inertia (April,
1897), The Mind's Eye (1899), The Modern Occult (1900).

xi.iv.] Review. 253
of the Proceedings of the S.P.R., on the other hand, much of Mr. Jastrow's
material has a familiar look. Why does he not take the trouble to acknow
ledge his indebtedness to the obvious sources ? He admits, with a generosity
which all his colleagues do not share, that the publications of the S.P.R.
are not wholly devoid of value. Why does he not reveal the extent of the
benefit he has derived from them 1 This plain duty was all the more in
cumbent upon him that he chooses what he finds convenient and leaves the
rest. The result is wholly misleading. Such an attitude cannot be too
severely condemned. Methods which custom allows an advocate to use
would be morally reprehensible in a judge, aud canons of evidence pass
muster in a party pamphlet which have no place in a scientific memoir.
In what light then are we to view this book ? " The present collection
of essays is offered as a contribution towards the realisation of a sounder
interest in, and a more important appreciation of, certain problems upon
which psychology has an authoritative charge to make to the public jury.
These essays take their stand distinctively upon one side of certain issues,
and, as determinately as the situation seems to warrant, antagonise contrary
positions ; they aim to oppose certain tendencies and to support others ; to
show that the sound and profitable interest in mental life is in the usual
and the normal. . . ." In other words, Prof. Jastrow claims the right and
assumes the responsibility of making a number of ex cathedra statements
upon a variety of subjects, some of which he conceives have dangerously
engrossed the public interest to the detriment of others. He wishes to
educate the interest of the public in psychological matters. He conceives
that a science cannot prosper if the public take no interest in it, cannot
thrive if it be misunderstood by the layman. It is difficult to see what the
layman's opinion can possibly matter on a question of pure science, or why
the layman should be allowed any voice whatever. To the public, science
is revealed religion, and the savant its prophet. The layman believes on
authority, that is his privilege. But in what sense can he be supposed to
form part of a jury ? On account of the public interest taken in the obscure
and the unusual, said Prof. Jastrow in a presidential address to the American
Psychological Association, the current conception of psychology is becoming
distorted, and the true interests of psychology are jeopardised by the un
fortunate confusion of psychology with what is termed psychical research.
Not only then is the public to decide which of two trends of scientific
•opinion is the more likely to be fruitful of results, but science is conceived
by Prof. Jastrow to freeze and shrivel up if the indiscreet curiosity of the
uninformed public happens to follow the wrong track. And it is in order
to avert this unfortunate catastrophe that Prof. Jastrow delivers his charge
to the public jury. It is, he conceives, "particularly the obligation of the
torch-bearers of science to illuminate the path of progress, and to transmit
the light to their successors with uudiminished power and brilliancy ; the
flame must burn both as a beacon-light to guide the wayfarer along the
pathways of science, and as a warning against the will-o'-the-wisps that
shine seductively in the by-ways."
254- F. N. Hales. [PAKT
These essays, then, would appear to subserve a double purpose. In the
first place, they aim at uprooting certain pernicious beliefs widely dissemi
nated among the magazine public. In the second place, we have a right to
infer, from the sentence just quoted, that they are addressed to scientific
men as well. But the two purposes are really one to Professor Jastrow'a
mind. The pure light of " the torch of science " runs a risk of flickering-
out, so long as the public gaze is fascinated by some more attractive " will-
o'-the-wisp." Hence, to dispel popular superstitious is ipso facto to render
a service to science. This attitude of the author explains the character of
the book. In it Prof. Jastrow, representing a certain school of psychology,
appears both as advocate and as judge, vindicating his own cause before a
jury which is equally unable to grasp the principles underlying either of
the opposing "Tendenzen." As an advocate, he permits himself the use of
rhetorical devices, and as an authoritative psychologist speaking to a popular
audience, he assumes the right of laying down general principles without
pausing to justify them ; this unfortunate ambiguity runs through the whole
book, and makes the task of the critic a thankless one. In most of the-
essays, however, it cannot lead to serious misunderstanding. Those on the
Modern Occult, on the Psychology of Spiritualism, on the Natural History of
Analogy, on Hypnotism, on the Psychology of Deception, etc.—though they
cannot be considered as contributions to science—will certainly answer the
purpose they were intended to fulfil. The essay on Dreams of the Blind,
on the other hand, we are very grateful to see rescued from the comparative
obscurity of the New Princeton Review. Of the " Experimental Investigation
of Automatic Movements" we shall have a word to say later on. But it
was hardly to be expected that any useful purpose could be served by
discussing the logical status of Psychical Research and of "Mental Tele
graphy" in essays of so manifestly didactic, and so unfortunately popular a
character. Had they been mere individual expressions of opinion, there-
would have been all the more justification for not noticing them. But we
have heard them expressed before, we shall probably hear them again, and
it may help to clear away misunderstandings if we examine and answer
Prof. Jastrow's arguments one by one. The existence of the Society for
Psychical Research, and the growth of its problems, give rise to the ques
tion, What attitude is to be taken to the outlying phenomena of mind ?
" Are they," asks Prof. Jastrow, " are they outcasts, to be treated in a spirit
of charity and forbearance? Are they the true owners of the land, the
unjustly deposed and rightful heirs, soon to be restored to their kingdom by
a fairer and more searching examination of their title ?" And by means of a
series of similar metaphors, he conjures up before the startled psychologist
a threatening mass of obscure phenomena struggling to dispossess the
familiar facts of normal, waking life of their claim upon the scientist's
attention.
Surely no way of stating the problem could possibly be more misleading.
It appears to imply that there are on the one hand a certain number of
respectable, conservative owners of the field, and on the other hand au
XLIV.] Review. 255
inimical crowd of revolutionary malcontents ; it implies a party warfare
within the republic of science, in which each party seeks its own good
regardless of the good of the whole. Professor Jastrow appears to believe
that psychology may be defined by means of an absolute disjunction ; that
it is the study of one category of phenomena to the exclusion of another
category of phenomena. We have seen that he speaks of " the unfortunate
confusion of psychology with what is termed psychical research," and that,
according to him, " the spirit and attitude of psychical research towards
psychology has been productive of harm to our profession [that of psycho
logist] and to the reputation which we cherish." Now what are, in his
view, the essential characteristics of psychology, and what are those of
psychical research ? Professor Jastrow has himself put the question, and
he finds that " the precise status of psychical research, and its relations to
other departments of scientific inquiry, are far from obvious." Surely, he
exclaims, the problems of psychical research ought to be able to find a nook
in so commodious a home as Psychology, individual and comparative, normal
and abnormal ! But he soon finds an apparent differentiating characteristic :
" Whereas Psychology studies the recognised and explicable phases of mental
phenomena, Psychical Research is occupied with the disputed and mysterious."
And such a differentiation is as unwarranted as it is clearly absurd. " The
legitimate problems of Psychical Research are equally and necessarily genuine
problems of Psychology, that require no special designation." Prof. Jastrow
complains that psychical research " separates a group of problems from their
natural habitat . . . violently transports a growth from its environment."
And he vehemently protests against the notion " that while the psychologist
may be listened to with respect and authority in one portion of his topic, the
layman and the member of the S.P.R. are equally or more competent to
pronounce judgments in a closely allied field." Surely this is once more
the false disjunction noticed above ! It is certain that any given psychologist,
in so far as he has no knowledge of a special topic, is himself a layman with
regard to that topic, and his opinion carries no sort of authority. But the
assertion that psychology as such has no claim to meddle with psychical
research, meets us for the first time in Prof. Jastrow's pages. Does he mean,
on the other hand, to imply that the psychical researcher is ignorant of
psychology ? He is ready to admit that " a considerable portion of the
influential contributors to Psychical Research are animated by as truly
scientific motives as labourers in any other field of psychological endeavour."
He quotes with approval Mr. Podmore ; he borrows copiously from the
inquiries of Dr. Hodgson, of Mrs. Sidgwick, of S. T. Davey. But there are
some " who subscribe to pernicious and illogical conclusions, and indirectly
eucourage a most unfortunate attitude in others."
Discussing the actual interests which give vitality to Psychical Research, he
ascribes the chief order of importance to the occult interest ; he allows that
there is also a psychological point of view ; he quotes with approval Mr.
Lang's "comparative psychical research." But the characteristic trait of
the psychical researcher, the one which brands him as the pariah of science,
256 F. N. Hales. [PART
in Professor Jastrow's view, is that the psychical researcher always seeks to
prove or to disprove something. "As soon as he succeeds in finding a con
sistent and commonplace explanation for a group of phenomena, his main
curiosity is satisfied, and he takes to pastures new." Very different is the
true psychological interest, we are told, in Madame Blavatsky's performances,
e.g., "The logical scientist was quite convioced that Madame Blavatsky had
not discovered the means of carrying ponderables by unseen agencies iron*
China to Peru" ; just as apparently the logical scientist in Professor Jastrow's-
view does not require to study the Mrs. Piper records, still less experiment
personally with Mrs. Piper, in order to give a theory of the phenomena ; nor
to wait for positive evidence before reaching the conviction that, however
D. D. Home managed to do his tricks, he was at auy rate and most certainly an
impostor. The psychological problem in all these cases is a quite different
one : " It tiikes up the inquiry as to how such marvellous pretensions came
to be believed, by what influences conviction is formed and doctrines
spread." Such is the fundamental difference of principle between psycho-
. logist and psychical researcher, according to our author—that while the
psychologist knows there is "nothing in it," without the tedium of a special
inquiry, the psychical researcher takes the trouble to collect, evidence in
order to have some special proof whether there is " anything in it " or not.
We protest, in the interests of psychology, against this caricature of
psychological ideals, and in fairness to psychical research we protest no less
strongly against the charge of occultism insinuated by Professor Jastrow's
phrase "something in it." It is a mood which he thus characterises, not a
definite logical position ; it is a mood which we detest quite as much as he
does ; it is a mood which every scientist detests, because it denies the ra« ion-
ality of his pursuit. And we gladly abandon to any one's satire the idly
curious layman who, by a kind of Schadenfreude rejoices whenever some
outhouse of science collapses on the heads of the masons within. Such a
mood has nothing, however, to do with logic. The scientific conservatism
upheld by Professor Jastrow is no less a mood, and no less foreign to logic.
Is psychology, then, so perfect a science that we need not trouble to inves
tigate phenomena which at first sight seem difficult to explain by the
theories current in any one year? Is the basis of our science, then, so
secure that it is mere waste of time to study facts which at first sight do not
harmonise as perfectly as we might wish with facts already investigated ?
Does not the very essence of research consist in finding out whether there
be or be not "something in" a certain fact at present obscure ; in finding
out whether this fact makes for one theory or for another ? We perfectly
agree that some theories may be considered extra-scientific, and that the
scientist could -not without a logical crime consent to refute or even notice
them. It is equally true that the question whether a theory be scientifically
legitimate or not is one which requires careful discussion. But we never
before supposed that it was possible to assert that : " There is no obligation
resting upon the psychologist to make large sacrifices for the pursuit of
ill-defined residual phenomena," When Professor Jastrow speaks of the
XLIV.] . Review. 257
"psychologist," we trust he means the "representative of psychological
science" ; for while it is certain that no one would reproach any given man
with not attempting a task beyond his strength, or which he is by training
or by nature unfit to cope with, this is a purely personal matter, which does
not touch the logical question.
Moreover, so far as a science is unsatisfactory and incomplete, in so
far must the interest of the investigator be directed towards the future
rather than towards the past. A desire for novelty as such has nothing
more logical in it than a wish to keep up with the changing fashions
of dress. But we had always thought it was the main characteristic of
a logical system, such as that of science, that so long as it was incom
plete, no part of it could possibly be regarded as having reached a state
of logical equilibrium. It follows that the interest in that which is
already known, in so far as it is imperfectly known, is a relative interest : it
is relative to the new discoveries which will further define the significance of
the familiar. And the new discoveries have also a merely relative interest: it
is relative to the already known phenomena which they further explain.
We are ashamed to write out these logical platitudes at length. We merely
regret that Professor Jastrow's strictures should have made them necessary.
He censures the S.P.R. for that attitude which is and must be precisely the
attitude of a young science. It is quite as true of the other branches of
experimental psychology as of psychical research that they are constantly
seeking new fields ; just in the same way that they do not and cannot study
anything else than residual phenomena. But the sting of our author's
censure lies perhaps in its tail. He may attach some quite special meaning
to the term " residual phenomena." He censures the S.P.E. indeed again
and again on account of a supposed predilection for the mysterious. Perhaps
he means to hint, by the use of the adjective " residual," that the obscure
phenomena which there is no obligation resting upon the psychologist to
study are also mysterious. We should like a definition of this word ; it is
most unfortunate that the writers who use it most should take least pains
to define it. /'Any fact or thing is mysterious, for instance, in so far as
its properties or nature are insufficiently known ; and whether a man be
merely puzzled by appearances unfamiliar, or whether he be thrilled by a
mystic emotion at their sight, the difference is entirely subjective. The
sort of feelings aroused in a man by the solution of a logical problem does not
alter in any degree the character of that problem.' The word mystery, like
the word supernatural, has no place in the dictionary of science. Either
will be looked for in vain in the writings of our responsible leaders.' Sub
jectively, there are those whom mystery attracts, and those whom it repels.
Both categories of people are, in the end, animated by the same kind of
superstition. Neither has a right to censure the other, because both stand
equally outside the pale of logic. Professor Jastrow, like Professor
Miinsterberg, is one of those for whom the word mystery has a meaning -,
and both alike have a personal distaste for it. But what can that possibly
matter to any one ? '/Were a chemist to excuse himself from investigating
258 F. N. Hales. [PART
certain organic substances because he could not stand the smell, we should
doubtless agree that it was not worth while his injuring his health. But
what would be thought of him if he loudly proclaimed that the department
he was unfit to investigate was not fit to be investigated at all? Candour
requires him to recognise his own personal disability, but not even the most
severe moralist could expect him to publish it abroad in a series of- popular
addresses !
It is then clear that to censure the S.P.R. for investigating "residual
phenomena" is to make a meaningless criticism. Science cannot do anything
else. To censure our leaders for their predominant interest in new fields of
research is equally illogical. In no science, in so far as it is incomplete, can
any body of facts have any other than a relative value. Least of all in the
most backward of all sciences, psychology, is there any justification for a
self-complacent looking backward upon regions already travelled over.
Finally, the reproach that the objects of the S.P.R.'s studies are mysterious
falls back upon those who utter it, and convicts them of that very disposition
which they pretended to diagnose in our leaders.
It is easier still to explain away Prof. Jastrow's other difficulty. Why did
the S.P.R. come into existence at all, and what relation do its problems bear
to other psychological problems 1 He himself has supplied us with the
logical answer ; and he affects to ignore the historical reason, which was far
more potent twenty years ago than it is now. Recognising at one point that
some of the work of the S.P.R. has a certain value, he says that those
problems of psychical research which are legitimate are problems of
psychology. With this we heartily agree. But when he proceeds to imply
that these problems ought never to have been separated from " their natural
habitat," we can no longer follow his argument. Surely it is obvious that
one and the same science can and must be—provisionally at any rate—
separated wp into a number of special departments which may be investi
gated each for its own sake. We might as well wonder that psychologists
leave the study of, e.g., cases of aphasia or of psychical blindness to the care
of medical specialists, on the ground that these pathological problems are
problems of psychology. As Prof. Jastrow himself .-ays : "The division of
the Sciences reflects the diversity of human interests. ... It is obvious
that the Sciences were shaped by human needs." It is obvious that the
division of labour in science has a practical as well as a logical ground. No
man can be equally competent in all branches of his favourite science : that
is the practical cause of the division. He must seek to master a group of
affiliated problems : that is the guiding principle of the division. No one
who is familiar with the sort of work implied will doubt the practical
justification of the growth of " psychical research." No one can possibly
feign to ignore the historical reason of this growth. Had the Society for
Psychical Research never been founded, no psychologist would ever have
troubled to consider even the very most elementary of its problems.
Prof. Jastrow appears to question the logical justification of the S.P.R. pro
gramme, on the ground that its investigations are sometimes of a physical
XLIV.] Review. 259
sometimes of a physiological character. We might answer him by pointing to a
number of mixed sciences—to chemical physiology, or to physical chemistry ;
which are but so many illustrations of the continuity of the sciences. But we
prefer to critically examine the view of the functions and limits of psychology
as it is implied (unfortunately not expressed) in some specially curious
passages. The phenomena claimed to occur in the presence of spiritualistic
mediums are by no means new. Their analogues exist in the folk-lore of
almost every land, from China to Peru, and from the North Pole to the
South. Anthropology has always considered it as its function to trace back
a myth to its sources, to map out ihe course of the spreading belief. But it
has never been able to go back to the font et origo. Whether any pheno
menon occurred which could reasonably have given rise to the myth ; what
relation there was between the fact and the belief about the fact —these are
questions which the historical method could not possibly solve. It could
only trace the transformations of belief, and the first term of its historical
deduction could but be the subjective belief, not the objective fact. The only
method by which this could be studied was the experimental method. We
had always conceived it to be the great merit of the S.P.R. that it uncom
promisingly adhered to the rules of scientific logic, and inaugurated the
experimental investigation of the modern analogues of the old phenomena.
If, then, it be allowed that the investigation of the growth of a myth or
belief is not complete until all its conditions, objective and subjective, have
been discovered, it is no objection to say that the investigation of spiritualism,
for instance, is largely tin- business of physics, or of some science other than
psychology or anthropology. The objection would only be cogent if it could
be shown that the investigation was complete at any given point. In so far
as anthropology erected hypotheses as to the relation between a given belief
and the fact believed in, it cannot censure psychical research for having
sought experimental verification of such hypotheses.
The same argument holds of psychology with regard, e.g., to the pro
blem of telepathy, in so far as psychology abandons the stand-point
of absolute subjectivism. It is no doubt an instructive task to expound
what used to be called the " laws of mind," to trace the processes by
which the various material of presentation gets woven into a complex
whole. Some of Professor Jastrow's expressions seem to imply that
the psychologist's interest begins and ends with the discovery of
neat illustrations of the working of various mental tendencies. Thus he
fiuds "interesting psychological points in such diverse occupations as the
actor's profession, in juggling, in tricks of skill, in advertising, in religious
revivals, etc." He speaks of the evidence in proof of telepathy as being
"capable of psychological interpretation," and containing "illustrations of
obscure and subtle mental processes." Does he mean that any endeavour to
pass from the subjective to the objective is extra-psychological ; that, for
instance, a psychological theory of colour-vision has no right to take into
account either physical conceptions of wave-motion or physio-chemical con
ceptions of nerve-processes ; that the sphere of psychical objects—to use
260 F. N. Hales. [PART
Munsterberg's terminology—can and must be completely separated from the
sphere of physical objects ; that psychology, as a science of psychical elements
and their laws of combination, has no right to, and no interest in, relating
these psychical elements to anything outside them ? Psychology, on such a
conception, becomes individual and subjective with a vengeance. The con
ception is worth elaborating, and we readily confess that psychical research
is not compatible with it. We could not but allow that, although psychical
research offered the psychologist much interesting illustrative material, yet
its main interest was extra-psychological. In the same way, did anthro
pology choose to adopt a standpoint of radical subjectivism, and to maintain
it consistently, our arguments would have no force.
But Professor Jastrow shows no symptoms of such a consistency.
The principle implied on the one page is denied on the next ; and
we find after all that the only reason for Professor Jastrow's state
ments is that "logical" science is perfectly cognisant of the objective
significance of this or that order of phenomena (spiritualistic, tele
pathic, etc.), i.e. that the only feature of interest about them is just the
subjective feature. This naturally is a matter of proof. The difference
between the " psychical researcher " and the psychologist of Prof. Jastrow's
type is just that the one seeks experimental evidence where the other is
content with an analogical argument. The difference of attitude is total,
but there is no essential difference between the two conceptions of psychology.
It is only from the standpoint of radical subjectivism that any exception can
be taken to psychical research on the ground that it calls in the aid of
physics or physiology, or any other science. And if that point of view be
abandoned, psychology must go the whole length of psychi<al research. Just
as, on the ordinary view, any other but a psycho-physical theory of, say,
colour-vision must be quite devoid of significance, FO with regard to halluci
nations, including the so-called telepathic hallucinations, we cau rest satisfied
with none but a psycho-physical theory. The ordinary rules of inductive
logic will apply here as elsewhere ; and the question whether two phenomena
A and B, which are contiguous in time, are or are not connected as cause and
effect, admits essentially of the same kind of solution, be the phenomena
what they may. We cannot allow that Prof. Jastrow has shown the guiding
principles of the founders of the S.P.R. to be in any way illogical. The
existence of the Society can readily be justified on scientific, practical, and
historical grounds. So long as its work has not been taken up by official
laboratories, these grounds will retain their old cogency. It is no less easy
to show that the problems with which it has dealt, and the methods with
which it has treated them, are an inevitable development of old problems
unsatisfactorily solved, and of antiquated methods logically incomplete.
Between psychical research and psychology there can be no possible opposi
tion ; and the only real danger which the tatter has to fear from the former
is that the psychologist should misunderstand the aims and methods of the
psychical researcher.
We need not examine Professor Jastrow's essay on " The Logic of Mental
XLIV.] . Review. 261
Telegraphy " in detail. What is new in his criticisms we have already
answered by implication. In the main he has repeated the arguments
brought forward by Herr Parish some years ago, and so completely refuted
by Mrs. Sidgwick. When Prof. Jastrow remarks that "it is only necessary
to be interested in coincidences in order to discover them on all fides," we-
cannot find that he contributes anything to the debate. On the one hand, a
leading interest is necessary to the discovery of coincidences, whatever they
maybe,—whether the botanist endeavours to find out the analogies of structure-
common to various plants, or the zoologist to classify an organism hitherto
unknown to him. And it is equally clear that such an interest tnsy to some
extent create these very coincidences. Secondary resemblances may be
magnified, primary differences overlooked, mid so forth. The danger in this
respect is common to all scientific research alike. But if Prof. Jastrow
means that a person interested in so-called telepathic hallucinations will
most likely notice a coincidence between a hallucination and some other
event, this is a question which can only be solved one way or the other by
positive evidence. It has been examined at length in the "Report on the
Census of Hallucinations," and we see no reason to reject the solution
therein reached.
Another kind of argument equally devoid of cogency is the following : all
sorts of coincidences have a law-abiding character. There is a statistical
regularity about the yearly number of births and deaths and marriages, or of
unaddressed letters thrown into the post. "The experience of offering an
article to an editor and receiving a reply to the effect that another article
dealing with the same topic in a similar way was already awaiting the com
positor is not unusual." It would be interesting, indeed, to know whether
the number of death-coincidences had this kind of statistical regularity, or
whether the number of right cases in experiments on thought-transference
performed under identical conditions presented a law-abiding character.
But this does not in the least alter the logical status of the question. If the
number of right cases or the number of coincidental hallucinations were
greater than the theory of probability allowed for, we should nevertheless be
obliged to draw the conclusion that some cause other than chance was in
operation.
When Prof. Jastrow goes on to consider whether the hypothesis of tele
pathy is scientifically legitimate or not, he forgets that the hypothesis has for
the present the smallest possible positive content, that it makes no kind of
assumption with regard to the manner of connection of the phenomena,—the
coincidence which it affirms to be not due to chance alone. It affirms that
a state of consciousness (a) of a subject A is connected with a state (l>) of a
subject B ; but whether this connection be direct or indirect, or what is the
precise relation between the two phenomena, these are questions which it
cannot attempt seriously to answer. It asserts a causal relation, but dues
not explain the causal process. The "telepathy-hypothesis" should be cnn-
sidered, therefore, as nothing more and nothing less than the statement of a
problem. That there is a problem we hold to have been sufficiently proved.
262 F. N. Hales. [PART
To ask whether the data of the problem are scientifically legitimate or not
is simply devoid of meaning. The data simply are, and science has to
consider them.
But we readily agree with Prof. Jastrow that the attitude " which insists
upon a detailed and exact explanation of concrete personal experiences " is a
deplorable and illogical attitude at the stage which the inquiry has reached ;
and the tendency to believe in the personal significance of events is no less to
be regretted. If psychical research has been misunderstood by its advei-
saries, its friends must bear the greater part of the blame. It is only too
probable that much of its popularity has been due to a love of the mysterious
and to an interest in the peculiar on the part of the general public. It
behoves the S.P.R. to make clear to its supporters what its leading principles
really are, and to seriously consider Prof. Jastrow's words of warning :
'Unless most wisely directed, Psychical Research is likely, by not letting
the right hand know what the left hand is doing, to foster the undesirable
propensities of human nature as rapidly as it antagonises them. Like
indiscriminate almsgiving, it has possibilities of affording relief, and of
making paupers at the same time."
Lack of space forbids more than a very cursory notice of the most important
contribution to psychology contained in the volume,—" The Dreams of the
Blind." The general fact that "the mode of functioning of a brain-centre
depends largely upon its initial education, but that, this education once
completed, the centre can maintain its function, though deprived of sense-
stimulation " was well worth illustrating by the comparative method. There
appears to be a critical period, which both Heermann (1838) and Jastrow
place between the fifth and seventh years. Persons who go blind before the
fifth year have, as a rule, no visual dreams. Persons who go blind after
their seventh year have usually visual dreams. If blindness occurs between
the fifth and seventh years, the preservation of the visualising power depends
upon the degree of development of the individual. ''We could have wished
that the author had studied the precise relation between the imagery in
waking life and in the dreams of the blind, and had mentioned those cases of
so-called psychical blindness in which the patient still has visual dreams,
although he has lost the power of visual recognition and visual reproduction
in waking life.
The experimental study of involuntary movements has the great merit of
being the first in time of a series of similar researches by other psychologists
in America and elsewhere. A subject's hand, resting free upon a mobile
recording plate, has, according to Prof. Jastrow, a tendency to move towards
the object to which the subject is attending. The experiments are worth
repeating with less primitive apparatus. Prof. Jastrow himself has noticed
the tendency of the arm to move towards the body, yet he neglects to inform
us in many cases whether the right hand or the left was resting on the
recording-plate. We are not told how many different subjects he experi
mented with, nor under what conditions ; whether they knew the purpose of
the experiment, or were ignorant of it ; what kind of a tracing was obtained
XLIV.] Review. 263
in each case when the subject's attention was not directed to anything in
particular. This latter point is specially important, as no two subjects under
these conditions appear to yield identical, or indeed closely similar tracinga.
The technical deficiencies of the apparatus and the small number of the pub
lished tracings prevent ua from placing any confidence in the results.

La SuggettibilM, par DR. ALFRED BINET (Paris, Schleicher freres, 1900.
pp. 400).
Psycho-physiology progresses in the same way as physics and the other
branches of natural science, though perhaps more slowly. Each contribution,
however small, adds to the exactness of analysis, and to the solidity of the
whole scientific structure. But there is another form of psychology, let us
call it introspective or " individual " psychology, which does not advance in
the same way. For instance, since the introduction of hypnotism and
suggestion as subjects of scientific investigation, hundreds of books and
pamphlets have appeared on these questions, of which only very few, perhaps-
ten or twenty, were really steps in advance. Most of them may be safely
left unread by the student, unless they contain material for discussion,—well
observed and reliable facts.
Dr. Biiiet's last book on suggestibility may be considered a step in advance.
It is the first successful attempt to bring clearness into this loosely used and
vaguely defined term. It describes methods of investigation, and defines the
distinctions between suggestion and other conceptions, such as " hypnotism."
The two terms, hypnotism and suggestion, are usually mixed up in a
hopeless way, and not only by laymen. In Dr. Binet's book hypnotism is
absolutely excluded from the field of observation. We have to do with,
suggestion and suggestibility pure and simple.
Suggestibility is treated here as a normal quality of the healthy humaii-
individual,—a quality which is never altogether lacking, but which varies in
intensity between rather wide limits, while its excess merges into the
pathological. According to Dr. Binet, it is possible to measure the degree of
this quality, and to give in figures the co-efficient of suggestibility for each'
individual. The methods and experiments by which he attempts to show
this are admirably ingenious, but his desire for exactness often leads him to-
numerical results of very doubtful value, because of the small number of
experiments. What can be deduced from statistics in individual psychology-
derived from experiments with 46 persons ?
But nevertheless, what is most valuable, the methods are indicated and a
beginning is made. Dr. Binet will agree with us in expecting different
results when not scores but thousands of individuals have been tested.
The book is extremely important on account of the wide scope of this same-
quality, " suggestibility," the study of which is necessary not only for the
psychologist and the philosopher, but for the medical student, the student of
law, and especially for the teacher.
•264 Dr. F. van Eeden. [PART
Dr. Biuet has studied methodically and defined scientifically facts and ideas
•which were not altogether unknown, which have even become rooted in the
popular belief in the form of anecdotes and proverbs. But the teacher who
by dint of his carefully guarded authority stamps on his young pupil any
artificial belief or unnatural creed never to be eradicated, or the judge eiitrap-
ping an innocent but suggestible person to his doom by subtle and persuasive
questioning, are instances of the terrible meaning of the vaguely noted facts.
Indeed, this book, if carefully read, will open more eyes to the extreme
•danger of authoritative teaching and bias on the part of the judicial enquirer
than all the warnings of moralists. Any one of common sense will see after
perusal of these simple experiments that it is absolutely necessary to change
•our general principles of education, to do away as much as possible with the
influence of personal authority or prestige on the side of the teacher, and to
teach our children independence of judgment, and the power of using their
own eyes instead of those of the master. When we apply the lessons of this
'book to the great social, political, and religious movements of the masses—
subjects wisely not touched upon by the author—their significance becomes
•enormous, and the necessity of a widespread study of them most evident.
The terms "automatism" and "suggestibility" are not so clearly dis
tinguished as hypnotism aud suggestion. Indeed, the experiments and
speculations about " automatism " are the weakest parts of the book.
In Dr. P. Janet's well-known book, IIAutomatisms Psychologique, very
.different phenomena were gathered together under the name of automatism.
In this book it was the facts rather than their classification which were dwelt
•upon, and it seems to me that Dr. Binet's treatment increases the difficulty
.instead of solving it.
We apply the word "automaton" to a thing which can move by itself, with-
•out any impulse from without. The materialistic school of the last century
considered the whole human organism an automaton, denying that it was
mioved by that force of superhuman origin which we call will, or soul. The
present use of the word " automatism " for a part only of the organism seems
to involve a tacit assumption that the whole is not purely automatic. And
at is clear that unless the mystical or superhuman agent can act always and
.everywhere, automatism must play a part in the organism.
But the experiments of Dr. Binet taken alone might lead many readers
•to the conclusion—apparently shared by the author—that it is now proved
that in the so-called automatic writing of mediums, no superhuman or extra-
human agency is ever present. This conclusion, however, is by no means
justified by the facts. In his experiments, Dr. Binet simply takes a few-
fragments of the complicated human organism, and makes them act spon
taneously in an automatic way by patient and ingenious devices. Such
procedure is no proof at all that the same disintegration cannot be performed
by some other external influence, human or non-human. This fallacious
.conclusion is not indeed explicitly drawn, but it seems to be implied.

Hypnotism and Suggestion in Therapeutics, Education, and Reform, by
R. OSGOOD MASON, A.M., M.D. (Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner and Co.
London, 1901.)
Under the above title Dr. Osgood Mason has brought together in a small
book of some 340 large type pages, a mass of speculation, observation, and
criticism (together, I may add, with not a little rhetoric), touching almost
all the phenomena, or alleged phenomena, which are usually considered
subjects of psychical research, as well as a good deal else besides. Hypnotism
and the ethics of it, the subconscious mind, life and the underlying reality,
clairvoyance, telepathy, Reichenbach, oriental occultism, all pass under
review. The result is a readable, discursive, and very miscellaneous book,
of, it must be confessed, somewhat unequal value, but of very consider
able interest where the author's own personal observation and practical
experience are concerned. It would seem that in the transparent atmosphere
of the continent across the Atlantic, just as distant physical objects are made
to look closer than they really are, so there is a tendency to regard as very
near at hand the solution of problems which to European enquirers still
appear but dimly apprehended. And I venture to think that in his anxiety
to construct a theory which will harmonize and co-ordinate all the various
subjects with which he deals, Dr. Mason has shown himself somewhat
influenced by this tendency and has perhxps allowed himself to assume a
greater degree of familiarity with their nature than is altogether warranted
by the general state of knowledge concerning them. The hypnotic state
which, in at least one European school, and probably by the public at large
almost universally, has been considered to be a more or less pathological and
exceptional condition, is here, implicitly at least, treated as the manifestation
•of a universal psychic force, its scope only limited by our experience, and
its invocation for a given purpose, ethically considered, as indifferent as that
of electricity or any other similar force in nature.
Many instances of its successful therapeutic application are given, and one
cannot help thinking that Dr. Mason has perhaps been exceptionally fortu
nate in his subjects, or, as one would prefer to believe, exceptionally skilful
in his treatment of them. For although, in other annals, examples of the
reformation of inebriates and of the morally perverted are often quoted,
which are as remarkable as certain cases in Dr. Mason's own experience,
the general results of hypnotic treatment of such patients do not on the
whole seem to fulfil the expectations of some of the more enthusiastic
experimenters of a few years back ; and though it is true, as Dr. Mason says,
that undue conservatism has altogether prevented its adoption in some
quarters, it is none the less true that a more extended experience in other
quarters of the uncertainty of its results has led to a considerable
limitation of its employment. Dr. Mason indeed calls attention to the fact
that the general feeling of the medical profession is that the therapeutic
usefulness of hypnotism is very limited. It may be presumed that if this
feeling still persists after all these years of systematic investigation of the
266 E. Feilding. [PART
capabilities of suggestive treatment, it cannot be entirely traceable to
prejudice or ignorance. While in words Dr. Mason disavows any wish to
claim for it either miraculous results or general applicability to the majority
of persons, the impression left on the mind of a reader of his book is that in
fact he is far more optimistic regarding its ultimate universal value than
certain of his phrases would suggest. A chapter is devoted to the educa
tional use of hypnotism and some remarkable instances of successful
treatment of cases difficult to deal with by other methods are given. I may
select the following for citation: "A generally intelligent, but uneducated
woman, 35 years of age, although a good reader, experienced the greatest
difficulty in spelling ; she never wrote a letter without being obliged to
consult a dictionary for the majority of words. . . . She was an excellent
hypnotic subject. . . . One day, now a year ago, she asked me if I could not
do something by suggestion for her troublesome inability to spell. I replied
that I would make the trial if she desired. Accordingly, I suggested a»
follows : ' You can read ; the correct form of every word you wish to write
is already in your mind ; now when you are in doubt you will not try to
tiiia1.- how the word is spelled ; you will become passive and at once an
impression of the correct spelling of the word will come to you, and you will
write it without doubting or looking in the dictionary to see if it is right/
The effect was immediate, and after two or three treatments, in order to
show the improvement, and express her gratitude, she wrote me a four page
letter, without consulting the dictionary, and in which were only two or
three errors in spelling. Her language was most markedly that of an
uneducated person. She constantly omitted her final g's—said ' says I,' and
was entirely regardless of singular and plural in the use of nominatives and
verbs. Half a dozen suggestions removed these errors in an astonishing-
manner, so that her language is now that of a fairly educated woman—not
faultless, but good."
The following is one of Dr. Mason's most interesting examples of his suc
cess in the reformation of character. " A little boy, seven years of age, was &
most unhappy coward—afraid of the slightest pain, and a coward and cry-baby
among his playmates. He had some slight disease of the scalp which it was
necessary to treat, but he would cry and run away the moment I entered the
room. After one or two unhappy and only partially successful attempts at
treatment, I decided to try suggestion. Placing him in a chair opposite me,
I took his face and head firmly between my hands, and putting my face near
his, I commanded him to look steadily in my eyes. It was very difficult to
secure his attention, but having succeeded, I soothed him with passes and
light touches, until his eyelids drooped ; he was perfectly quiet, subjective
and sleepy, but not asleep. I then suggested that he would no longer be a
crying, whimpering coward, but a strong, brave boy ; that he would take his
treatment without fear, and that he would stand up sturdily for his rights
among his fellows. This was repeated over and over, gently, but firmly ; he
all the while remaining passive and sleepy, and apparently taking no notice
whatever of my suggestions. The next time I called he was shy, but not
XLIV.] Review. 267
troublesome, and with two or three repetitions of the suggestions he came
promptly and bravely to his treatment.
" I was also informed that the change in his manner among his playmates
was equally marked ; certainly all cringing and cowardly manner had dis
appeared, and he seemed self-reliant and happy."
These are interesting examples of an application of hypnotism in which
Dr. Mason expects to see great developments in the next half-century,
whereby it will be placed " among the most highly prized agents for good in
use among intelligent well-wishers of humanity."
To the objection so often urged against the justifiability of hypnotic treat
ment on the ground of its being an interference with free will, Dr. Mason
devotes a good deal of space. He quotes a father who said he would rather
his sou should go wrong of his own free will, than right by having that free
will interfered with by hypnotism. Yet what, he asks in effect, is education
itself but the interference with the free will of the child by the presentation
of motives for action in the right direction so continued as to be, in the long
run, irresistible ? Your son offends, and you seek to lead him from his
offending by exhortation, by instruction, by the constant presentation of
higher ideals, by punishments. If you succeed, you will have influenced his
will. If you fail, what is the conclusion ? Either that the motives for a
change of conduct have been of insufficient strength, or that the boy's mind
has not been sufficiently impressionable, by reason of other distracting causes,
to appreciate them. If through hypnotism you are able to eliminate this
distraction, to increase the impressionability of his mind, to present the
motives for improvement in such a form that they will be acted upon, where
is the harm ? In what way is his individuality more tampered with than by
the other and unsuccessful method of dealing with him ?
If the question went no further than this, I take it that there could be but
one reasonable answer, and that favourable to Dr. Mason's contention. But
the problem is somewhat wider. We must ask ourselves how far, quiie
apart from the particular victory over the particular fault, we have upset the
normal balance between the conscious and the sub-conscious planes ; how far
the temporary emergence of the latter into consciousness may not result in
a tendency to intrude there increasingly in the future ; and to what extent
the habit of reliance on external suggestions may result in a restriction of
spontaneous effort. We still know little of the true nature of hypnotism ;
little of what actually takes place when we probe into the hidden depths
beneath consciousness, and of the possible lesions, unperceived and perhaps
unperceivable, that may result from our intrusion among the secret fibres
of being. The bulk of trustworthy evidence does indeed, so far as I am
justified in attempting to weigh it, appear to show that in the hands of a
cautious operator the use of hypnotic suggestion is unattended by any
general harmful results. But the habitual therapeutic use of hypnotism is
still confined to a comparatively small number of specialists, and it seems
still somewhat premature to lay down its complete and invariable inno-
cuity almost as an axiom, as Dr. Mason appears to do, and to inculcate such

Madame Piper et la Socie'tJ Anglo-Amefacaine pour let Secfiercfus Psyc/iiques,
by M. SAGE, with a Preface by CAMILLE FLAMMARION (Paris, 1902).
The name of Mrs. Piper is well known to all who have any interest iu the
observation of trance-mediums, but definite and accurate knowledge of the
phenomena of her trance is not easily accessible to those outside the small
circle of genuine students who are prepared to read the volumes of detailed
reports and criticism that have appeared in the Proceedings of the Society for
Psychical Research. This little book, consisting of some twenty chapters,
has been produced by Monsieur Sage in the interests of French readers ; but
it is to be recommended to all who wish for a clear and accurate general
statement of the case of Mrs. Piper, as an introduction to the detailed study
of the first-hand reports essential to the serious student of such phenomena.
Monsieur Sage gives an account of the origin of the trance, and of the
various phases of its development during the fifteen years that Mrs. Piper
has been under the close observation of the Society for Psychical Research,
and, in particular, of the Secretary of the American Branch, Dr. Richard
Hodgson. He treats in a thoroughly impartial spirit the many and compli
cated questions suggested by an examination of the evidence ; he allows no
personal bias to interfere with his statement of the various hypotheses that
have been put forward in explanation of the facts, nor to determine his
selection of the incidents to be narrated. His condensed accounts of the
general character of the sittings described at length in the Society's Pro
ceedings are vivid and correct, and the reviewer has detected no inaccuracies
of statement where cases are quoted in illustration of particular points. It
is true that in some instances the racy vernacular of "Dr. Phinuit" has not
been wholly intelligible to the foreigner ; to " swop hats," for instance, is
represented by " Jeter a terre les chapeaux des passants " ; but careful com
parison with the first-hand reports—a task much facilitated by Monsieur
Sage's chronological treatment of his subject and his constant references to
the original publications—has not revealed more than two or three such slips,
and in no case has the error had any effect upon the evidential value of the
incident related.
The author expressly disclaims originality ; he has himself no first-hand
knowledge of the phenomena described ; his aim is to embody in a popular
and readable form the results of long and careful investigations by others.
This he has successfully accomplished ; the reader closes his little volume
with a considerable knowledge of the facts observed, and a clear idea of the
various theories that have been held or discussed by the actual observers.
It contains a very good summary of the results of the laborious investigations
of Professor Hyslop,—the latest contribution to our knowledge of the Piper
phenomena,—and has been brought up to date by the inclusion of the
sensational article in the New York Herald of October last, and Mrs. Piper's

denial of the statements and intentions therein attributed to her. The book
is brightly and pleasantly written, and one is tempted to regret, in the
interest of the reader unacquainted with French, that there is no similar
work in English. M. BE G. VERRALL.
Magic and Religion, by ANDREW LANG. (Longmans, Green and Co. 8vo.
pp. 316. London, 1901.)
This volume is, for the most part, a continuous criticism of Mr. Frazer's
Golden Bough. Mr. Lang and Mr. Frazer disagree almost in toto as to
the facts which are held to explain the origin of religions. The former
tends in the direction of a "primitive illumination " which has been gradu
ally lowered in tone side by side with the progress of mankind in other
respects, the steady decline of religion keeping pace, oddly enough, with
the steady improvement of social feelings and current morality. Mr.
Frazer on the other hand seeks for the fans et origo of the most exalted
creeds in the rites and practices of primitive magic, and, as is well known,
does not hesitate in the added chapters of his recent edition to offer on
these lines an explanation of the great tragedy of Calvary itself.
With the main contents of Magic and Religion the psychical researcher
has little to do, despite the deep interest possessed by Mr. Lang's delightful
pages for the student of anthropology and folklore. Even the final chapter
—dealing with the "Fire Walk"—which possesses a more direct interest
for the psychical investigator, has to a large extent already appeared in
the Proceedings of the S.P.R. But a quantity of fresh evidence has been
added by Mr. Lang, and in view of this he has withdrawn the " psychical "
explanation which he formerly offered in " Modern Mythology," and now
leaves the question open with the implied conviction that it is one for
the physician and physiologist alone. Nevertheless it is not easy to see
why this change of front should be derived from the cases, cited by
Mr. Lang, where Europeans have taken part in the fire-walk, and from
Dr. Hocken's examination of the natives of Fiji in 1898. In the former
of these two cases—that reported by Col. Gudgeon—the reporter expressly
states that the priest said to Mr. Goodwin : " I hand my mana (power)
over to you, lead your friends across," that they then "stepped boldly"
across the fiery surface and three of the four Europeans got across un
scathed, while one was badly burnt who, like Lot's wife, "looked behind
him," i.e. probably, lost courage and began to think of bolting. The
Colonel adds : " A man must have mana to do it ; if he has not, it will
be too late when he is on the hot stone of Tama-ahi-roa." In the second
case Dr. Hocken mentions " intense faith " as a possible explanation, though
he thinks it highly improbable, for he finds it "difficult to see how any
mental state can prevent the action of physical law." Difficult indeed !
Nevertheless it may be that the Neoplatonic philosopher is not wholly
wrong when he speaks of 6 Mar Se&s as the real explanation of the pheno
menon : " they walk on fire unharmed, for the god within them does not
270 E. N. Bennett. [PAET
let fire barm them." If ou the positive side auto-suggestion can produce
" stigmata," or suggestion ab extra can cause the touch of a cold ruler on
a bare arm to elicit a cry of pain, or (Cp. Proceedings, vol. vii. p. 204,
pp. 337-345), actually raise a blister, can it be that on the negative side
a similar condition, call it "full assurance," "faith," "mana"—what you
will—may even avail to avert for a time the heat, of the glowing stones,
from the skin of a fire-walker? How came it that Home's ied-hot cinder
felt cool in one person's hand, while it raised a painful blister on that
of another? Was the poor clergyman whose hand was permanently scarred
by the cinder utterly lacking in the essential mana, or had he forgotten
to put on Mr. Podmore's asbestos glove ?
So much as to the explanation of the phenomenon, when the available
evidence appears to show conclusively that the heat of the material trodden
upon was so intense as to char and destroy the skin of a human being
coming in contact with it under normal conditions. The interesting paper,
however, contributed by Professor Langley (see Journal S.P.R., October,
1901) has proved clearly that the upper layer of stones in an exhibition
of fire-walking which he witnessed in Tahiti was not nearly so hot as it
appeared to be. The basaltic stones in question were such poor conductors
of heat that even when the lower portion had become red hot, it was
possible to step rapidly over the upper surface without much inconvenience.
There can be no doubt that Mr. Langley in dealing with the fire-walk
before him has proved his point, that "it was not a miracle"; for the
misprint about the specific gravity of the stone does not really invalidate
his conclusions. Indeed, at first sight, the reader of Mr. Langley's paper
feels inclined to believe that he has before him the true explanation of
every recorded instance of the "fire-walk." The intense heat underneath,
the spurts of flame shooting up from the interstices of the stones, the
comparative coolness of the surface presented to the feet of a cautious
walker—all these factors seem to show how a man can step across the
furnace with safety, while a handkerchief falling into it is charred, a
timid performer, losing his head, blunders between the stones and is badly
burnt, or a boy slipping down is actually killed by the flames.
But despite the prima facie appearance of comprehensiveness attached
to Mr. Langley's evidence, and the irrelevancy of Mr. Lang's criticism
that the fire-walker in the case cited was a "travelling performer," there
yet remains a considerable mass of testimony which does not appear to-
be overthrown by Mr. Langley's experiments and observations. Even
setting aside all cases in which stones are employed for the oven, how
are we to account for the immunity from injury enjoyed by the Nistinares
of Bulgaria or the fire-walkers of Mauritius and Japan 1 In these instances
there is good evidence to show that the performers tread with naked
feet upon glowing embers. Colonel Haggard relates that at Tokio in
1899 "people of all ages walked through red-hot charcoal." Mrs, Schwabe,
a-n eye-witness of a fire-walk in Mauritius (see Journal S.P.R., December,
1901), speaks of "masses of red-hot embers to the depth of several inches
XLiv.J Review. 271
. . . the radiant heat of which was almost unbearable . . . several yards
from the trench." A number of large logs carefully arranged might, of
course, be red-hot underneath and fairly cool on the upper surface ; but
this is not the impression conveyed by the above testimony, which seems
to imply the existence of a glowing mass of embers after the logs and
brushwood had been disintegrated by the preliminary blaze.
Some very interesting matter is covered by the appendices to Mr. Lang's
volume. The strange story of St. Dasius' martyrdom is brought forward
by the author of the Golden Bough to show that, as late as the reign
of Diocletian, a yearly feast to Kronos (i.e. the Saturnalia) was celebrated
in which a man selected by lot was "clad in royal raiment and allowed thirty
days of revelry, after which he was to sacrifice himself at the altar of
Kronos." The tale itself is amplified in one MS. with a mass of that
ecclesiastical padding so familiar to readers of the Vitae Sanctorum,
but it is doubtful if Mr. Lang has really succeeded in undermining the
conclusion drawn by Mr. Frazer,—that the slaying of a victim at the
Saturnalia was still known of and occasionally practised as late as the close
of the third century. Such a practice was, no doubt, at the time ex
ceedingly rare, but unless the narrator of the martyrdom was aware of
its existence, it is difficult to understand why he introduced it into his
narrative at all. All that is stated is that, at the obscure frontier town
of Dorostolum, such a yearly festival was held and the garrison fell in
with the local observances, as was frequently the case (cp. inscriptions
upon altars found along the Roman wall and elsewhere passim), and selected
one of their own number, Dasius, as the victim. Whether he was a
Christian or a pagan, whether or not he was insolent to the legatus, is
irrelevant to the main point—that, unless the narrator contradicts himself
egregioualy, the young soldier was selected as a victim of the Saturnalia.
As to the third appendix, which deals with the momentous question
whether the events of the Crucifixion week can be identified with certain
alleged customs in vogue at the Feast of Pnrim, Mr. Lang has ably
demonstrated the one great weakness of Mr. Frazer's theory, viz., the
difference of date between Purim and Holy week. The question is alto
gether too large for treatment within the limits of this review ; but it
is perhaps worth while to call attention to a small textual point which
is not noticed by either Mr. Lang or Mr. Frazer. Origen, as well as
Jerome, was undoubtedly cognizant of the MS. reading 'l-qaow [rii-] BapapfHiv
1j 'liIaoSv Ti>v Xe-yo/io'ox Xpurrdf. Despite the absence of much extrinsic evi
dence for the authenticity of this strange text, the intrinsic evidence is
very great ; there would be every reason for altering the text in question,
none whatever for inventing it. If then the sentence originally ran, " Shall
I liberate unto you Jesus [the] Barabbas or Jesus called Christ?" how
much colour might be lent to Mr. Frazer's theory 1 Of the two prisoners
named Jesus, one had been selected to play the part of " Barabbas "—the
"Son of the Father"—who was to be crowned, scourged, and ultimately
slain ; the other was to be set free. But Pilate's humane purpose was

frustrated by the criea of the populace, hounded on by the priests to
clamour for the blood of an innocent man. And so it came to pass that
the original arrangement made by the governor was upset, the criminal
Jesus was liberated, the sinless Jesus became the "Barabbas."

Dreams and their Meanings, by HORACE G. HUTCHINSOX. (London : Long
mans, Green & Co., 1901. 8vo, pp. 320 ; price, 9s. 6d. net.)
This is a book which seems to have made itself to a considerable extent.
It has grown out of an article published by the author in Longmans' Magazine
on "Common Dreams." This caused a deluge of letters to descend on
Mr. Hutchinson's head, and about one-third of the present work is based
on these letters. The last two chapters, which make up rather more than
another third, are from the hand of a collaborator whose fervent faith •was
held to mark him out as a fit and proper person to deal with telepathic and
premonitory dreams. The remaining eighty pages, from the hand of Mr.
Hutchinson, deal in a somewhat less than exhaustive manner with what
science has to say about dreams, with the bearing of dreams on the question
of the origin of religion, with divination, and with interpretations of
dreams—a collection of facts that would have been better placed in the
chapter on divination.
The book does not pretend to be more than a popular work, and it would
be unfair to judge it by scientific standards. Even in a popular work, how
ever, we might have expected to find some reference to the subliminal
consciousness. There does not seem to be a mention of it in the first part of
the book, however. A little research in the publications of the S.P.R. would
have enabled the author to produce a book that would have been at once
more interesting to the general reader and more useful. By directing
attention to such questions as automatic waking at a specified hour, he
might have induced his readers to bring together a large amount of useful
material.
With the work of the collaborator—a member of the S.P.R., who prefers
to be nameless—it is unnecessary to deal at great length. The materials are
taken mainly from the Proceedings, but are used in an uncritical spirit, which
gives the unpsychical reviewer only tot> much occasion to lift up the finger of
scorn. He suggests, for example, that the finding of lost articles through
dreams can only be explained on the theory that " our spirit is conducted by
so-called occult means to the place where the lost article is reposing." In the
chapter on premonitory dreams we see evidence of the same fault. Two of
the dreams classed as premonitory (pp. 273, 293) seem to be merely telepathic ;
the case on p. 291 does not of necessity involve any more occult source of
information than the subliminal consciousness ; and the same may, perhaps
be said of the cases on pp. 287 and 289. Beyond a vague statement that the
details of the dream on p. 280 were the same as those of the subsequent
accident, there is nothing to show that the dream had any connection with
XLIV.] Review. 273
the accident : even if it could be shown that the details were in substantial
agreement, they are such as might apply to many collisions at sea. But
perhaps the most staggering point about the whole chapter is the statement,
quoted from the Report on the Census of Hallucinations, where it refers
to telepathic cases, that premonitory dreams are proved. But so far from
this being the view of the Committee, they expressly say on p. 331 that
the cases with which they deal afford no adequate justification for taking
this view, which introduces vast difficulties. There can be no excuse for a
misstatement of this kind. It is clear that the statistical inquiry which
was necessary to demonstrate the existence of spontaneous telepathy is far
more necessary in the case of premonitory dreams ; the chance coincidences
will in the latter case, apart from the complications introduced by the greater
complexity of dreams, be more numerous in proportion as dreams are more
numerous than waking hallucinations. At present belief in premonitions
is only a superstition. N. W. THOMAS.
Elementeder Empirische Teteologie,\<jn Paul Nicolaus Cossmann (Stuttgart,
A. Zimmer's Verlag, 1899).
I wish to draw attention to this book as one of the most important that
has appeared during the last few years. It was published in ]899, but I
think it will come to be considered as one of the first signs of dawn of the
new scientific spirit of our present century.
lu fact, in its modest appearance and dry form, it seems to me of no less
importance for us than the essay of Mayer on the conservation of energy was
for the 19th century. It does what every work of high merit has done,—it
formulates what has been in the scientific mind for a long time in a vague
indefinite fashion. It is the scientific revival of teleology after a long night
mare of determinism—not, however, the old-fashioned teleology, but teleology
in a new and deeper sense.
It contains nothing new, nothing of which a philosopher would not say :
indeed, we knew this long ago. And yet it is entirely new in its thoroughly
scientific method of treatment.
Henceforth no man of science who wishes to escape the name of amateur<
will be able to proclaim determinism as the principle of natural science, and
to discard teleology as purely metaphysical and mystical. Teleology will be
henceforth a scientific principle unavoidably required ; no researcher will be
able to do without it. And this is the result of Cossmann's work.
Besides causal relations, nature shows teleological relations of facts. In a
causal relation, two co-operating causes a and b form the result c, a and 6 being
constant, c being exclusively determined by a and b. In a teleological
relation a and c are constant, and determine the secondary cause b.
These two forms of relation do not exclude each other, but exist together.
The causal relation is always there, but it is not alone. The teleological relation
does not exist without causality, yet it is not causality.
To give an instance : The protective colour of a butterfly is a link in a
274 N. W. Thomas. [PART
teleological relation, yet it could not exist if the chemical matter which forms
the colour was not present in the animal, as a causal factor.
And I consider it a stroke of genius in Cossmann's work to draw a definite
distinction between what we call living and non-living nature with regard to
the teleological relationship. In this way the old contention about vitalism
is finally settled, a simple, clear and scientific definition being given, which
cannot be mistaken nor lead to error ; to the effect, namely, that in natural
sciences we distinguish two series of observable facts—one series (non-living
nature) which is without a teleological relation, the other series (living nature)
which is invariably related tdeologically as well as causally.

Fact and Fancy in Spiritualism, Theosophy, and P«ychical Research, by
G. C. HUBBELL. (Cincinnati : Robert Clarke Co., 1901. 8vo, pp. vi. +9-208.)
This work is the outcome of a series of lectures delivered by the author
before the Ohio Liberal Society of Cincinnati. The four lectures which com
pose it were not originally destined for publication, as the author informs us,
and have apparently undergone little or no revision, with the natural result
that there is a certain lack of continuity and an occasional want of firmness
of treatment. This does not, however, detract seriously from the interest of
the book, which is not intended to be more than a popular exposition of the
subject. It will be found eminently readable by amateurs, who will not
only appreciate the easy style in which it is written, but may also profit by
the sane view taken by Mr. Hubbell.
The first three chapters deal with Madame Blavatsky, and with the bearing
of the results hitherto attained in Psychical Research on the questions of
belief in a future life and on the materialistic theory ; in a final chapter,
based to some extent on personal experience, the author gives some account
of the frauds of Spiritualism, but at the same time suggests that there is an
element which neither fraud nor hallucination can explain. In some of his
remarks on Spiritualism Mr. Hubbell hardly eeems to appreciate the extent
to which our standards of evidence have risen during the past twenty-five
years. He quotes the experiments of De Qasparin and the Dialectical
Society, together with those of Sir W. Crookes, in proof of his assertion that
" the movement of ponderable objects without physical contact, such move
ment displaying intelligence, ... is established beyond all question." In
view of our increased knowledge of the possibilities of fraud and of the falli
bility of human testimony, even if we make allowance for the fact that thr
experiments took place under specially favourable conditions and that Home
was never detected in trickery, this expression is too strong. It may be that
Home was exceptional in his gifts, and that we can for this reason hardly
hope for speedy confirmation of the observations of Sir W. Crookes ; but
that confirmation is needed the experimenter himself would probably be the
first to admit.
In the chapter on Psychical Research and a Future Life, the author,
XLIV.] Review. 275
after dealing with the Piper case, goes ou to explain the bearing of the
theory of telepathy on the belief in a future state of existence, but his argu
ment hardly carries conviction. On p. 99 he states that the fundamental
contention of materialism—that body and mind are so connected and related
that the action of the mind is entirely confined to the body, and dies with
the body—is shaken, if not overthrown (presumably by the fact of telepathy).
But even if it is not true, as the author expressly states on p. 129, that
telepathy can in all probability be explained in terms of matter and motion,
i.e. on a materialistic hypothesis,—it is clear that we have in telepathy from
the living no basis for arguing that the soul will survive death. Perhaps the
passage iu question is intended to apply rather to the Piper case, but if this
is so, the choice of words is unfortunate. The argument should clearly be
based, not on the telepathic, but on the spiritistic theory. It may be that
both the telepathic and the spiritistic hypotheses involve telepathy ; but
the important fact, from Mr. Hubbell's point of view, is in this case not
telepathy, but the source from which the telepathic impulse comes. The
question is naturally one which will appeal to many of Mr. Hubbell's
readers, and it is a pity that he should not have made his point quite clear.

SOME EXPERIMENTS IN HYPNOTISM.
BY "EDWARD GREENWOOD."
[It must be explained that the author of the following paper—a
gentleman well known to the Editor and to the Council of the
Society—has adopted the pseudonym of " Edward Greenwood " in
order not to risk betraying the identity of his friend "M.," the
subject, by disclosing his own. It is for this reason that the Council
has sanctioned the appearance of the paper under a pseudonym.—
EDITOR.]
I offer the following notes of a series of experiments in hypnotism
with my friend M. with some diffidence, aware that they contain
no such circumstances of exceptional importance as would perhaps
alone justify their being brought forward now that the general
phenomena have been so completely examined and described. The
results achieved in this series do not transcend those which may
usually be expected with a fairly susceptible subject. The fact,
however, that the experiments were conducted with an educated
subject, himself greatly interested in the development of phenomena
with which he had previously been unacquainted, and to the examina
tion of which he was able to bring an acute and discriminating
intelligence, and an unusual power of self-analysis, lends them a
certain interest. It is, in my experience, so rare that an operator
finds himself assisted in this way by a subject, at once thoroughly
trustworthy and normal, while possessing a high degree of hypnotic
susceptibility, that I am encouraged to think the results may not
be unworthy of description.
My friend M. is a young man aged 22, quick and alert in mind,
and of an enthusiastic and decidedly nervous temperament, highly
idealistic and with considerable literary gifts. At present engaged
in teaching, he has much influence with boys, in his treatment of
whom he shows both initiative and judgment. He is interested in

athletic pursuits and takes as much part in them as constitutional
weakness of the lungs will allow. Formerly afflicted with consumption,
this disease, which was taken in time and is no longer active, has left
him physically delicate and incapacitated for much bodily effort. It
also, no doubt, left his nervous system in a somewhat hypersensitive
condition. I wish, however, to emphasise the fact that he is essentially
normal and responsible, of robust character and of decided intellectual
ability.
Having witnessed one or two simple hypnotic experiments, M.
evinced much interest in the subject, but at first expressed dis
inclination to submit to any himself. On the question subsequently
recurring in conversation, however, I asked to be allowed to test
his susceptibility, engaging at the same time to refrain from any
experiment. He consented, and after a very short procedure, I
succeeded in closing his eyes. As soon as I had demonstrated his
inability to open them, I immediately restored him to his normal
state, but, interested by this small experience, he appeared to lose
his former distaste, and thereupon invited me to test systematically
the extent of the influence. This, then, was the genesis of the
series of experiments, some 20 or 30 in number, which I now have
it in hand to describe.
The actual process of hypnotisation has always been of the most
simple and rapid description. Almost from the first, it has only
been necessary, after he has composed himself for the experiment,
to say the word " sleep," and he immediately passes into the hypnotic
state. The trance is not a deep one ; he retains full consciousness
of himself, and his mental powers undergo no change, except in so
far as he is amenable to suggestions given by myself. His memory,
after awakening, is practically continuous, and while he is, during
the trance, otherwise completely susceptible to post-hypnotic sugges
tion, I am wholly unable, by this means, to produce any lasting
break between his hypnotic and his normal consciousness. In the
course of the experiments, the character of the trance underwent
several changes to which I shall later refer. His degree of suscepti
bility has, however, not varied ; certain limitations to my power of
suggestion presented themselves in the first experiments, and have
not since been modified.
It is not my purpose to describe in detail the experiments in which
we engaged, except in so far as may be necessary in order to give
M.'s own description of his sensations while undergoing them. The
experiments were of the ordinary character: all attempts to produce
XLV.] Some Experiments in Hypnotism. 281
any of the higher class of alleged phenomena, such as thought-
transference, clairvoyance, or even augmentation of the faculties of
sense, being complete failures.
I now proceed to give a general account of M.'s condition.
The injunction to sleep immediately places him in a state of sug
gestibility. In the latter experiments he passed directly into this
state without any apparent external change whatever taking place ;
though in the earlier experiments, the change was marked by the
involuntary closing of the eyes, which he immediately asked, and
obtained, permission to open again. Beyond a slight alteration in
his manner, imperceptible to a third person who was not forewarned,
and frequently difficult even for myself to appreciate, there is, ever
since the first few experiments, no external difference between his
trance and his normal condition. During the former, however, he
is physically completely under my control, any movement being
either inhibited by the merest gesture on my part, or performed in
obedience to an expressed wish. M. tells me that he experiences
no sense of compulsion by me :—an inhibited movement seeming to
be inhibited at its source in his will. Thus, if I tell him that he
cannot do a certain thing, he agrees. If I then desire him to try
to do it, he explains that he could make the movement if he wished,
but that he does not wish. If I then desire him to wish it, he
declines. Similarly, an action which I tell him to perform is performed
apparently as a free exercise of his own will, and because he prefers
to perform it, and the full consciousness that it is a suggestion from
myself makes no difference to the sensation of free choice. I have,
however, been able to show him that a suggestion to perform some
indifferent action such as to sit in a particular chair, or to reveal
the position of a hidden coin, which he had previously, while in his
normal state, at my instance deliberately made up his mind he would
not perform, and which he still objected to perform in his trance
state, could nevertheless not be resisted if sufficiently often reiterated.
His sensuous suggestibility is strictly limited to certain only of
the senses. Taking in order the various senses, I found that I could
affect them as follows :
(1.) The sense of sight proved quite insusceptible. I could neither
suggest a visual hallucination, nor produce any hallucinated variations
of colour or form, nor render invisible a present object.
(2.) The sense of hearing was also refractory. I could neither
produce a hallucinated sound, nor render real sounds inaudible,
(3.) Smell and taste were under my control, and I could either
282 Edward Greenwood. [PART
produce a feeling of nausea by suggesting an abominable odour, or
vary the taste of things that he might eat or drink. A glass of
water took on, according to my direction, the taste of spirits or of
wine, followed, if so suggested, by appearances of complete intoxica
tion. A piece of soap which I informed him was of rarest quality,
and tasted like chocolate, he ate with much relish till I suddenly woke
him up. This experiment was proposed by himself, and he retained
throughout the full consciousness that, in point of fact, the soap
was soap, and not chocolate.
(4.) As regards the sense of feeling, I was able to produce, but
not abolish, the sensation of pain. Thus, while I failed to produce
ansesthesia, even to the slightest degree, a suggestion that his chair
was hot, or that he had a toothache, would succeed. He would explain
during its continuance, that he knew the suggestion was false, and
that the pain was not genuinely felt, that the symptoms of discomfort
which he exhibited seemed to proceed direct from the suggestion,
and the actual discomfoit to be deduced from the symptoms. Thus
a suggestion that there was a pin in his chair caused him to move
uneasily, and to be unable to stop doing so. He said that nevertheless
he did not actually feel the physical sensation of pricking, but merely
a kind of localized moral discomfort consequent upon his inability
to cease showing the uneasiness due to the suggestion of a physical
one. A curious result was obtained by giving a suggestion affecting
senses respectively subject, and refractory to, my influence. Thus
a declaration that he was on the bank of a river and required to
cross to the other side, to be fully successful, would involve a visual
hallucination—which, as before explained, I was unable to produce—
and a tactile hallucination (which was within my power). While
seeing nothing before him but the carpet, therefore, he nevertheless
felt, on stepping on it, the coldness of the water, and while perfectly
conscious that there was no visible river, he found it necessary,
when told to cross, spontaneously to take off his shoes and stockings,
and roll up his trousers in order to avoid the irresistible suggestion
of getting wet. He protested at the same time against the absurdity
of his doing so, but explained that he found the precaution followed
inevitably from the fear of the sensation of wet.
Suggested impersonations were also fully executed, unless they
trenched too blatantly upon the absurd. Thus a suggestion that M.
was myself, and that I was he. succeeded ; and in his reversed capacity
he continued a course of experiments upon myself, devising several
original and ingenious varieties to which I, for the sake of the game,
XLV.] Some Experiments in Hypnotism. 283
acquiesced in subjecting myself. He also behaved with considerable
dignity and verve as King Edward VII., until I threw a match at
his head, a proceeding which appeared to conflict so strongly with
dramatic verisimilitude that he lapsed back into his ordinary hypnotic
condition, nor could I reinduce the impersonation. On the other
hand, statements that he was the Empress of China, and that he
was a nurse and I a baby, failed to carry any conviction, being
either received with a passive assent, or rejected with scorn. In his
waking state he explained that he was inly conscious that in point
of fact he was not the characters that he was bidden to assume,
and that if asked he would have said as much, but that he was
irresistibly impelled to act as though he were.
I have stated that M. is highly susceptible to post-hypnotic
suggestions. The execution of such suggestions is somewhat curious.
Since I am unable to affect the continuity of his memory, he is
aware, when awaked, of the fact that a suggestion is impending ;
he is also aware while executing it of the fact that it is a suggestion,
though it may be that if there is a considerable interval of time
before the suggestion is due the memory of it will fade from his
mind, to revive when the time has come. The following instance
is of some interest. I told him on one occasion that next day
I would ask him to walk with me in the garden, and that when
there I would ofter him a book, and ask him to read me a passage
out of it, but that he would only find himself able to read every
alternate word. The following morning, when we went forth, he
had a copy of Punch in his hand. I asked him if it contained
anything good, and, if so, to read it to me. He forthwith, and
something to my disappointment, read me a set of verses without
a flaw. I then produced my own book, directed his attention to
a passage, and asked him to read it aloud. He started doing so,
reading, however, only every alternate word, and presently stopped,
saying he could not understand what it was all about.
I asked him if he was aware that he was executing a post-hypnotic
suggestion. He said that he had forgotten about it, but that he
now remembered it clearly. I then asked him to try whether, with
the full consciousness that he was the victim of a mere suggestion,
he would still be forced to submit to it. The result showed the
influence to be unaltered. He said that he was aware that there
was something in between the words which he read, but that they
conveyed no meaning to his mind ; so that while reading aloud he
failed to grasp the meaning of the passage ; but that if he read it
284 Edward Greenwood. [PART
to himself he understood it without difficulty. As an instance of
the accuracy with which the suggestion had operated, it appeared
that if he selected a passage himself he was able to read it
correctly, whereas if I selected it, though it might be the same
passage, he could make nothing of it.
As a contribution to the question as to whether, during the
execution of a post-hypnotic suggestion a subject lapses back into
the hypnotic state, I may here mention that on my way into the
garden I bent over a rhododendron and declared that it smelt of
vanilla. He expressed surprise that it should do so, tested it him
self, and agreed. On our way back, after the close of the reading
experiment, he again paused at this rhododendron to smell it, but
found it had lost its scent. He then immediately realized that its
first perception of it was due to a suggestion. But this sugges
tibility did not extend to orders which were more obviously
suggestions, except during the actual execution of the post-hypnotic
command. Thus I found that, while he was actually engaged in
trying to read a selected passage, I could inhibit any movement
by a sudden direction to that effect, but that when he ceased
reading I was unable to continue the inhibition. If the post-hypnotic
suggestion is to be executed shortly after it was given, so that the
memory of it does not escape him, the mode of execution is some
thing as follows : I tell him that three minutes after waking he will
get up and sit on my kneee. Then I wake him.
" Oh, so I'm to sit on your knee, am I ? "
" Yes, do you feel as if you were going to ? "
" Not in the least ; I never felt less inclined to do anything
in my life."
Then we talk of other things. Presently he says :
" Do you know, I do begin to feel as if I should like to sit on
your knee. But I won't."
Then a little later :
" I say, I really feel a most extraordinary wish to sit on your
knee. I know I sha'n't be happy till I do. You mustn't mind. I
really think I'd better." . . .
And he does.
I should here state that owing to M.'s ready susceptibility I
began to fear I might acquire an influence which would be in
convenient both to him and to me, and so enjoined that thenceforth,
whether he wished it or no, I should be unable to hypnotise him
unless he previously recited a formula asking me to do so, in a
XLV.] Some Experiments in Hypnotism. 285
particular form of words. After several failures 1 eventually
succeeded in impressing this so strongly upon him that it became
absolutely effective, and the formula proved requisite before I could,
even with the utmost co-operation on his part, influence him in
the least. One night, however, after retiring to bed, I was
surprised by his entering the room with the request that I should
awaken him. I expressed astonishment, and asked whether he was
really asleep. He assured me that he was, and explained that
while we had been conversing in the drawing-room after dinner,
other persons being present, he had experimentally recited the
formula, solto voce, and had immediately, unperceived by myself or
the others in the room, gone off into the hypnotic state, and could
not get out of it again. I protested that this was an extremely
unfair trick both on himself and on me, and to guard against its
recurrence I enjoined that in future a mere repetition of the
formula should not suffice, but that it must be formally written
down, signed, and handed to me. This has hitherto proved com
pletely effective, and in the absence of the document no efforts
on the part of either of us, however much prolonged, have any
result whatever.
I will now describe what appears to me the most interesting feature
in M.'s development, viz. the variations that have taken place in his
demeanour in the hypnotic state. During the first two or three
hypnotizations, his secondary condition was very markedly different
from his normal state. His sight seemed dim, and his eyes wore a
vague and distant look. His demeanour was heavy, his movements
slow, and his manner of speech low, restrained, and quite devoid of
its usual vivacity. He exhibited extreme nervousness; the slightest
sound caused him to start, and on one occasion, at the sight of a beetle
(I was never able to determine whether this animal was real or the
creature of self-hallucination), fled across the room in a paroxysm of
terror, from which I had some ado to recall him to calmness. Towards
myself he exhibited much repugnance, disliking that I should touch or
even approach him. I appeared to him in a mist, and as wearing a
horrible aspect, with diabolic eyes ; nor could any suggestion restore
me to favour in his sight. Further, his range of vision was consider
ably diminished. Whereas his normal reading distance is about
1J ft., he found himself unable to read a book at a greater distance
than 6 ins.
After the third experiment many of these symptoms changed. He
completely lost his fear of myself, his general nervousness vanished,
286 Edward 0-reenwood. [PART
his condition was no longer comatose and languid, but resembled very
closely his normal state. His speech was indeed somewhat slower, his
manner more restrained than was usual in his normal state, but a
casual observer would scarcely have recognized anything abnormal.
One evening, some time after the establishment of this as his ordinary
hypnotic condition, he surprised me by suddenly behaving in quite a
different manner. He became extremely hilarious and absurd, jested
in an easy way, displayed a tendency for practical jokes upon myself,
kicked my clothes about the room, and was generally obstreperous and
fantastic, both in his speech and behaviour. I met him in the same
spirit till in a moment, without warning, he reverted to his former
habit—quiet, speculative, and restrained. Later on, in the same
evening, a further relapse into his jocose vein took place. The complete
difference between the two conditions, the absolute contrast of the
whole manner of the man as presented in each respectively, the
alteration in his expression, conduct, and mode of speech, the sudden
and unexpected way in which the change took place, sometimes in the
middle of a sentence, involving frequently a break in his thought, and
u cessation and repudiation of what he had just been saying, brought
me tentatively to regard these variations as a kind of embryonic
specimen of multiple personality.
In course of time further variants developed, quite spontaneously,
each differing markedly from any other. These moods, if I may so
call them, do not attain to the dignity of the personalities in the
classic cases of Leonie or of Louis V., for example, and indeed M.
disclaims for them anything in the nature of distinct personalities.
He is conscious of complete continuity between them, a continuity
far more perfect than that between his waking and hypnotic con
ditions. Their appearance is beyond his control, and independent
of my suggestion, though I have found I can produce one or other
of them at will. It is, he explains, as though he were a magic-
lantern, with many-coloured slides passing in sequence before his
eyes, so that he looks out upon the world, and thinks and feels
regarding it, through a constantly changing medium. For it is not
only in externalities that these moods vary from one another : they
carry with them each a different set of emotions, tastes, and a different
mental attitude. For reference, they may be christened as follows :
(A) the "nervous" mood, i.e. the one in which appeared during the
first three hypnotizations. (I may perhaps be wrong in classifying this
as a distinct mood. He has never since lapsed back into it, and I have
not attempted to reproduce it by suggestion.)
XLV.] Some Experiments in Hypnotism. ' 287
(B) the "ordinary" or "quiet" mood, which during a considerable
portion of the series was the only one that appeared.
(C) the " malicious " mood, of which I shall speak later.
(D) the " gay " mood, almost identical with (C), except that there
appears no aggressive wish to do injury.
(E) the "depressed " mood, in which he expresses himself as utterly
and beyond bounds miserable, and ready for no reason to burst into
tears. The following are some instances of the complete change that
these varying moods involve : While in his normal state he is a man
of gentle nature, in his " malicious " mood he expresses a strong wish
to inflict pain, and frequently asks me to allow him to stab me in order
to give him the satisfaction of seeing the blood flow. Indeed, I have
often detected him surreptitiously extracting a penknife from his
pocket, with a view to gratifying this peculiar and alarming inclination.
He confesses to a wish to vivisect, or, failing that, to strangle. I gave
him permission on one occasion to do his worst, and he made so
determined an attempt on me with a towel round my throat that I
was forced to bid him forego the remainder of the experiment. Again,
while in his normal waking state a person of well-bred and courteous
demeanour, and a religious and idealistic temperament, in his " gay "
mood he displays an astounding lack of the ordinary conventions or
proprieties, professes a complete contempt for either religion or
morality, and a disregard for any responsibility in his actions, becomes,
in his own phrase, a child of nature, non-moral, though not vicious.
If I offer a suggestion not in consonance with the particular mood he
may be in, I may insist upon its execution quite vainly so long as he
continues in that mood. If, however, I procure a change in the mood
itself—a change which it is beyond his power to resist—he is im
mediately ready to fall in with the suggestion. Thus, if he is in his
" ordinary " or " quiet " mood, and I suggest something of which he
disapproves, no amount of insistence on my part will avail to get him
to perform it. I then say : " Very well, I will put you into your
' gay ' mood, and then you will not object." He may protest against
the change, but vainly. I say : " When I count 5 you will pass into
the 'gay' mood. 1—2—3—4—5!" Immediately a change passes
over his face ; he generally rises from his chair, rollicks about the
room, and professes himself ready to execute even the most preposterous
suggestions of which he had scouted the very idea only the moment
before.
M.'s waking memory of what passes in his hypnotic state, while
always continuous, was, as I have elsewhere indicated, subject in the
288* Edward Greenwood. [PART
earlier experiments to occasional intermissions. Towards the close of
the series, however, the continuity became perfect, and he is therefore
able to pass in review, during his waking state, the various " moods "
in which he has undergone his hypnotic adventures. Though he may
feel surprise, from his waking standpoint, at his having expressed such
and such a sentiment, or done such and such an action while in one of
these moods, his memory is perfect, not only of the sentiment or action
itself, but also of the emotions and points of view accompanying them.
We soon began to discuss, in his waking state, the probable limits of
his acquiescence to distasteful suggestions, as it began to seem likely
that, granting that they were given while he was in an appropriate
mood, there might be no limits at all. And at first we both came to
the conclusion that this was probably the case.
I obtained his permission to test this more systematically, and we
arranged to try the effect of certain suggestions, certain of which
were proposed by himself, and to which he agreed that in his
waking state he would feel the strongest objections. I found at
first that if I gave such a suggestion in his " ordinary " or " quiet "
mood he would flatly refuse to execute it, and be rather indignant
at my insistence. Nor could any power cause him to yield. If I
then put him into his " gay " mood, he at once expressed surprise
at his former objection and explained it on the ground that he had
been in his " quiet " mood, for the prejudices of which, he declared,
there was no accounting, and for which, in his " gay " mood, he
appears to entertain the same kind of contempt that a music-hall
manager would for the London County Council. Short of the obvious
limitations that must be imposed on experimentation of this kind,
even the most repugnant suggestions have, by this device, gained
acceptance It is impossible, in practice, to prove how far this kind of
thing really will go, or to put to the test an actually criminal or
immoral action. Nor have I been sufficiently heroic to test whether,
in point of fact, M. would really vivisect me, if permitted, or stab me in
the jugular or strangle me, though I am inclined, from certain indications
of the fundamental change of instinct that takes place, to believe his
assurance that he would do it with the greatest delight.
Admitting the weakness of any evidence short of such experiment
ation, I cannot but express my own belief that when M. assured me
that, no matter how repugnant an action might be to him in his
waking state, it would cease to be so if suggested, or permitted,
while he was in an appropriate mood, he was probably correct in
his statement. It is true that later experiments caused us both to
XLV.] Some Experiments in Hypnotism.
modify our conclusion as to the absolute irresistibility of these sug
gestions, and on the last occasion on which any such were tried he
opposed to my most artful endeavours a completely successful
resistance. And this, notwithstanding the fact that the particular
suggestion was one to which on a former occasion I had easily
gained his acquiescence, and which, in his waking state, he had just
consented to my trying to repeat. I think, however, that this forti
fication of his power of resistance may be traced to my frequent
references to the matter in his waking state, and to my repeated
requests that he should resolve to try and resist to the uttermost.
It is the first occasion in my own experience that I have observed
the phenomena presented in these so-called " moods " to which M. is
subject, and I am not aware of a similar condition having previously
been described elsewhere. It is therefore impossible to argue from
this particular case to the general. It is accordingly to this particular
case that 1 must limit my conclusion, which is, repugnant and
unexpected as I confess it to be, that, in the hands of an unscrupulous
operator, there was at one period of the experiment possibly no limit
to the acquiescence that might, by artful procedure, have been induced
to suggestions which, in his normal state, would be highly distasteful
to the subject ; and that the moral prepossessions which are usually
considered to be ample safeguards against a misuse of the power of
suggestion would have been, in this case at all events, an insufficient
protection. And I am of opinion that even now it is by no means
improbable that suggestions which, though repugnant to him in his
waking state, are spontaneously consonant to him, say in his "mali
cious " mood,—such, for example, as a suggestion to stab or to
strangle,—might not most blithe-heartedly be acted upon.

MALAY SPIRITUALISM.
BY WALTER SKEAT.
[THE following is part of a paper which appeared under the above
title in Folk-Lore, Vol. XIIL, No. 2, June, 1902, and is here reprinted
by the kind permission of the Council of the Folk-Lore Society. The
paper was read at the General Meeting of the Society for Psychical
Research on May 30th, 1902.—EDITOR.]
When I recently had the honour of being invited by the Council to
read a paper before this Society,i I had nothing ready which seemed
suitable for the purpose. It appeared to me, however, that it would
be a useful piece of work to bring together in one paper the main facts
concerning the spiritualistic beliefs of the Peninsular Malays, with
special reference to motor automatisms of the type of the Divining-Rod,
where the motions of an inert object in contact with a human being
may be regarded as externalisations of subconscious knowledge. Out
of this idea the present paper has grown.2 I shall therefore now
endeavour in the first place to put the details of the Malay per
formances before you as clearly as possible. I shall then proceed to
state the problem, in so far as it concerns ethnology, and shall only
refer incidentally to the few, and, I fear, somewhat negative results
which may be of general psychical interest. Speaking generally, most
forms of spiritualism known to us in Europe are most likely known in
some form or other to Malay magicians, even though they may not all
have been yet recorded. Devil-dancing is practised, and apparitions
and what may be called Pelting Spirits (PoUergeister) are certainly
most strongly believed in. Houses are left uninhabited on account of
phenomena of the classes referred to, and I myself once lived for many

this paper, I am indebted to Mr. N. W. Thomas.

months in a Malay house which, according to the Malays, was unmis
takably haunted.
Of spirit-writing and levitation, no purely Malay accounts are yet to
hand. It would be unsafe to assume the absence of the first till we
know for certain if there is any really automatic form of planchette
practised in China, beside the case described by Professor Giles as long
ago as 1879, in which a poem was composed for the writers. As to
the second, there are many references in Malay literature to the flying
performances of Malayan heroes, whilst to this day it is alleged in
Selangor that people possessed by the Pontianak ! (one of the tremen
dous birth-demons of Malay tradition), acquire supernatural powers,
enabling them to climb trees of immense height and to walk in
safety along branches which are no thicker than a man's thumb, a
manifest impossibility under normal conditions. A similar power is
also claimed for the young girls who perform what the Malays call
the Monkey-dance, in which, however, they are possessed by the
Monkey-spirit.
The burning of incense and recital of a charm called Piruang enables
Malay magicians to walk upon water without sinking in it beyond the
ankles. A similar charm in the case of the Malay form of ordeal by
diving enables the innocent party to remain under water for an
incredible period, which, according to the Malays, sometimes extended
to "almost" three-quarters of an hour, in fact in some cases (it was
declared) he would remain under water until the spectators lost
patience and dragged him out, whereas the guilty party begins to
choke immediately. A magician from Perak informed me once that he
had used the power of causing a sandbank to rise at sea between his
own boat and that of his pursuers. I at once made him a sporting
offer of twenty dollars if he would give me an exhibition of it, but he
informed me that it could only be done when he was really in danger,
and not for " swagger." The same man, moreover, claimed to possess

in child-birth being called "langsuir," and credited with all the attributes which
elsewhere belong to the Pontianak. Cf. Col. J. Low on Siamese customs in
J. A. I., vol. i., p. 361, which I had not seen when I wrote to the above effect in
Malay Magic, pp. 318 and 327. There is no doubt that the two are often
confused, but the belief in the langsuir, as distinguished from the Pontianak, is
certainly the usual explanation in the Peninsula. [Cf. Kruijt in Hed. .iVerf. Zend.,
xzxix., p. 17, and xlii., p. 433; also Riedel, 57, 58, 81, 184, 239, 267 (and in
several other passages), though in none of these is the langsuir once mentioned.

the power of clairvoyance, but failed in an easy test which he himself
proposed.
The first class of spiritualistic ceremonies, which happens to be the
one to which I specially wish to direct your attention to-night, consists
of a simple form of automatism, as represented by the movements of
inert objects. No form of table-turning is of course practised by the
Malays, who pass their lives for the most part in scattered communities,
either in the jungle or at sea, and who do not therefore make any
appreciable use of such luxuries as tables and chairs. Nevertheless a
fairly close parallel to our own table-turning exhibitions may be found
in the dance-ritual of inanimate objects which the Malay magicians
exhibit, though we do not as yet possess any clue as to the real purpose
of such performances.
A second class of automatisms, allied in form to these dances,
includes a large number of ways of divining by means of the
apparently intelligent movements of inanimate objects in contact with
the magician.
A third class, which requires to be distinguished to some extent
from automatic phenomena, consists mainly of ceremonies by which
certain demons, animals, or even inert objects are made to act upon
persons at a distance. This kind of ceremony corresponds to what is
usually known as a " sending."
The fourth and last class of ceremonies to which I shall refer includes
such rites as are intended to induce possession either for divinatory
purposes or for that of exorcism. These four classes will now be taken
in the order in which I have mentioned them.
I. In the first class of motor automatisms I place those ceremonies of
which the purpose does not lie on the surface, and can only be inferred
by the European observer.
The Palm-blossom Dance is a very curious exhibition, which I once
saw performed in the Langat district of Selangor. Two freshly-
gathered sprays of areca-blossom, each about four feet in length, were
deposited upon a new mat near a tray containing a censer and three
special kinds of sacrificial rice. No particular season was specified.
The magician ('• Che Ganti " by name) commenced the performance by
playing a prelude on his violin, and a few minutes later Che Ganti's
wife (an aged Selangor woman) took some of the sacrificial rice in her
hand and began to chaunt a weird sort of invocation, addressed to the
seven sister spirits, probably the souls of the palm. She was almost
immediately joined in the chaunt by a younger woman. The invoca
tion consists of four separate sets of seven stanzas, each stanza con
XLV.] Malay Spiritualism. 293
taining four short lines, which rhyme alternately. The first set begins
as follows :
" Thus I brace up, I brace up the palm-blossom,
And summon the elder sister to descend by herself.
Thus I brace up, I brace up the palm-blossom,
And summon the second sister to descend with the first."
The same words are repeated mutatis mutandis until all seven sisters
have been summoned to descend, the witch then covers the two sprays
of palm-blossom with a Malay plaid skirt or wrapper and five cubits of
white cloth, folded double and fumigated. The chaunt now changes
abruptly into the second set of seven stanzas :
" Borrow a hammer, borrow an anvil to forge the neckbones
of this- our sting-ray (i.e. the sheaf of blossom).
Borrow an orchard, borrow a courtyard,
To bring down upon earth the fairy sisters. "
Six stanzas follow, in which the names of six other parts of the
sting-ray, i.e. the head, wings, tail, gills, etc., are successively substi
tuted. At this point rice is thrown over one of the two sprays, its
sheath is opened, and the contents fumigated. Then the old woman
takes the newly-fumigated spray between her hands, holding it upright
at the base with her hands just resting on the ground, and the third
set of stanzas commences with the words :
" Dig up, O dig up the wild ginger-plant,
Dig till you get a finger's breadth or two of it.
Seek for, 0 seek for a magnificent domain
Into which to bring down the fairy sisters."
The remaining six stanzas of this set are similar to the first, with
variations appropriate to each one of the six remaining spirits. During
the chaunting of this third set, the erect spray of Palm-blossom, held
between the witch's bands, commenced swaying, at first almost imper
ceptibly, to the tune of the music, its motion becoming more and more
accentuated as the chaunt proceeded.
The last set of stanzas proceeded with the words :
" Bear on high the betel-rack, bear on high the betel-dish,
Bear them on high in the midst of the pleasure garden.
Come hither, my love, come hither, my life,
Come hither and seat yourself in the courtyard centre. "
The last six stanzas vary only in the invitations addressed to the
spirits, which are requested to ascend the house-ladder and wash their
feet, to take their seat upon the mats that are spread for them, and to
enjoy to the full the good things (e.g. betel-leaf, etc.) which their
u
294 Walter Skeat. [PART
hosts have provided for their refreshment. The invitation concludes
with an appeal to the spirits not to be too rough, but to be mild and
gentle, and as its wailing notes die away, it is believed that the seven
spirits descend and " perch " like birds ulxm the palm-blossom. At
this point the fiddle stopped and tambourines were substituted, the
spray of blossom forthwith proceeding to jump about on its base, as
if it were indeed possessed, until it eventually dashed itself violently
down upon the mat-covered floor of the dwelling.i
After one or two repetitions of this performance, with Che Ganti's
wife as the medium, other persons present (myself amongst them) were
invited to try their luck with it, and did so with varying success, which
depended, I was told, upon the impressionability of their souls, as the
palm-blossom spray would not dance for any one whose soul was not
impressionable. I myself must unfortunately have been one of these
people, as I never experienced the slightest tremor, and the palm-
blossom remained motionless until I got tired of waiting, and moved it
myself, when my doing so was of course hailed as the manifest work of
the spirit.
When the first blossom-sheaf had been destroyed by the rough treat
ment which it had to undergo (as each time at the conclusion of the
dance it was dashed upon the ground), the second was duly fumigated
and introduced to the company, and finally the performance was
brought to a close by chaunting a set of stanzas in which the spirits
arc requested to return to their own place. These latter commenced
as follows :
" I slip the palm-blossom, I slip it,
I slip it into the white bowl,
Escort the fairies, escort them,
Escort them unto the white heaven."
The remaining stanzas are precisely similar, with the exception of the
colours assigned to the bowl and the heavens, which are described
successively as black, green, blue, red, purple, and yellow. The two
sheaves were then carried out of the house and deposited on the
ground underneath a banana-tree. I was told that if this closing part
of the performance were not carried out with scrupulous care the
spirits would not leave the house, and its inmates would be strange in
their head for days, even if, indeed, none of them went mad.
The Dancing Fish-trap is a spiritualistic performance in which a fish-
i If I remember rightly Che Ganti's wife retained her hold of the spray until
it had dashed itself upon the ground two or three times, when she dropped it
and let it lie.
XLV.] Malay Spiritualism. 295
trap (lukah) is employed instead of the spray of palm-blossom, and a
different invocation is used. The fish-trap, moreover, is dressed up
much in the same way as one of our own "scare-crows," so as to
present a rude sort of resemblance to the human figure. Its " dress "
consists of a woman's jacket and plaid skirt (sarong), both of which
should (if possible) have been worn previously. A stick is then run
through the upper part of the trap to take the arms of the jacket and
a cocoanut-shell (preferably a sterile one) is clapped on the top to serve
as the fish-trap's head. The trap, when fully dressed, is held a few
inches above the ground by two or three people, each of whom applies
both his hands to the bottom of the Fish-trap, in a manner similar to
that employed in our own table-turning performances, and the invoca
tion is forthwith chaunted in the same manner and to the same accom
paniment as that used in the palm-blossom performance. At the close
of the invocation the magician whispers, so to speak, into the fish-trap's
ear, bidding it not to disgrace him, but rise up and dance; and
presently the fish-trap begins to rock to and fro, and to leap about
in a manner which, of course, proves it to be possessed by the
spirits.
Of the Dancing-Spoon of the Malays we are told in Primitive Culture,
ii., 152: "Mr. Darwin saw two Malay women on Keeling Island, who
held a wooden spoon, dressed in clothes like a doll ; this spoon had
been carried to the grave of a dead man, and becoming inspired at full
moon, in fact lunatic, it danced about convulsively, like a table or a
hat at a modern spirit seance." This is of course an automatism, not
a case of movement without contact.
II. In the next class I place those motor automatisms in which a
definite purpose, easily discernible by the uninitiated, is consciously
pursued. In this case also the objects are put in motion by the
unconscious muscular action of those in contact with them.
The Divining Lemon.—For divinatory purposes the Penang Malay
takes a " rough-coated " lemon, a hen's egg, a wax taper, four bananas,
four cigarettes, four rolled-up quids of betel-leaf, several handfuls of
sacrificial rice, one of the prickles of a thorn-back mudfish, a needle
with a torn eye (selected from a packet containing a score of needles,
out of which, however it must be the only one so damaged), and a
couple of small birches made of the leaf-ribs of palms—one with seven
twigs and the other with twelve. From among the foregoing articles,
with the exception of the lemon, the fish-prickle, and the needle, two
equal portions are made up, one portion, together with the birch of
296 Walter Skeat. [PART
seven twigs, being deposited under a tree outside the house. When
deposited, the egg must be cracked, and the cigarettes and the taper
be lighted. The taper is then taken up between the outspread fingers
of the joined hands, and " waved " slowly towards the right, centre,
and left. It is then deposited on the ground, and the taper presently
commences to burn blue, this being regarded as an "acknowledgment"
on the part of the spirit. The fish-prickle and the needle are now thrust
horizontally through the lower part of the lemon, at right angles to each
other, and left so that their four ends arc slightly projecting. A
silken cord of seven different-coloured strands is then slipped round
these ends, and serves as a means of suspending the lemon over the
brazier of incense, the upper end of the cord being held in the left hand
and the birch in the right. Everything being prepared, the magician,
after the customary scattering of rice and fumigation of the birch and
the lemon, recites the appropriate charm, and presently commences to
put questions to the lemon, which the spirit is now supposed to have
entered, rebuking and threatening it with the birch whenever it fails
to answer directly and to the point. The spirit's conversational
powers were, however, extremely limited, being confined to two signs
expressing "Yes" and "No." The affirmative was indicated by a
pendulum-like swing of the lemon, which rocked to and fro with more
or less vehemence according to the emphasis with which the reply was
supposed to be delivered. The negative, on the other hand, was
indicated by a complete cessation of motion on the part of the lemou.
When the lemon is required to discover the name of a thief, the names
of all those who are at all likely to have committed the theft are
written on scraps of paper and arranged in a circle round the brazier,
when the lemon will at once swing in the direction of the name of the
guilty party. The most propitious night for the performance of this
ceremony is believed to be a Tuesday.
The Cup and King Ordeal.—Another and perhaps a commoner form
of the foregoing ordeal is described by Maxwell, as follows : " Suppos
ing that a theft has taken place in a house, all the inmates are
assembled, and their names are written on the edge of a white cup, on
which some sentences of the Koran are also inscribed. A ring is then
suspended by a maiden's hair and held right over the middle of the
cup. It is then swung round gently, and the name which it first
strikes is the name of the thief."
In a slightly different form of the divination, the instrument is a
bowl, which is filled with water and covered over with a white cloth,
on which the scraps of paper with the names arc successively deposited.
XLV.] Malay Spiritualism. 297
The bowl is supported by two men on their knuckles, and a passage
from the Koran is read. When the scrap of paper containing the
name of the thief is laid on the cloth covering, the bowl twists itself
off the men's knuckles, and falls to the ground with a crash.
The Sieve Ordeal.—In some cases a sieve (nuiru) is similarly used.
Mystic sentences are written upon it with turmeric, and when all the
household is assembled a man grasps the sieve by the edge and holds
it out horizontally. Presently it is seen to commence oscillating up
and down, and pulls away from the man who is holding it, the latter
following its lead until it reaches and touches the thief.
The Divining-rod.—The last object of this class is the Malay divining-
ro<i, which is similarly gifted with the power of making supernatural
movements. This is a rod or birch of rotan sega (the best marketable
variety of cane), which may consist either of a single stem, or of any
odd number of stems up to nine. The handle of the rod or rods is
bound with a hank of " Javanese " yarn, which may or may not be
stained yellow. The sorcerer who wishes to use it grasps the butt-end
of the rod in his right fist, and after burning incense and scattering
sacrificial rice, repeats the appropriate charm, which commences with
a summons to the spirit to descend from the mountains and enter into
his embodiment. If the invocation is properly performed, the spirit
descends, and entering the sorcerer's head by way of the fontanel,
proceeds down his arm and into the rod itself. The result is that the
tip of the rod commences to rotate with rapidly increasing velocity,
until the sorcerer loses consciousness, in which case the rod will point
in the direction of any sort of lost or hidden treasure, which it may be
the object of the operators to discover. Even underground water
could, I was assured, be thus discovered.
III. We now come to the third class—that of demons, animals,
and even inert objects, which are made to act on persons at a distance
—a class which as I have already said includes sendings of every
description.i
Sendingx.—One form of sending is described as follows : '• When
one individual has animosity against another, he constructs a dagger
upon magic principles, and recites a prayer over it. Then, if his
adversary lives at a distance, the sorcerer, seizing the dagger by the

are called not sendingt but pointing», and I am not at all sure how far this view
applies.
298 Walter Skeat. [PART
handle, stabs with the point in the direction of his enemy, whereupon
the latter immediately falls sick. Blood gathers on the point of the
dagger, and this the man sucksi exclaiming: 'Now I am satisfied,'
whilst his adversary becomes speechless and expires."
Another form of Tujv, in which the bow appears to have been
employed as the instrument, was related to me by a Malay magician
as follows : If you wish to abduct another person's soul, you must go
out of the house either at daybreak or " when the newly-risen moon
looks red," and standing with the big toe of the right foot resting upon
the big toe of the left, make a trumpet by putting your right hand
before your mouth, and recite through it the charm, which runs as
follows :
"Om, I loose my shaft, I loose it, and the moon clouds over,
I loose it and the sun is extinguished,
I loose it and the stars burn dim.
Yet I shoot not at sun, moon, or stars,
But at the heart-strings of a child of the human race, so-and-so.
Cluck, cluck ! soul of so-and-so.
Come and walk with me,
Come and sit with me,
Come and sleep, and share my pillow."
The text of this charm would, I think, be conclusive proof, even if
there were no other, that the form of magic called arrow-sending, or
rather arrow-pointing, was formerly in vogue among Malay magicians.
The next three sendings are taken from an old but valuable
authority on the Peninsula named Begbie. One form of sending it is
called the Tuju Jantong, or the " heart-sending " ; jantong being the
Malay name both for the human heart and also for the cordiform top
of the newly-opened bunch of bananas. The person who employs this
form of witchcraft has to search for one of these cordiform tops and
perform a magic rite under it. He next has to tie the banana-top, and
having recited a prayer over it, burns the point which communicates
with the heart of his adversary, inflicting excruciating agony. When
he is tired of tormenting him he cuts the jantong, and the man's heart
simultaneously drops from its proper situation, blood issuing from the
mouth of the expiring sufferer.
In the remaining instances, the sendings apparently consisted of
insects.2 The Tuju Jindang is a kind of sending in which the sorcerer

XLV.] Malay Spiritualism. 299
employs an evil spirit in form of a caterpillar, which is carefully reared
in a new vessel and fed upon roasted padi. It partakes of the appear
ance of the silkworm. Its keeper directs it to attack the enemy,
saying : " Go and devour the heart and entrails of so-and-so," or words
to that effect, whereupon it departs and flies against the ill-fated
individual, entering generally either at the back of the hand or between
the shoulders. At the moment of contact a sensation is produced as if
a bird had flown against one's body, but it is invisible, and the only
sign of its presence is the livid hue of the spot where it has entered.
On entering, it forthwith performs its mission, inflicting intolerable
torment. The body gradually becomes blue, and the victim expires.
One of the spirits most dreaded by the Malays is the Polong, whose
shape is described as resembling nothing in the animal world, but
whose head is formed very much like the handle of a kris ; the eyes
being situated at either end of the cross-guard, and the upper part
of the blade representing the neck, from the extremity of which branch
out two spinous leg-like processes, running nearly parallel with its
spiral filiform body, widening out at the insertion, and gradually
approximating at the extremities ; at least such is the form of the
Polong which a Malay physician and dealer in the black art will
rudely sketch if requested to do so. It is difficult to believe, although
we are so assured, that this demon with whose figure the Malays
are so well acquainted, is nevertheless always invisible. It is death by
the Malayan code to keep one, but it is nevertheless asserted that
several females are in the habit of doing so, as the possession of a
Polong imparts exquisite beauty to its owner, even though she be
naturally ugly. The men seldom keep one of these spirits unless
they have some revenge to gratify, though occasionally they keep them
for hire by others. The Polong is kept in a small earthen bottle, whose
neck is sufficiently wide to permit the introduction of a finger. As it
feeds upon human blood, its keeper cuts his finger once or twice a week,
either on Friday or Monday night, and inserts it in the bottle for the
Polong to suck. Should this be neglected the demon issues from his
confinement and sucks the whole body until it becomes black and blue.
Directly any one is attacked by a Polong, he either screams out, and
falls down in a swoon, or becomes deathlike and speechless. Some
times possession is shown by incoherent raving, and in other cases by
acts of violence on the bystanders. Occasionally, even death itself
ensues. The Polong is under strict management, being obliged to
inflict the punishment in that kind and. degree which his master
directs. The Malays say that this form of possession (like that of
300 . Walter Skeat. [PART
werwolfismi) ia infectious, at least in some cases, as people who have
been so incautious as to ask the sufferer the simple question, " What
is the matter 1 Have you got a Polong 1 " are instantly affected in a
similar manner. Mr. Thompson (of Singapore) saw a man who posi
tively assured him that he had seen no less than twenty individuals
thus seized at the same time.
The soothsayer or physician is called in to the patient in order to
exorcise the spirit. He draws a representation of it in a white basin,
and pouring water on to it, desires the patient to drink the same. He
then holds the ends of the possessed person's thumbs, in order to
prevent the escape of the Polong (that being the door by which it makes
its exits and entrances), and questions it as to its motives for tormenting
the individual. Having received its replies through the mouth of the
possessed, he proceeds to search all over the body for the lurking place
of the spirit, which, notwithstanding its invisibility, is supposed to be
perfectly tangible, and to be lodged between the skin and the flesh.'-*
As soon as the magician has discovered the spot in which the Polong
is concealed, he exacts an oath of it to the effect that its previous
replies were true, and that it will never re-enter the body of the
person from whom it is about to be expelled. The sorcerer sometimes,
indeed, exerts so great a power over the Polong, as to compel it to enter
into and destroy its own master.
According to Malay accounts, the proper way to secure a Polong is
to deposit the blood of a murdered man in a small bottle or flask, and
recite sundry conjurations over it for a period of seven or fourteen days,
when a noise will be heard in the bottle resembling the chirping of
young birds. The operator then cuts his finger and inserts it into the
bottle, when the Polong sucks it. This "is repeated daily, and the
person who thus supports the Polong is called its father, if a man, or its
mother, if she happens to be a woman.3
The Polong is, I was assured, invariably preceded by its pet or
plaything, the Pelesil,* which appears to be usually identified with a
species of house-cricket, of which I was once shown a specimen by a
Malay in a small glass bottle or phial. Whenever the Polong is
commissioned by its adopted parents to attack a new victim, it sends
i [Cf. Tijfah-ift, xli., 458. N.W.T.]
1 [Something analogous appears to be the Japanese belief in possession by foxes,
which enter the body under the finger-nails. N.W.T.]
a Another Malay superstition is that the blood of murdered men turns into
fireflies ; cf. Malay Magic, 329.
4 [Cf. Journal Indian Archi^lago, 307: J. A. I., xxiv., 288. N.W.T.]
XLV.] Malay Spiritualism. 301
the Pelesit on 'before' it, 'and as soon as the latter, flying along in a
headlong fashion, usually tail foremost, enters .its victim's body and
begins to chirrup, the Polmg follows.
The Pelesit appears to be occasionally kept either as a substitute
for, or as actually identical with, the Polong, and I was told that it was,
like the Pobng, occasionally caught and kept in a bottle, and fed
either with parched rice or with rice stained yellow with turmeric, or
with blood drawn from the tip of the fourth finger, and that when its
owner desired to get rid of it, it was buried in the ground. One of
the most widely recognised ways of securing a Pelesit, which is regarded
in some parts of the Peninsula as a valuable species of property,
consists in exhuming the body of a child and carrying it at full moon to
an ant-hill, where it is reanimated and presently lolls out its tongue ;
when this happens the tongue must be bitten oft' and buried in a place
where three roads meet, when it will eventually develop into a Pelesit.i
The Polong is also sometimes identified or confused with a familiar
spirit called Bajang in Kedah, which appears, .however, to .have
originally been regarded as an entirely distinct conception, since its
usual embodiment is stated to have been a polecat or rather civet cat.
We have, then, in the list of Malay familiar spirits, the Polong (or
Bajang) and its plaything or messenger the Pelesit, the latter of which
occasionally appears to be actually regarded in some cases as the Polong's
embodiment, although it is more usually considered as distinct from the
Polong. During the Cambridge Expedition of 1899 we came more than
once on the track of these peculiar demons. At a village near
Trengganu I succeeded, by some strategy, in obtaining a snapshot of a
woman who kept a familiar spirit, but most probably she guessed that
something was up, for next morning my Malay friend who had helped
to arrange the matter came and told me she had just been to see him,
and had complained that she had dreamed that a great white
magician from over the sea had stolen away her soul. I sent her a
present of a little gold dust which I had recently purchased, but even
then she was only pacified with difficulty, as she complained I had not
sent her quite enough of it.
It is interesting to note the symptoms displayed by the supposed
victims of the demons I have just been describing. In various Malay
accounts we are told that a person possessed by a Polong, whether a
virgin or a married woman, either falls into a death-like swoon, or cries
out and loses consciousness of what he (or she) is doing, and tears and

Bnr. Eth., 1881-2, p. Ill ff. N.W.T.]

throws off his or her clothing, biting and striking bystanders, and blind
and deaf to everything. A certain sign that one of these fits is coming
on is for the sick person to rave about .cats. When the Polon-g has been
exorcised, the sick person at once recovers consciousness, but is left
weak and feeble ; but if the means adopted for exorcising it are un
successful, the person who is attacked yells and shrieks in anger, and
after a day or two dies. After death blood comes bubbling forth from
the mouth, and the whole body is blue with bruises.
At a place on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula I came across a
different belief, viz., that in a particular species of vampire. At Patani,
one of the members of the expedition (Mr. Gwynne-Vaughan) informed
me that he was walking down the main street of the town when he was
stopped and asked if he wished to see some skulls. He had the pre
sence of mind to reply in the affirmative, and was taken outside the
town and there shown two skulls which had been feeding, it was
alleged, upon the soul of a Malay woman. I myself then went to see
them, and bought the two skulls for a couple of dollars, and brought
them home.
Those who are familiar with T. Lockwood Kipling's fine work on
Man and Beast in India will doubtless remember the beautiful specimens
which he gives of the caligraphic pictures of which oriental penmen are
BO fond. Pictures of this kind are occasionally employed by Malay
magicians for various objects, and form one of the methods adopted for
guarding a house against the entry of the familiar spirits of which I
have been speaking They consist, as in India, of the names of God
and of various prophets, and prayers cleverly woven into a design,
which is believed to furnish a complete protection against the spirits
referred to.
IV. Of the ceremonies of the fourth class, viz. Possession and Devil-
dancing, I have seen, perhaps, altogether about half a dozen perform
ances, though I need scarcely remark that it is a most difficult task
for a European to obtain permission to attend such ceremonies at all,
and it can only be done by possessing a strong friend (so to speak)
at court.
At these performances the magician and a large number of his friends
and relations being assembled in the sick man's house, the magician
seats himself on the ground facing an attendant who chaunts the invo
cation, accompanying himself upon the Malay three-stringed viol.
After much burning of benzoin and scattering of sacrificial rice the
spirit descends, entering the magician's body through the fontancl.
The magician is at once seized with convulsive twitchings which seem
XLV.] Malay Spiritualism. 303
to spread all over his body, and these are accompanied by a rapid
rotatory motion of the head, which he makes revolve from right to left
at a tremendous pace,i shaking at the same time his shoulders and
thighs, and getting more and more violent until the whole body is
quaking like a jelly, thus producing an almost painfully vivid imitation
of an epileptic fit. Soon, however, he falls down in a state of what is
doubtless real exhaustion, and after an interval rises again and com
mences to dance. The entire process is repeated several times ; and a
quiet interval then follows, during which the magician, sitting on the
ground, replies in a high, squeaky, unnatural voice to any questions
that may be put to him, not merely as regards the welfare of his
patient, but even as regards private and personal matters, which are of
interest only to the patient's friends and relations. In the course of
this catechism the magician expounds the cause and nature of the sick
man's illness, as well as the remedies which should be adopted for his
recovery.
Among the oracles thus delivered at a performance attended by Mr.
F. F. Laidlaw and myself in Kelantan, there was one which is perhaps
well worth recording. We had arranged next day to attend a Malay
bull-fight, to which we had been invited by His Highness the Raja
Muda. These bull-fights are not fought on the unequal lines of the
spectacles called by that name in civilised Europe, but consist of a fight
on equal terms between two powerful and carefully trained bulls, which
seldom do each other or any one else much injury, and which as exhibi
tions of strength are exciting to watch. During the catechising of the
magician to which I have alluded, he was asked to give what I believe
is called the "straight tip" as to the probable winner of next day's
contest, and gave as his selection a bull named Awang Eanggong. On
the following afternoon Mr. Laidlaw and I were sitting on the dais

His Highness asked me which bull I thought looked most likely to win.
Remembering the sorcerer's tip, I replied " Awang Eanggong," though
I did not know one bull from the other, and in the result " Awang
Kanggong " certainly won hands down, breaking his opponent's horn in
a few rounds and driving him off the field in most ignominious fashion.
The sorcerer's reputation as a good " judge of cattle " naturally went
up, though I must confess that it would take a great deal more proof
than was actually forthcoming to make me believe that there could
have been anything supernormal about the sorcerer's tip. The sorcerer
appeared to remember what he had said when we talked with him

THE POLTERGEIST, HISTORICALLY CONSIDERED.
BY ANDREW LANG.
To the Proceedings S.P.R. (Part xxx. 1897, Vol. xn. pp. 45-115) Mr.
Podmore contributed an article on "Poltergeists." After analysing
eleven then recent cases, he found common trickery detected in four,
and confessed in three instances, and he inferred that trickery was the
" true and sufficient explanation," probably in the whole set. In much
the most curious example (1) that of Worksop, in 1883, the witnesses
were " imperfectly educated, and did not give their testimony till some
weeks after the event." In a little discussion with Mr. Podmore, I
pointed out that some witnesses, including a policeman of sceptical
character, gave evidence at the time of the events, and I published that
testimony extracted from the local newspaper of the date.i The interval
of some weeks before the persons were re-examined had produced no
additional marvels. I am rather inclined to doubt, as will later be
shown, whether memory, after a lapse of time, is always so mythopoeic,
so apt to exaggerate, as Mr. Podmore believes : and we know that,
among the educated, memory is often inclined to minimize extraordinary
occurrences. A case in point is that of Lord Fortescue, who, as a very
old man, about 1850, denied that he had heard of the wicked Lord
Lyttelton's ghost story, though he was in the house when Lord
Lyttelton died. Yet Lady Mary Coke, in her journal (privately
printed by the Earl of Home) for the date, tells the tale on the
authority of Lord (then Mr.) Fortescue. Lord Chesterfield said that,
if a man indubitably rose from the dead, in three days the Arch
bishop of Canterbury would disbelieve it. Probably most of us
know that, if anything very much out of the usual has come into
our experience, we gradually distrust our own impressions, and
reason the matter away. But the opposite process is doubtless the
more common, especially among the imaginative. By dint of excluding

evidence to the occurrence of curious phenomena in the alleged
absence of a person later detected in fraud ; and by insisting on trickery
as a vera causa, which it is, and by allowing more than I can easily do
for " collective hallucinations " (of which Sir Oliver Lodge is sceptical),
among the observers, Mr. Podmore succeeded in holding that the eleven
cases might be normally explained. To myself the uniformity of hallu
cination, in many places and ages, as to the peculiar and non-natural
flight of objects, appeared a thing difficult of belief. Therefore, while
admitting the force of the case for trickery in all such instances,—our
first, most natural, and most probable explanation,—I do not feel
absolutely convinced that it is the only explanation. But I have no
other theory to propound, and only wish to keep a door open for some
other undiscovered cause.
In March and June, 1899, Mr. Podmore returned to the theme, in
the Journal of the Society. (Vol. IX. p. 37 and p. 91). i
Mr. Alfred Kussel Wallace had suggested the examination of several
historical cases of unexplained disturbances, historically recorded.
These can never be satisfactorily analysed. We cannot cross-examine
witnesses : we cannot even examine the scenes of the events, in many
cases. Moreover few of Mr. Wallace's instances were such as I should
have selected. He omitted the case of Mrs. Kickett's house,—Hinton,
near Arlesford,—attested by that lady, and observed by Lord St. Vincent.
The house was pulled down, and it would be unfair to mention some
modern facts which may, perhaps, be germane to the matter. Mr.
Wallace also omitted the Willington Mill case, to which, therefore, Air.
Podmore did not refer. The Tedworth, Cideville (1851), and Epworth
cases remain, and, if only as folk-lore and history, are deserving of
some comments. An early, sceptical, and acute psychical researcher,
the Kev. Joseph Glanvil, F.K.S., wrote on the Tedworth case, which
he had investigated. We must regret that Mr. Glanvil was so un
methodical that his observations are of slight value. I quote Mr.
Podmore's criticisms of the Tedworth affair. (Journal S.P.R Vol. ix.
p. 39.)
The Drummer of Tedworth, as told by Glanvil. The disturbances
began "about the middle of April," 1661 (Glanvil only gives two exact
dates in the whole narrative), and continued for about two years.
Glauvil's account of it, as we learn from the preface to the fourth (posthu
mous) edition of Sadducumus Triumphatus, was first published in 1666.
i Mr. Podmore'a criticisms have since been reprinted, with slight modifications,
in his Modern Sjnritualism : A History and a Criticism, Vol. I. pp. 25-43
(Methuen&Co.).
XLV.] The Poltergeist, Historically Considered. 307
Glanvil himself paid one visit to the house "about this time "—the last date
given, on the previous page, being January 10th, 1662. Glauvil's account of
all he saw and heard is, in brief, as follows :—On hearing from a maid
servant that " it was come," he, with Mr. Mompesson and another, went up to
a bedroom ; "there were two little modest Girls in the Bed, between seven
and eleven Years old, as I guest." Glanvil heard a scratching in the bed " as
loud as one with long Nails could make upon a Bolster." This lasted for half-
an-honr and more, and Glanvil could not discover the cause ; it was succeeded
by a panting, like a dog, accompanied by movements in the bedding ; also
the windows shook ; also Glanvil saw a movement in a " Linnen Bag " that
hung against another bed, but was not apparently sufficiently sure of the
accuracy of his observation to mention this incident in the first (1668)
edition. Further, Glanvil was aroused by an untimely knocking next
morning ; and his horse fell ill on the way home, and died 2 or 3 days later.
This is the only detailed account which we have at first hand ; it is written
5 or 6 years after the events, and apparently not from full notes, as
Glanvil is unable to give the exact dates.
The rest of the account is founded on the real relation of Mr. Mompesson,
confirmed by other witnesses, " and partly from his own letters." There are
also two letters of Mompesson's, dated respectively 1672 and 1674. But he
gives no detailed confirmation of Glanvil's account ; indeed, when the second
letter was written he expressly says that he had lent Glanvil's book " for the
use of the Lord Hollis," the previous year, and did not know what the account
contained. But even if we assume that Glanvil had accurately put down 5
or 6 years later all that he had heard from Mompesson, it does not amount
to much ; for it does not appear that Mompesson himself witnessed any of
the more marvellous incidents—the drops of blood, the chairs moving by
themselves, " the great Body with two red and glaring eyes," and all the rest
of it. These things were witnessed by neighbours, by men-servants, or by
aii undistributed " they." So that Glanvil's account of them may be third
hand or tenth hand.
Now the first known edition of Glanvil's Considerations about Witch
craft is of 1666. Most of the impression was burned in the Great Fire
of London, and I have not access to a copy of that date. I give below
GlanviPs dates from his edition of 1668.i

In this instance no attempt is made by Mr. Podmore to explain the
events by fraud : the evidence is merely disabled as late, and, perhaps,
"at third or tenth hand." Indeed the evidence is in a confused
way. The dates are all wrong. Glanvil places the occurrences be
tween April 1661 and January 1663. This is erroneous. The dates
ought to be March 1662—April 1663. Though it is not my earliest
document, I cite, from the Mercurius Pullicus of April 1663, the
following sworn deposition of Mr. Mompesson.

No. 1G. April 16(13.
The Information of Mr. John Mompeason of Tedworth in the County of
Wilts: taken this day 15th of April 1663, upon oath: against William
Drury :
Who saith that at the beginning of March last [1662] was Twelvemonth,
he being at Ludgurshal in this County, at the Bailiffs house, and hearing a
Drum beat, enquired what Drum it was. The Bailiff informed him that he
was a stranger going for Portsmouth, having a Pass under the hands and
seals of two of his Majeste's Justices of Peace for the County of Wilts for
his passing to Portsmouth, and to be allowed and relieved in his journey ;
and that he had been requiring money of them, and they were col lectiug
money for him.
He this Informant saith, that suspecting him to be a Cheat, he desired the
Officer of the Town to send for him, which accordingly he did, and examining
him how he dar'd go up and down in that way beating his Drum, and
requiring money ; he, this Informant, saith Drury answered I have good
Authority ; and produced a pretended Pass under the hands and seals as
aforesaid, Drury positively affirming it was their hands and seals. He this
Informant saith, that knowing it to be counterfeit, he charged him with it,
and was sending him before a Justice of Peace : and then Drury beggM, aiid
confess'd he made it : and upon his begging he let that pass. But he this
Informant further saith he took away his Drum, which Drury was very
unwilling to part with.
He this Infprmant saith, he left the Drum for some time after at
December, later end, 1662. Drumuungs less frequent, but " ginglings as ofmanfy "
begin. (As at Epworth, in 1717. A. L.)
January beginning, 1662 [1663]. Singing in the chimney and lights seen in the
house.
Saturday, Jan. 10, 1662 [1663]. Drum beat on outside of house. Next night

"About this time " Glanvil's curiosity took him to the house. He gives his
account of his visit.

Triumphatu», of 1681 and later.]

Ludgurshal ; and that immediately after he had sent for the Drum to his
house, a Drum began to beat in the night, Roundheads and Cuckolds yo dig,
go dig (which the said Drury did usually beat, and seldome any other note.)
This beating of a Drum increast more and more, from room to room : at last
he this Informant saith, he burnt the Drum that he had taken from Drury ;
and then the beating of a Drum, and some time knocking, several great noises,
scratching, troubling the Beds : sometimes the noise so violent, that it might be
heard a mile ; and continues to this day (April 15, 1663), and more than
formerly. And if they call to it, as several persons have, saying, Devil,
Knocker or Drummer, come tell us if the man from whom the Drum was
taken be the cause of this, give three knocks, and no more ; and immediately
three loud knocks were given, and no more. After that, another time,
Come tell us if the man from whom the Drum was taken be the cause of
all this, by giving five knocks, and away ; and presently five very loud
knocks were given, and away, and no more heard at that time.
Drury's Examination as to this confesseth his being at Ludgurthal about
the time named, and his beating Drum there ; his false Pass, and that Mr.
Mompesson took away from him his Drum ; but denies that he hath any way
practised witchcraft, or that he hath been any way the cause of that trouble.
For the Escape made by him, and the Charge given against him by Air.
Mompetaan of witchcraft, he was sent to the County-goal at Sarum, there to
remain till the next Assizes. It may be observed that this Drury was about
four or five months since committed to Glocester-goal for felony ; and Mr.
Mompesson being informed he had several times in the gaol exprest himself
pleased at the report of the troubles in his house, saying, although the Drum
be burnt the Devil is not dead: and that he had better let me and my Drum
alone : two or three days after the late Assizes holden there, resolved to go
down to Glocester, forty miles from his house, to inform himself what was
become of Drury.
The night before he took his journey, a Drum beat in his stable, where it
had not been heard to beat before : and the morrow morning his Gelding
being brought forth of the stable, was fain very lame ; but however, he went
for Glocester, and there was informed, as before related, that he (Drury)
was sent away for Virginia.
Mr. M»mpeston, being upon his return back from Glocester, in his way,
on Munday night last, lodged at a place called Droughton in this County,
within two miles of Alscut. (?) On Thursday morning he was informed that the
said Will. Drury came to his house at Mscut, (?) the Munday night, with a
Drum at his back, and had beat it that night. Upon which Mr. Mompesson
procured a warrant to search for, and apprehend him ; which the same day
was accordingly drne, and the said Drury sent to goal.
It i» supposed that this Drury, with the other prisoners, have made this
escape by murthering the Bargemen.
From this account it would appear that the quarrel between Mr.
Mompesson and Drury, the drummer, began in March, 1662. The

noises and disturbances commenced in April. Drury was imprisoned
on an independent charge of felony at Gloucester about December
1662 : was found guilty and sentenced to transportation ; escaped,
and began to annoy Mr. Mompesson, who next accused him of witch
craft on April 15, 1663, at Salisbury. The ground of action was
the alleged use by Drury, when in gaol at Gloucester, of expressions
connecting him with the unexplained disturbances. The Grand Jury
found a true bill, but Drury was acquitted on trial for lack of
evidence to connect him with the affair. Air. Mompesson, two or
three neighbouring gentlemen, and the parson of the parish, gave
evidence, at Salisbury, to the phenomena. Unluckily, we have only
Mr. Mompesson's deposition : I have failed to discover the full
records of the trial in MS. In the printed deposition, Mr. Mom
pesson does not say what he himself heard and saw ; he merely
complains of " knocking, great noises, scratching, troubling the beds,"
and so forth. There can be no moral doubt, perhaps, that Mr.
Mompesson and his witnesses attested their personal experiences of
these familiar phenomena. But their evidence is lost or inaccessible.
That Glanvil's tales about the disturbances, if not printed till 1666-
1668, were current as early as 1662, and were not invented or even
exaggerated between 1663 and 1666-1668, I can readily prove.
The earliest contemporary record known to me is a ballad i of the
year 1662, in which the disturbance at Tedworth began. This
extremely inartificial poem was hunted out by Miss Elsie Alleyne
at the Bodleian Library. It is earlier, if the printed date, 1662,
be correct, than the sworn deposition of Mr. Mompesson, of April 1 5,
1663. The ballad gives details which are not in Mr. Mompesson's
printed statement, but are chronicled by Glanvil at least as early
as 1 668 ; for example, the story of the bed staff which spontaneously
" went for " the clergyman while he was praying.

might suppose that the nervous shock to the "little modest girls"
under eleven, caused them hysterically to feign the disturbances witnessed
by Glanvil in their bedroom. Mr. Podmore disables Mr. Glanvil's
evidence. He was far from being a stupid man, and the children
were so very young that I am unwilling to credit them with trickery.
I think, too, that Glanvil published a tract on the affair as early as
1663. In June, 1663, Mr. Pepys tells us "there are books of it,
arid, they say, very true." I fancy that Glanvil was probably the
author of one of "these books of it," that he put his narrative later
into his Philosophical Considerations Touching Witches and Witchcraft,
and that the ballad poet simply rhymed after Glanvil's prose (quarto,
1666; folio, 1668). Till the "books" of 1662-1663 are discovered
I must leave the drummer with a few remarks.
I happen to know a modern parallel to Glanvil's alleged scratchings.
A gentleman, distinguished in law and known in politics, informs me
that, going one day upstairs in his house in Maida Vale, he heard a
violent scratching, as if of a highly excited tiger on the outside, as
he deemed, of the nursery door. Eunning up he found two of his
children (boys, one now grown up corroborated) and the nurse in
great alarm. This accident kept recurring ; there were no marks
or scratches on either side of the door. I was told this, as I
suggested that the nurse or the children had scratched the door
with a large comb. The owner of the house, being addressed by
his tenant, showed a nervous anxiety to evade the topic ; and my
acquaintance discovered no explanation. This was his only encounter
with anything so much out of the common run of human experience.
Let us, then, grant that the nurse laid a board of wood, procured for
that purpose, against the door, inside, and violently scratched it
with some instrument, " with intent to deceive," and from a hysterical
desire of notoriety, which she did not obtain, as nobody connected
her with the sounds. This explanation, in fact, did not occur to
the trained legal faculties of her employer.
As for the Mompesson children, the disturbances were worked by
them not only at night, but when put to bed "in fair day." On
Guy Fawkes' day, 1662, a board of wood kept going to and fro in
the day time, "seen by a whole roomful of people," say Glanvil.
Mr. Cragg, the clergyman, who (with two other gentlemen) gave
evidence at Drury's trial (April 15, 1663) prayed in the room, "and
then, in sight of the company, the chairs walked about of them
selves," so clever were these bad little girls in bed.i Mr. Mompesson
i So also in thu ballad of 1662.
XLV.] The Poltergeist, Historically Considered. 315
now sent all the children but the eldest girl away, and took that
impostor, aged ten, into his own bedroom, where the drumming
(the child being in bed) was as active as ever. She, I suppose, also
kept plucking the bed clothes off the bed of the footman (Anthony) ;
or the man said that this annoyance, so common in such cases,
occurred. One child succeeded in making three distinct sets of noises
in her bed, accompanied by wrigglings as of a living thing, in the
bolster.
The Rev. Joseph Glanvil, apparently about March 1663 (the date
1662 must be an error) then visited the house. "There were two
little modest girls in the bed" (naughty little minxes) "between
seven and eleven years as I guessed. I saw their hands out of the
clothes, and they could not contribute to the noise that was made
behind their heads." Mr. Glanvil little knew the artfulness of
little girls. "I searched under and behind the bed, turned up the
cloaths to the Bed-cords, grasped the Bolster, sounded the wall, and
made all the search possible." A friend aided Glanvil in these
studies. A kind of panting noise, apparently under the bed, "shook
the room and windows very considerably." This would be worked
by collusion, some one in the " cock loft " above would be thumping
on the floor ; according to our theory.
Glanvil had critics. He was told that he was in a fright and
hallucinated. "This is the Eternal Evasion," Glanvil replies. He
asserts his perfect coolness, and the certainty of his observations.
Sometimes the children were forced to leave their beds and sit up
all night, which, of course, was the very thing that little girls would
enjoy. Glanvil's report, apart from his own experience, was taken
from Mr. Mompesson's conversation and letters ; " he being neither
vain nor credulous, but a discreet, sagacious, and manly person."
In a letter of November 8, 1672, to Glanvil, Mr. Mompesson formally
denied that he had ever told the King, as was rumoured, that "a
cheat had been discovered about that affair" (1). To do so, said
he, would be to perjure himself. He stuck (August 8, 1674) to his
evidence, given at Salisbury, in April, 1663. "The shaking of the
Floor and strongest parts of the House in still and calm Nights,"
Mr. Mompesson especially insisted on, as the ballad of 1662 also
does. Perhaps no little girl could shake the strongest parts of the
house, a phenomenon which was frequent, according to Robert
Chambers, in the case of D. D. Home. I have cited Glanvil mainly
to show the harmony between his version, though late, and that of
the ballad of 1662. But, of course, the lateness of Glanvil's work,
316 Andrew Lang. [PART
and his inexplicable confusion of dates, do not increase our confidence
in his narrative.
The Tedworth case, of course, is not evidential. But I think that
my praiseworthy researches have made it fairly clear that absolutely
contemporary accounts did not vary much from those of Glanvil in
1666-1668 j that the 'deplorable ballad is probably versified from a lost
pamphlet of Glanvil's, or some other book almost identical ; that very
tedious and wearying disturbances prompted Mr. Mompesson's con
temporary deposition, and those of his friends ; and that very young
children could hardly have produced the disturbances, as described,
without detection. The phenomena, again, were of the regular
poltergeist or "spiritualistic" kind, and their true cause was never
discovered. This may, perhaps, be reckoned an advance historically
on the results of Mr. Podmore's investigation ; but he, by the nature
of Mr. Wallace's challenge, was perhaps limited to Glanvil's own
account. Otherwise he would have resorted to the proper Quelkn.
These do not wholly confirm his theory of unconscious exaggeration
after the interval of a few weeks or even years.
THE EPWORTH CASE.
As to the Wesley case at Epworth (December, 1716, April (?), 1717),
Mr. Podmore's criticism must be summarised. The evidence consists
of letters (January-April, 1717), between young Sam Wesley, then at
Westminster with Atterbury, and his mother, his father, and two of
his many sisters, at home. We have also an account written for the
inquiring Sam by old Mr. Wesley ; it seems to have been completed by
January 24, and certainly was finished by February 11, 1717. There
is also a brief diary of old Mr. Wesley's—December 21, January 1,
1716-1717. Next comes a set of narratives written in August-Septem
ber, 1726, at Epworth, for John Wesley (who had been at Charterhouse
in 1717). The writers or narrators in 1726 are Mrs. Wesley, Emily,
Sukey, Nancy, Molly, Keziah, the Rev. Mr. Hoole, the man servant,
and others. We need not look at a late narrative by John Wesley, a
magazine article.
Taking the papers of 1716-1717, with those of 1726, Mr. Podmore
decides :
(1) That in 1717, "witnesses narrate of their own personal experience
only comparatively tame and uninteresting episodes."
(2) "They (1717) allow their imaginations to embellish somewhat
the experience of other members of the household."
XLV.] The Poltergeist, Historically Considered. 317
(3) In 1726 these other members adopt the "imaginative embellish
ments " of 1 7 1 7 into their own first-hand accounts.
(4) The witnesses (thanks to what I may call mythopoeic memory),
make, in 1726, additions to or amplifications of their narratives of
1717.
Now (1) the personal experiences, say, of Mr. Wesley, recorded in
1717, are not tame, and are not uninteresting, I think, either com
paratively or positively. He was thrice pushed about by " an invisible
power." Again, this, the oddest of all the phenomena (if Mr. Wesley
was not drunk, and I never heard that he drank too much), is told by
himself of himself, and is not alluded to by any other witness. More
over, " ' it ' rattled and thundered, behind and before him, in rooms
locked and unlocked" (record of 1717).i
(2), (3) In 1717 Mr. Wesley and Emily told Sam, about Mrs. Wesley,
things which she did not tell Sam in 1717, herself, but did tell Jack in
1726. However, in the letters of Mrs. Wesley, Mr. Wesley, and Sam,
in 1717, it is thrice averred that, in 1717, she "forbore many
particulars," or did not tell " one third " of the circumstances.
Mr. Podmore omits this fact. In 1726, then, she merely did tell
a few of the things which, in 1717, others told, but she confessedly
" forbore." The story of the badger seen by Mrs. Wesley was told by
Emily, in 1717. In 1726, Mrs. Wesley says that Emily was present,
in 1717, when she saw this illusion, let us call it.
(4) Every circumstance "added" in 1717, by Mrs. Wesley, except a
reference to her nightgown and the examination of certain bottles, was
told in 1717 by Mr. Wesley, who was with her in an exploration of the
house and shared her experiences. There was not, in 1717, "one
sound diversely interpreted," as Mr. Podmore declares : there were,
Mr. Wesley says, (1717) two distinct sounds, of breaking glass and
jingling money. The fright of the mastiff was recorded by Mr. Wesley,
in 1717, as well as in 1726 by his wife.
Mr. Podmore has probably not observed this, nor noted that, in
1717, Mrs. Wesley confessedly did not record a third of the experiences.
The two sounds and the mastiff are of contemporary record.
Again, in 1726, Keziah (a child in 1717), did not make mythopoeic
additions to, or even remember her own experiences, recorded by
Emily in 1717 (as by Mr. Podmore's theory she ought to have done),
but could only recall a sound imitative of her father's knock.
Mr. Hoole's account, in 1726, is much less full and much less
i The Letters are in Southey's Life ofJohn Wesley.
318 Andrew Lang. [PABT
"sensational" than Mr. Wesley's description, in 1717, of their
common experiences. Mr. Hoole minimized.
Thus I conceive that Mrs. Wesley, Keziah, and Mr. Hoole, in 1726,
do not embroider upon the records of 1717.
As to the reports of the four sisters, in 1726, two had not written at
all in 1717. The whole family, at that date, were heartily sick of the
subject and of Sam's inquiries. Susan, in 1726, omitted some of the
strangest experiences which, in 1717, she had recorded ; and mentioned
others which, in 1717, she did not chronicle. Mr. Podmore, naturally,
notes Susan's "amplification" in 1726. About the omissions of Susan
in the same year, he, as naturally, says nothing. Emily, in 1726,
makes a considerable and, I suspect, mythic or misplaced addition to
her record of 1717, but she also makes many and most important
omissions. These are not remarked on by Mr. Podmore. Manifestly,
if he is to argue that, in nine years, there were amplifications, he
ought to notice, also, that the omissions are more numerous and
more important. This is so obvious that, if he chose, he might say,
"by 1726 several narrators had become ashamed of, and therefore
omitted, the absurd fables which excitement made them tell in 1717."
This sceptical argument is really stronger than that which Mr. Pod-
more advances. Perhaps his best plan would be to combine the two.
Where witnesses make additions, in 1726, they act under the influence
of the magmfying power of the memory. Where the same witnesses
make omissions, they do so because they are now ashamed of their ex
aggerations of 1717, to which, however, they also add, by mythopoeic
exaggeration. The double argument does not commend itself to me.
But Mr. Podmore must account for the late omissions, of which he says
not a word, as well as for the amplifications, on which he dwells with
emphasis. At least this is how it strikes me.
We next come to Hetty's case. She is suspicious, as the fraudulent
agent :
(1) Because the agency, she thought, had "had a particular spight
at her," and was noisiest in her neigbourhood. But the agency had
also, we are told, " a particular spight " at Mr. Wesley, going the
length of three personal assaults. If Hetty saw " something like a man
in a loose trailing dressing gown " (she is not said to have seen him),
three or four others in records of 1717 heard the sound like that of a
sweeping dressing gown. Hetty's case is not peculiar in this respect.
(2) Hetty had "the singlar habit of trembling in a sound sleep when
loud noises were going on all around her." So had the two other girls
who shared her bed. (Mr. Wesley, 1717 ; Mrs. Wesley, 1726.)
XLV.] The Poltergeist, Historically Considered. 319
(3) Hetty did not write an account in 1717, or none survives,
though Emily says that Hetty is writing. Nor are Molly, and Nancy
known to have written in 1717. Hetty's silence is not peculiar to her.
(4) Hetty gave no account to Jack, as the others did, at Epworth in
1726. Where was Hetty in 1726, and on what terms with Jack ?
As a matter of fact, in 1726 Hetty was not at Epworth at all, but
far away, and could not, like the others, be examined by Jack. For
reasons rather obscure, but connected with her recent marriage, Hetty
was in her father's disgrace ; he never forgave her, and, living with her
husband, a plumber of no culture, she was remote from the scene of
Jack's inquiries. The scientific sceptic ought to know the historical
facts of Hetty's case. So wretched and so repentant was this beautiful
and charming girl, and so kind to her was Jack, that she would
probably have confessed to him her early practical joke, if she had
been guilty.
Let me add that, if we are to find a trickster, the new maid-servant
attracts suspicion. The disturbances began with her ; she was
frightened by groans before any one of the family heard anything.
She is also the last recorded percipient of any phenomena (April, 1717).
Mrs. Wesley had a strict eye on her own girls and their lovers ; but
we scarcely ever hear where the new maid-servant was on any of the
many recorded occurrences of an unexplained kind. Mrs. Wesley
acquitted the maid ; but if, as I shall try to show, persons can be
frightened into a hysterical condition, and into fraudulent production
of odd occurrences, it would be easier to frighten a rustic servant girl
than a daughter of the rectory. i
Mr. Podmore himself, I daresay, will be pleased if I have dissipated
his suspicions of Hetty Wesley. I think I have shown, by the
evidence, that her case presented no peculiarities : that she was not the
only sister who did not write to Sam in 1717 ; not the only sister who
trembled in her sleep; and that, in the Long Vacation of 1726, Jack
could not examine her on the spot, as he did the rest of the family,
because she was far away. Then there is the servant maid to fall back
upon as the impostor—she and any waggish swains whom she may
have secreted in the long darkling and winding chamber in the
i May I add that Mr. Podmore has said nothing about the hints that the noises
were hallucinatory ? Mr. Wesley, like Lord St. Vincent in the Hinton case,
heard nothing at all till he was told about the noises. Later, he did not hear,
and some of the others did not hear, a " very loud " knock on his own bed, heard
by " most of the family." The Maws, who lived opposite, listened, but heard
nothing, when the noises were " in their full majesty." (Recorded in 1726.)

roof of the house. At Epworth a simple boyish mechanism for
producing knocks on the outer walls of a house is even now familiar.
You need no more than a nail, a button, a piece of string, and the
cover of a wall or bush. To be sure this trick does not explain a
tenth of the phenomena described.
It ought to be observed that, according to Emily Wesley, in 1717,
her father had preached against the local " cunning men " for several
Sundays before " old Jeffrey," the bogle, began his pranks. That fact
seems to me to be the key of the situation. At Cideville (1851) a
rural warlock, and two small boys whom he frightened, were certainly
the "agents" in the disturbances. In a strange Red Indian case, of
which I received reports (1899), the agent, a native girl of fourteen,
had received a severe nervous shock from natural causes before heavy
weights began to "tobogan about the floor" of the wigwam, accom
panied by the usual intelligent knocks and scratches. These, as I now
learn (1901), the Indians, at first sceptical, attributed to the agency of
a medicine man, lately deceased. In Miss Florence O'Neal's Devon
shire Idylls, a good country girl is alarmed by a witch, and heavy
furniture then becomes volatile. No fraud, however, was detected.
Miss O'Neal kindly informed me as to the circumstances. I give
another case, received from a Lincolnshire man, the Rev. Mr. Heanley.
THE RECTORY, WEYHILL, ANDOVER, HANTS,
October 20«A, 1901.
Dear Mr. Lang,
You aak me to furnish you with the particulars of a
" Wise woman " " sending noises," which came under my notice in the
Lincolnshire Marshland. I will do so to the best of my power, although it
will be a necessarily imperfect account, for I was then only just about to
matriculate at Oxford, aud I lost all interest in the case when it became
clear that the immediate agent in producing the disturbances was the
servant girl in the house affected. For it never occurred to me to look more
deeply into the matter, and ask the all important question as to what
external influences might have been brought to bear upon her to make her
act in the extraordinary fashion which she did. 1 simply thought it a case
of hysteria.
It was in the summer of 1867, the year after the cattle plague had raged
in the Marshes, when there was an extraordinary reversion amongst the
numerous small freeholders and little tenant farmers to the use of charms
and spells to safeguard their cows ; and " wise-men " and " wise-women "
reaped a harvest accordingly.
In my own parish of Croft Marsh there were two such reputed " wise
women," Mary X., the wife of a farm bailiff, and Mrs. K., wife of a small
tenant farmer, who kept one servant, a nervous, delicate girl. Mary X. had
XLV.] The Poltergeist, Historically Considered. 321
by far the greater reputation of the two, but Mrs. K. contrived to draw
away some of Mary's wonted customers.
One afternoon the servant, who had been sent on an errand, returned in a
terrible taking. Mary had met her upon the road, and after " lookin' solid "
at her for some time without speaking, had fiiially said, " Get thee whoam
and tell that old b of a missus of thine that them as I knaws on, does
more than them as she knaws on, and them as can, 'ull larn her \vp shakins
and talkins, and remblins 1 to mell wi' jobs as belongs to me. Get thee
whoam, and moind thou saay I sent thee."
The girl was half dazed with fright, but faithfully delivered her message,
and Mrs. K. flew into a tremendous rage, abusing the girl furiously for
venturing to repeat such "daffle," and daring old Mary to do her d dest.
But the girl repeatedly said she knew as sunnnat was comin' ; and sure
enough within a week disturbances began in the house, strange whisperings,
unexpected knocks, and finally moving of furniture. At first the manifesta
tions only took place at night, but in a few days they began in the daytime ;
and it was then that the servant was caught in the act, I think, of fixing
two boards under her bed to form a sort of clapper, and was dismissed on
the spot, when the disturbances promptly ceased, and did not recur again.
But so far as I can recollect the girl stuck stoutly to her assertion that she
had no knowledge of what she was doing, and professed herself as much
alarmed as any one else at the whole affair.
Here as in the Grimsby case (Oct., Nov. 1901) we have malum
minalum,—the witch's threat,—and damnum secutum, a set of Polter
geist phenomena. It looks almost like an affair of " suggestion : " how
far the trickster (in Mr. Heanley's case) was normally conscious of her
acts, we do not know. In Mr. Podmore's second case, at Wem
(Proceedings, Vol. xn. p. 67) the agent, Emma Davies, "cried out
that an old woman was at her,"—the regular old witchcraft symptom,
—and she may have been frightened, as in Mr. Heanley's instance.
WILLINGTON MILL.
The Willington case is closely analogous to that of Epworth, but is
nearer our time by a hundred and twenty years. (1835-1847.) The
best part of the evidence is found in MS. statements, drawn up
during the disturbances, but not in the shape of a regular diary, by
Mr. Joseph Procter, the occupant of the house (Journal S. P.E.
December, 1892, Vol. v., pp. 331-352). Mr. Procter was a Quaker,
an Anti-Slavery man, an "early tec-totaller " and a good example of
his community. His first statement is of January 28, 1835.
In December 1834, Mrs. Procter first heard of the troubles from the
nurse-maid. With her the experiences began, as at Epworth they
i To " remble " is to move or shift a thing. Cf. French rembler.
322 Andrew Lang. [PABT
began, with the maid-servant. The nurse-maid used to sit by the
cradle of one of the children in a room on the second floor. The
chamber above was unoccupied. The earliest phenomena were sounds
of some one walking heavily in the room above, so that the nursery
window rattled, as the windows always do in these cases. Before
many days elapsed " every member of the family " had shared the
experience. In January 1835 the first percipient, the nurse, left; but
the phenomena remained. Some visitors (in January) heard nothing :
" all, with one exception, have been disappointed." (January 28, 1835.)
The " haunted " room, on the third floor, was examined carefully :
nothing in the way of explanation was discovered. There were no
rats : the sounds " had no connection with the weather."
On February 18, 1835, Mr. Procter noted the disturbances since
January 28. On January 31, heavy "deadened" knocks sounded
close to his own bed. Omitting several stories, we find (Dec. 16, 1835)
the sound as of winding up a jack, at Epworth, here of a clock : heard
by Mrs Procter's sister and a companion.
The bed lifting (as in Nancy Wesley's case, reported in 1726) was
part of the experience of Mrs. Procter and nurse Pollard. Mrs. Procter
described it to her son, Edmund, "as if a man were underneath pushing
up the bed with his back" (Dickens describes a slight earthquake
shock in similar terms, substituting " a large beast " for a man, under
the bed.) Sounds of footsteps, knocks, and trailing garments were
.common at Willington as at Epworth. One of the little boys "was
found trembling and perspiring with fright," like three of the Epworth
girls. Mr. Procter does not recount many of his personal experiences,
which were mainly of sounds, especially an odious kind of " whistling
or whizzing," heavy knockings, and peculiar moans. The visual
hallucinations represented a monkey, " a funny cat," and one or two
human phantasms, not beheld by Mr. Procter. In 1847, after twelve
years of annoyance, the Procters left Willington : there was a tremen
dous <harivari the night before they departed. As at Tedworth, a
report was circulated that Mr. Procter had discovered the cause of the
phenomena to be a trick practised upon him. This, like Mr. Mompes-
son, he denied. (Tynemouth, January 7, 1858.) The circulation of
this false explanation is, itself, one of the recurrent phenomena, in
these cases. No mortal has ever yet discovered, what Sir Walter
Scott could not find, " Funny Joe's " confession of having caused the
Woodstock disturbances. But Funny Joe is always cited, as if he
were an authentic authority. His evidence is precisely on a par with
.the girl who talked Greek and Hebrew, that old favourite of the
XLV.] The Poltergeist, Historically Considered. 323
•authors of scientific manuals of psychology. For science is easily
satisfied, when the evidence suits the theory in vogue.
Here, speaking as an anthropological amateur, I would again remark
on the uniformity of the phenomena from the Eskimo (Rink) to my
Red Indian case, in Hudson Bay Company Territory, to D. D. Home,
or to the most ignorant little country girl, or to very early missionary
reports from newly conquered Peru, or to Mr. Dennys's Chinese cases,
or those of Catholic missionaries in Cochin China ; it is always the old
story of Epworth, Tedworth, Amherst, Rerrick, and so forth. The
thing is "Universally Human." Why? Is there a traditional trick; a
common hallucination (as Coleridge thought) or are we still to seek for a
theory? Mr. Podmore (1896-97) has the Arundel case. "A bewitched"
girl was producing " scratchings," which on a given occasion (Feb. 8,
1884) were, beyond all doubt, fraudulent, as was proved by Mr.
Hubbert, F.R.C.S. (Proceedings, Vol. xn., p. 67.) Earlier in the
evening, however, according to the girl's mother, a " perfectly honest
witness," the sounds occurred while she held the child's hands. The
mother tried another bed in another room. " She states that the first
bed heaved up (as at Epworth and Willington), and that, when
they went into the second room, the bed and everything in the
room shook." Had the girl " crammed " the Tedworth, Epworth,
and Willington cases/ with a crowd of others, British and foreign 1
Had the child been studying historic records, or have they become
orally familiar? Once the thing began, the child could scratch her
mattress when nobody was in the room, and she did. But about
the heaving up of the bed,—that she could not do, while in the
bed. Was the mother hallucinated in the traditional way, like
Robert Chambers, when with D. D. Home ?
" The chamber floor would rise and fall,
And never a board disjointed ! "
What we really desire is an answer to the question : How do
these stories come to be told 1 I am not too contented with the
answer, " Because young people play a few foolish tricks : the rest
is all exaggeration and hallucination." It is the extraordinary
uniformity in the reports, from every age, country, and class of
society, the uniformity in hallucination, that makes the mystery.
I may be allowed to quote, not as " evidential " but as illustrative
of this uniformity, a few cases from Monsieur de Mirville ; as his
book is not in the hands of everybody. I cite the second edition
(1854). This is not the tract in which de Mirville published the
324 Andrew Lang. [PART
depositions of witnesses in the Cideville case (1850-1851). In the
work of 1854, he argues from these depositions in the court of the Juge
de Paix at Yerville. In 1854 he collects other examples.
Into the case of Angelique Cottin, which began on January 15, 1846,
I cannot go, for lack of a complete dossier, or collection of documents.
On January 15, 1854, objects flew about in the girl's neighbourhood.
Next day, the neighbours had picked out some one as the witch
or wizard who threw the spell on her. The disturbances went on,
the curt was called in, was sceptical, then verified the facts, and sent
for the doctors. They were puzzled. On February 2, the famous
Arago brought the affair before the Academy of Science. He him
self, with M.M. Mathieu and Laugier, had observed the phenomena.
A committee of the Academy of Science did not witness anything
unusual, and Angelique was dismissed as non avenue. The Gazelle des
Hdpitanx (March 17) blamed the committee for satisfying neither
believers nor sceptics. How were the experiences of Arago and the
rest to be explained ? The Gazette Medicale declared that the Academy
" had exceeded its powers. . . . The non-appearance of the pheno
mena, at a given moment, proves nothing."
Mr. Podmore (Journal S.P.R., June, 1899) refers briefly to the
stone-throwing case at Paris, reported in the Gazette des Tribunaux
(February 2, 1854). The aifair on February 2 had lasted for three
weeks. There was a rain of missiles against an isolated house, which
was in a painfully battered condition. The police, aided by dogs,
did their best, but could track the missiles to no source. Planks had
to be nailed on to the openings of the windows and the door place.
Mirville, not till the following winter, went to make inquiries at
the office of the Gazette. He learned that the owner of the house
was suspected of having destroyed his own property : others said
that a criminal had been caught. This rumour the police denied.
As for the sufferer, Lezible, the occupant of the house, he showed to
Mirville the debris of his properties, and a scar from one of the
flying stones. " What had I to get by smashing my furniture,
mirrors, clock, crockery, to the value of £60?"' What indeed!
An odd point was that Lezible shut his outer shutters, which had a
narrow chink where the two flaps met. This didn't baffle the stone
throwers. Long thin pieces of tile now flew through the chink !
The secretaries of the Commissary of police assured Mirville that
absolutely no explanation had been discovered. Now it is easy to
try whether Mr. Podmore or I can bombard a house with stones
for weeks without being "run in." If "run in" we could explain
XLV.] Tlw Poltergeist, Historically Considered. 325
to the worthy beak that we were engaged in scientific experiments.
However, the case is not " evidential," it merely donne & penser.
Any member of the Society who can muster up energy enough to
go to the British Museum, may there find a serial styled Douglas
Jerrold, for March 26, 1847. Or perhaps he may not find it. Mirville
cites this paper, at all events, for the unusual phenomena in the house
of a Mr. Williams, Moscow Road, Bayswater. He had a family of
four, and nourished a Spanish boy of nine to ten years old. For days
the furniture flew up and down. The modus operandi of the child of
ten was never discovered, but, being a foreigner, he was suspected. A
similar affair, on a larger scale, occurred in 1849 at Saint Quentin
(Gazette des Tribunatm; December 20, 1849). No explanation was
discovered ; the fracas lasted for three weeks. A case like that of
Angelique Cottin was reported in the Conslilulionel, March 5, 1849.
The agent was a girl of fourteen. The trouble began as she was
putting a child to bed ; a cupboard door burst open, and a quantity of
linen flew at the girl. After that " all was gas and gaiters " :
the furniture danced as usual. M. Larcher, the local physician at
Saucheville, attested the facts. The girl had been instrumental in
effecting the arrest of a rural malefactor ; after his release from prison
the phenomena began. A sack used to fly at the girl and envelop
her ; heavy planks behaved as at Tedworth. The girl was carefully
watched, day and night, for a fortnight, by one of the ladies of her
employer's family. The girl was sent to her parents, and recovered,
but the phenomena attached themselves, at her former master's house,
to a baby four months old. A newspaper, L'Abeille, of Chartres
(March 11, 1849), published the letter of an eyewitness who had seen
odd things in the child's cradle, arriving he knew not how, but he
does not say that he saw them arrive. The editor sent two reporters,
who collected plenty of anecdotes. The curt exorcised the child, after
convincing himself of the reality of the facts : how he does not say.
The exorcism succeeded. Obviously the evidence is always given in
the very vaguest fashion : in each case it is worth a rush, but a fairly
thick band of rushes is difficult to break, and we are still to seek
for an explanation of the uniformity of the descriptions.
As to the Cideville case (1851), Mr. Podmore does not seem to have
found the pamphlet of M. de Mirville, containing the depositions of
witnesses, and I am not aware that Mr. Wallace has supplied him with
a copy. I have, therefore, through the kindness of the Marquis
d'Eguilles and of the Juge de Paix at Yerville, procured a transcript
from the archives of the Court, of the proceedings in the trial of

without going to historical sources. Our systems and theories must

REMARKS ON MR. LANG'S PAPER.
BY FRANK PODMORE.
MR. LANG'S historical researches into the evidence for the Tedworth
Poltergeist incidentally afford strong support to my position. Briefly,
that position is that, when we succeed in getting the testimony of
educated and intelligent witnesses at first-hand, and not too remote,
we find that the Poltergeist's performances were tolerably commonplace;
and that the really marvellous incidents in every case rest either upon
mere rumour, or upon the evidence of uneducated and incompetent
witnesses, or more rarely upon the testimony of educated witnesses
given long after the events. Mr. Lang, it will be seen, has discovered
two additional sources of evidence : the " deplorable ballad," and
Mr. Mompesson's first-hand evidence, given in Court in April, 1663.
The ballad, as might be anticipated, repeats the same sort of
stuff that Glanvil had given us at second-hand—the throwing of
the bed-staff, the dancing of chairs and stools, the pulling the
children out of bed, the attack upon the man-servant in his bed, and
so on. But Mompesson, in his deposition, testifies only to the beating
of the drum, knocking, " several great noises, scratching, troubling the
beds. ' Even this evidence, since Mompesson gives no details, and does
not say whether he himself heard and saw these things, or whether
he is merely summarising the experience of his household, is of no
particular value except to show the utmost length to which a
responsible and intelligent witness could go. Practically, that is,
Mompesson's evidence adds nothing to the evidence of Glanvil,
which I had already cited. Now, I by no means intended to reflect
on Glanvil as a witness. No doubt, as Mr. Lang says, he was " far
from being a stupid man,"and probably he was about as good a witness
as the times could have afforded. But I pointed out that his narrative
was scantily furnished with dates. Mr. Lang goes further, and shows
that the dates given are wrong. I further pointed out that his account
328 Frank Podmore. [PART
was apparently not written down until some years later. Mr. Lang's
reply to this is that the ballad, at any rate, confirms Glanvil's account
of the disturbances in general. But that account is worthless anyway ;
and is not rendered more or less worthless by the ballad. The only
item in Glanvil's report having any value as evidence is his account of
what he himself saw and heard ; and the ballad has no bearing upon
that.
But Glanvil says that when he was present "it shook the room and
windows very sensibly." Mompesson also describes " the shaking of
the floor and strongest parts of the house in still and calm nights."
Mr. Lang doubts the ability of a little girl to perform this feat. Mr.
Lang's experience has obviously been more peaceful than my own.
This shaking of the room by continuous slight movements of one foot
and leg, and doubtless by any other slight movement repeated at
regular intervals, is the easiest of domestic arts to acquire, and also,
Kt-perto crede, the most difficult of all pernicious habits to eradicate ; for
it can be done unconsciously, and is frequently so performed by a
certain acquaintance—if indeed I may claim him as an acquaintance—
of my own.
On the whole, I take it that Mr. Lang and I are in substantial
agreement about the Tedworth case : it is interesting, but evidential
only in so far as it shows that the ways of Poltergeists and children
were much the same in the seventeenth century as in the twentieth.
Incidentally, I note that the parallel case which Mr. Lang cites, on
the authority of a gentleman " distinguished in law and known
in politics," is in a fair way to become itself interesting from the
antiquarian standpoint. When Mr. Lang first heard the account he
does not say ; but at any rate the father's story is corroborated by the
son, now a grown man, but then a child in the nursery.
But Mr. Lang's views diverge much more widely from mine, I regret
to say, on the Wesley case. I will take the points in order, referring
to the numbered paragraphs in Mr. Lang's article.
(1) My argument is based upon a comparison of the earlier and
later accounts by the same witness. It had therefore only an indirect
reference to Mr. Wesley's testimony, in which no such comparison is
possible. But, since Mr. Lang challenges me, I will admit that Mr.
Wesley seems to have been able, without the help of the nine years'
interval, to present us with a narrative which is not tame or
uninteresting.
(2) and (3) Mr. Lang writes: "In 1717 Mr. Wesley and Emily
told Sam, about Mrs. Wesley, things which she did not tell Sam
XLV.] Remarks on Mr. Lang's Paper. 329
in 1717 herself, but did tell Jack in 1726. However, in the letters
of Mrs. Wesley, Mr. Wesley, and Sam, in 1717, it is thrice averred
that in 1717 she 'forbore many particulars,' or did not tell 'one
third ' of the circumstances. Mr. Podmore omits this fact.'
This statement of the case hardly, I submit, brings out the facts.
At the risk of being tedious, I will quote the passages referred to in Mr.
Lang's "thrice averred." Firstly, Mrs. Wesley writes (25th-27th January,
1717): "It commonly was nearer her (Hetty) than the rest, which she
took notice of, and was much frightened, because she thought it had a
particular spite at her. / could multiply particular instances, but I
forbear." The passage, as printed, seems to refer to the connection of
the disturbances with Hetty. Sam Wesley, it is true, interprets the pas
sage somewhat differently. He writes, secondly, in reply to his mother's
letter : " You say you could multiply particular instances of the
spirit's noises, but I want to know whether nothing was ever seen by
any" (letter of February 12th, 1717). In any case, I submit, the
passage will not bear Mr. Lang's interpretation. The refusal to multiply
particular instances is hardly equivalent to the suppression of incidents
of a different and more marvellous nature. There remains, thirdly,
Mr. Wesley's testimony. He writes : " Your mother has not written
you a third part of it" (letter of llth February). On this the only
comment which seems to be required is that Mr. Wesley neither says
nor implies that Mrs. Wesley had withheld any of her own experiences.
Mr. Lang's statement, therefore, that "in 1717 Mrs. Wesley con
fessedly did not record a third of the experiences " seems to me to go
beyond the warrant of the record. The only person who confesses so
much is Mr. Wesley ; but he did his best, in his own diary, to com
pensate for the alleged deficiency. And Mr. Lang's inference that
amongst the omitted experiences were some of Mrs. Wesley's own,
different in kind to those which she did describe, appears to me not to
be justified either by the written record or by common-sense.
Mr. Lang adds that Emily, as well as her father, mentioned in 1717
that Mrs. Wesley had seen a badger. Precisely; but Mrs. Wesley was
not, as would appear from her silence despite Sam's appeal to her,
sufficiently sure of having seen it to mention it in 1717. The conviction
only grew with years. Surely the vision of a spectral badger could
hardly come under the heading : " Multiplication of particular
instances " !
(4) " Every circumstance added in 1726 by Mrs. Wesley was told
in 1717 by Mr. Wesley." That is part of my argument. In 1717,
with the incidents fresh in her memory, Mrs. Wesley refused to " let
330 Frank Podmore. [PART
herself go": in 1726 she incorporated with her own memory of the
incidents the memories and imaginations of other people.
Mr. Hoole's account in 1726 is less sensational than Mr. Wesley's
account of the same incident in 1717. Mr. Lang infers that Mr.
Hoole minimised. I claim equal license to infer that Mr. Wesley
magnified. Securus judicet orbis.
In their later narratives Emily and Susannah omit several incidents
which they had recorded in their earlier accounts, and insert others
which found no place in their original statements. Mr. Lang contends
that my argument, being founded on the alleged exaggerations con
tained in the later reports, is vitiated, because " the omissions arc
more numerous and important." More numerous they no doubt are :
their relative importance, of course, depends upon the standard which
we adopt. I notice that the incidents omitted from the later accounts
are merely additional descriptions of various kinds of noises ; but the
incidents inserted are of a wholly different kind—to wit, physical
movements, in Emily's case movements of a very striking character,
and I claim that these additions, from the evidential standpoint at any
rate, are much more important than the omissions.
Now as to Hetty's part in the business. My demonstration—or
attempted demonstration—of the untrustworthincss of the testimony
is of course in no way affected by the question of Hetty's agency in the
matter. I fear, indeed, that I may seem wanting in chivalry in
returning to the charge. But the indications are so much stronger
than would appear from Mr. Lang's account of the matter that it seems
necessary to do so. My suspicions of Hetty are founded on the
following passages, which I quote afresh :
Mrs. Wesley writes, January 25th and 27th, 1717: "All the
family, as well as Robin, were asleep when your father and I went
downstairs (on the nocturnal exploration referred to by Mr. Lang), nor
did they wake in the nursery when we held the caudle close by them,
only we observed that Hetty trembled exceedingly in her sleep, as she
always did before the noise awaked her. It commonly was nearer her
than the rest." Emily writes (1717): "No sooner was I got upstairs,
and undressing for bed, but I heard a noise among many bottles that
stand under the best stairs, just like the throwing of a great stone
among them, which had broken them all to pieces. This made me
hasten to bed ; but my sister Hetty, who sits always to wait on my
father going to bed, was still sitting on the lowest step of the garret
stairs."
And again : " It never followed me as it did my sister Hetty. I
XLV.] Remarks on Mr. Lang's Paper. 331
have been with her when it has knocked under her, and when she has
removed has followed, and still kept just under her feet."
Mrs. Wesley, in her later account, after describing loud noises
which they heard in their bedroom, writes : " Mr. Wesley leapt up,
called Hetty, who alone was up, and searched every room in the
house."
Susannah, in her later account, writes : " Presently began knocking
about a yard within the room on the floor. It then came gradually to
sister Hetty's bed, who trembled strongly in her sleep. It beat very
loud, three strokes at a time, on the bed's head."
Finally, in John Wesley's version of Mr. Hoole's experience, we
read : " When we " (i.e. Mr. Wesley and Mr. Hoole) " came into the
nursery it was knocking in the next room ; when we were there it was
knocking in the nursery, and there it continued to knock, though we
came in, particularly at the head of the bed (which was of wood), in
which Miss Hetty and two of her younger sisters lay."
Mr. Lang's reply to this is: " It was said (by Emily Wesley in 1717)
to have a particular spite against Mr. Wesley, and Mr. Wesley tells us
that it thrice pushed him about." Moreover, Hetty's habit of trembling
in her sleep was not "singular," because Mr. Wesley tells us in 1717
and Mrs. Wesley in 1726 that the two children who shared Hetty's
bed did the same. I am indebted to Mr. Lang for a further illustra
tion, which had escaped my notice, of embellishment in Mrs. Wesley's
later account. In describing in 1717 the visit to the nursery, Mrs.
Wesley says, in the passage already quoted, that "Hetty trembled
exceedingly in her sleep." In 1726, referring to the same occasion,
she writes : " The children were all asleep, but panting, trembling, and
sweating exceedingly." The reader can judge which version is likely
to be the more accurate.
Mr. Lang has done nothing to explain why Hetty did not write to
her brother Samuel in 1717, though she had apparently allowed her
sister Susannah to suppose that she had done so (letter of March 27th,
1717) : nor is it clear to me why Jack did not obtain her testimony
in 1726, if—as -was no doubt the case—he realized its importance.
There were posts in those days ; and Mr. Lang tells us that Hetty
was on good terms, at any rate with Jack.
To reply to Mr. Lang's summary : Mrs. Wesley and Emily both
assert that the noises were most frequent in Hetty's neighbourhood
Mrs. Wesley and Susannah both mention that Hetty trembled strongly
in her sleep. By the testimony of Mrs. Wesley and Emily, Hetty, on
at least two occasions, was up and about the house alone when the
332 Frank Podmore. [PART
disturbances were in progress. Susannah states that Hetty had
written a full account to Sam Wesley in 1717 ; but Hetty either did
not write or her letter has not been preserved. Nor did she write to
John Wesley in 1726. The presumption of Hetty's guilty agency
afforded by these considerations is not perhaps very strong ; but Mr.
Lang's arguments seem to me to detract but little from such strength
as it possesses.
But, once more, the point is of little importance. Hetty may have
been entirely innocent of any share, conscious or unconscious, in the
performance. The question in any case has little bearing upon the
evidence. I cannot find that Mr. Lang has done anything to impair
my demonstration of the untrustworthiness of the evidence upon which
the case rests : he has in fact unwittingly supplied me with a further
illustration of my argument. My omission to discover this particular
instance for myself is the only omission of all those with which he
charges me to which I am prepared to plead guilty.

FURTHER REMARKS.
BY ANDREW LANG.
IT is hard to make my reply to Mr. Podmore short. I may say that
I did not quote the Tedworth ballad as proof of the facts, but to
show that Glanvil's mythopoeic memory did not invent them between
1662-1666. Mr. Mompesson's deposition is not in detail: I have
vainly tried to recover, at Salisbury, the evidence of his witnesses
and himself under examination. I do not believe that a child of ten,
in bed, could shake a room in a squire's house of 1662. What a
child, in bed, can do in a modern London house, I leave to the larger
experience of Mr. Podmore. My "antiquarian" story, of are. 1875,
is not more "antiquarian" than many in the Society's Census of
Hallucinations, is much less "remote" than several of these. As to
Epworth, we have in Mr. Wesley's notes, the evidence, desiderated
by Mr. Podmore, of "an educated and intelligent witness at first
hand," to Poltergeist performances not "tolerably commonplace,"
not "comparatively tame and uninteresting." We have more in Lord
St. Vincent's account of the disturbances at Mrs. Rickett's house,
Hinton, and in Mr. Procter's notes at Willington Mill. Mr. Pod-
more admits this for Mr. Wesley, and I regard Lord St. Vincent
as a witness quite as trustworthy.
I still do not find that Mr. Podmore, in March, 1899, mentioned
that Mrs. Wesley (Jan. 25-27, 1717), forbore to "multiply particular
instances,''—as she says she could do,—and did not tell " one-third of
it." On this head I shall not follow Mr. Podmore's attempts to put a
special sense on "particular." The reason why Mrs. Wesley gave a
fuller account (which I take to have been oral) to Jack in 1726, than
in her letter to Sam in 1717 is obvious to any unprejudiced reader.
A sensible woman, now free from anxiety as to Sam's and his brothers'
health, with a hundred household and parochial cares, she did not
write "a third of it." On March 27, 1717, she writes: "I am quite
334 Andrew Lang. [PART
tired of hearing or speaking of it." That is the simple explanation of
her brevity when writing in 1717, and of her relative copiousness in
telling in 1726. Emily also, in 1717, writes: "I could tell you abun
dance more of it," but she is lazy about writing. Is not this the
almost universal experience of psychical researchers, when they ask
for information by letter? Mr. Hoole, in 1717, did not write at all, as
Sam desired, or no letter exists, and I conceive that there was pro
bably another letter by Emily, and perhaps one by Hetty, of March
27, which we do not possess. Mrs. Wesley and Emily, in 1717, had
" abundance more to tell " which they did not then write ; if they
were more copious by word of mouth, in 1726, it does not follow
that they were myth making. I exhibit specimens of Mr. Pod-
more's reasoning.
In 1717 Mr. Wesley and Emily say that Mrs. Wesley saw ("thought
she saw," writes Mr. Wesley), a badger (hallucination, no doubt).
Mrs. Wesley corroborated this in 1726, but did not write to Sam about
it in 1717. 1 take it to be one of the "particular instances" which
she then omitted ; but that is only my opinion. Mr. Podmore writes :
" Mrs. Wesley was not, as appears from her silence despite Sam's
appeal to her, sufficiently sure of having seen it to mention it in
1717." But she did, in her family circle, mention it, unless Mr.
Wesley and Emily invented her vision at the time.
Again "every circumstance added in 1726 by Mrs. Wesley was told
in 1717 by Mr. Wesley," I remarked. Mr. Podmore replies : "That is
part of my argument. In 1717, with the incidents fresh in her
memory, Mrs. Wesley refused to 'let herself go': in 1726 she incor
porated with her own memory of the incidents the memories and
imaginations of other people," for example, the evidence of her
husband (his evidence of his own experiences), which fact Mr. Podmore
left out.
It is part of everybody's "argument" that the testimony of
educated and intelligent witnesses at first hand" is the best. Mr.
Podmore gets it from Mr. Wesley, as to the mastiff, for example.
But he omits it, till Mrs. Wesley corroborates in 1726, and then
he dismisses her evidence, as an "imagination of other people,"
" incorporated in her memory," with the same logic as he devotes to
Mr. Wesley's statement, in 1717, that the other children, as well as
Hetty, trembled (Mrs. Wesley adds— 1726—panted and sweated)in their
sleep. Mrs. Wesley, in 1717, only mentioned the trembling of Hetty,
and this peculiarity was made part of the case against Hetty (Journal,
March, 1899, p. 44). Mr. Podmore omitted to mention Mr. Wesley's
XLV.] Further Remarks. 335
equally contemporary statement that the other children also trembled :
Mr. Wesley sat by them alone. As Mrs. Wesley, in 1726, tells us what
Mr. Wesley told in 1717, Mr. Podmore, who had omitted Mr. Wesley's
evidence to the point, thanks me for " a further illustration of
embellishment in Mrs. Wesley's later account." But why did he not
give Mr. Wesley's evidence, and why should it be discredited ? The
logic baffles me. Is it, then, part of Mr. Podmore's argument to omit
portions of the evidence of a first-hand, contemporary, educated, and
intelligent witness ? He calls Mrs. Wesley's mention of the terror of
the mastiff, given in 1726, an addition by Mrs. Wesley, "a decorative
detail." But he did not tell us that Mr. Wesley gave the detail in
1717. This evidence of the kind of witness chosen by himself,
educated, intelligent, contemporary, at first hand, he omitted in the
Journal, March, 1899.
He also, I repeat, omitted to mention that witnesses, in 1726,
omitted parts of what they wrote in 1717. He may reckon the things
omitted less important than the things added. The witnesses, how
ever, had their own standard, and, in Emily's "abundance of more
things to tell,"—but not told,—in 1717, and not alluded to by Mr.
Podmore, may very well be the things told by her in 1726. In 1726
Sukey omitted what she told in 1717 concerning the sound as of a
man walking in her room, in a trailing garment. Mr. Hoole, in 1726,
spoke to the same experience. In any case, when a critic is dwelling
on late additions, he should, I think, also record late omissions, and
the fact that two witnesses certainly and confessedly did make
omissions in 1726, whatever these omissions may have been.
As to Mr. Hoole, I think that I may have misled Mr. Podmore by
my own inaccuracy. I said that "Mr. Hoole," in 1726, "minimised."
The fact is, first, that he does not seem to have been always with
Mr. Wesley, who was alone when some odd things occurred, Mr.
Hoole being upstairs. Secondly, in 1726, Mrs. Wesley says that, in
Mr. Hoole's presence, the noises were " lower than usual," but Mr.
Podmore may discard her statement. But, when I erroneously said
that " Mr. Hoole minimised," Mr. Podmore replies, " I claim equal
license to infer that Mr. Wesley magnified." Memory, I have insisted,
may magnify, or may minimise. But it magnifies in Mr. Wesley's
case ; minimises in Mr. Hoole's, just as may happen to suit Mr. Pod
more's contention. Meanwhile, as before, the contemporary, first
hand, educated, intelligent witness goes to the wall in the person of
Mr. Wesley.
As to Hetty, I merely repeat that there was nothing singular in her
336 Andrew Lang. [PART
case. There are circumstances, and such were Hetty's, in and after
1726, when only a very resolute researcher will vex a woman with
letters about an old ghost story.
May I suggest that as the Wesley papers are very easily accessible
in Southey's Life of John Wesley, the curious had better read them
for themselves? I quite think that Emily, in 1726, did add a myth
or two, as I think I hinted already.
NOTE.
[Two points in the above argument may be briefly referred to :
(1) The evidence of Mr. Wesley. Mr. Lang calls this first-hand.
Mr. Podmore draws a distinction between the first-hand part of it,—
that relating to Mr. Wesley's own experiences,—and the second-hand
part,—that relating to the experiences of others. A summary of Mr.
Wesley's account of his own experiences, including details of what Mr.
Lang calls "the oddest of all the phenomena," viz., his being "thrice
pushed by an invisible power," was given by Mr. Podmore in the
Journal, March, 1899, with instances in which Mr. Wesley's second
hand testimony as to the experiences of others represented their experi
ences as more remarkable than would appear from their own contem
porary accounts.
(2) The later evidence contains, says Mr. Lang, omissions as well as
additions ; thus it does not in all respects exaggerate, but in some cases
probably minimises ; and this tends to show that the additions new!
not be exaggerations. Mr. Podmore, in his remarks above, contends
that the omissions relate chiefly to the less marvellous kinds of incidents,
viz., noises ; whereas the additions introduce various instances of the
more marvellous kinds, such as " physical phenomena." (It has often
been observed that " physical phenomena " tend to be introduced into
late or second-hand accounts.) Xow it is inevitable that many details
should be forgotten after a time by witnesses, and it might have been
expected a priori that for this reason later narratives would generally
be less striking and detailed than contemporary ones. As a matter of
fact, the opposite is generally the case, which shows, as we all know,
that there is a tendency to exaggerate unusual events in retrospect.
In this case the arguments brought forward on both sides, together
with the original records, will give the reader full material for estim
ating the value of first-hand as compared with second-hand, and
contemporary as compared with later testimony, and we do not propose
to continue the discussion.—EDITOR.]
XLV.] Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 337
IV.
DISCUSSION OF THE TRANCE PHENOMENA
OF MRS. PIPER.
BY HEREWARD CARRINGTON.
§ 1. Introductory.
THK importance of the problems arising from a study of Mrs. Piper,—
her trance-utterances and automatic script,—cannot well be over
estimated. It would almost seem that the S.P.R. had at length reached
the crux in its history ; that turning point which it is impossible to
ignore. And, apart from absolute suspension of judgment and
neutrality of mind, which few of us possess, there seem to be two, and
only two, roads open to the impartial investigator : one leading direct
to Spiritism ; the other diverging off, and leading us into a maze of
" unknowns " and speculative hypotheses, which, though ingenious, are
nevertheless somewhat unwarrantable, and do not afford us much
mental satisfaction. The whole case is one continuous series of
glorious uncertainties; of doubts, suspicions, semi-convictions, more
doubts and again uncertainties, leaving us dissatisfied with ourselves
and wondering whether, after all, there is such a truth as Spiritism or
no ! But the problem must be faced ; the last report on the Piper
phenomena has brought this question to a head, and we must decide in
our own minds at any rate as to the source of the knowledge displayed.
There really seem to be but two hypotheses which we need consider in
this case : one, the Spiritistic ; this we accept only after failing in
every other conceivable direction ; the other, any hypothesis or com
bination of hypotheses which affords a reasonable explanation of the
phenomena in question. Of the two, it is hardly necessary to say
which one is likely to be more widely accepted, if only a loophole is left
open by which the other is evaded. There are, in the first place, many
weighty a priori assumptions against the probability of the Spiritistic
hypothesis .in the Piper case. That only one medium should have
338 Hereward Carrington. [PART
supplied us with sufficiently strong evidence of " spirit return " to make
that hypothesis even the most probable one is in itself a most extra
ordinary and suspicious circumstance ; and that we should base our
belief in the survival of the soul, nay, in the very existence of a soul at
all, upon the automatic scrawl of one entranced woman is to some of us
a most stupendous assumption. But a priori objections must here be
set on one side, and the facts of the case met with a counter-argument
sufficiently strong to render this alternative hypothesis at least a
reasonable one. Now it must be admitted that the arguments brought
forward by Professor Hyslop in his Report make the Spiritistic hypo
thesis at least thinkable, and, instead of struggling and straining our
facts to make them appear supernormal and spiritistic in character, the
facts themselves are of such a nature that they force one to seek for
hypotheses that will account for the knowledge shown without reverting
to the supposition that the communicators are " veritably the person
alities that they claim to be," i i.e. that they are spirits. The necessity
of such a hypothesis is obvious if we are to discard that one with which
Dr. Hodgson and Professor Hyslop have supplied us, and it is the
object of this paper to suggest an explanation, which, while leaving
many points undecided and unexplained, yet seems to me to fulfil most
of the requirements of the case ; and, indeed, this is all that can be said
of the Spiritistic hypothesis, which, while it has many good points and
strong evidence in its favour, yet has also many contradictory state
ments to account for, and many extraordinary difficulties to contend
with before it clears itself from all suspicion.
To turn, then, to the Piper phenomena.
§ 2. The hypotheses already advanced to account for the phenomena.
Of the various hypotheses that have been brought forward to
"explain" this remarkable case, fraud is very naturally the first one
which will have to be met and refuted. Until this factor is
eliminated the entire evidence is, of course, evidentially worthless.
But I shall not dwell upon the question here. Every one who has
been associated with Mrs. Piper for any length of time, or studied
her trances, or even the written reports, has, I believe, become
firmly convinced that she is not a conscious impostor. Of course
it is next to impossible to prove this on paper. I am aware that
many persons still continue to believe that Mrs. Piper obtains her
information in a perfectly normal manner ; by inquiries of paid
i Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. xm. p. 406.
XLV.] Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 339
agents, and by the " information bureau " system, if I may so call
it, exposed in the Revelations of a Spirit Medium. No doubt this
is very extensively employed by mediums in this country (U.S.A.),
but I do not believe that Mrs. Piper obtains her information in this
way. However, it is unnecessary to dwell on this point, and I shall
not discuss it further.
The remark is sometimes made that Mrs. Piper's trance utterances
represent nothing more than " the wanderings of a hysterical woman."
It is, of course, chiefly made by persons who have never studied or
even seen the Piper reports published in the Proceedings ; but I
discovered not long ago a very similar statement from the pen of
one of our most valued critics and contributors to the work of the
Society. In Cock Lane and Common Sense (p. 327), Mr. Andrew Lang
accuses Dr. Carpenter of an "almost incredible ignorance of what
evidence is." Now, without impertinence, it seems to me that
Mr. Lang exposes himself to very much the same charge when he
describes Mrs. Piper's automatic script as " very mournful and
incoherent utterances" (Independent, Dec. 1901, p. 2869). Mr. Lang
has openly expressed his dislike for the Piper phenomena before now,
but that is no excuse for his wilful disregard of the specific facts
indicated in this series of trance sittings.
Regarding the theories of fraud and hysteria as removed from the
field, therefore, wo now come to the various hypotheses that may be
suggested as counter-arguments to Spiritism. In the first place it must
be conceded that both muscle-reading and suggestion (conscious and
unconscious), are generally out of the question ; the former, as there is
no contact between medium and sitter ; the latter we may disregard, as
a study of the stenographic reports fails to indicate more than the
faintest suggestions, and these on very rare occasions. As the reports
are verbatim, I suppose they are to be relied upon.
The same objections hold good with regard to hypercesthesia on the
medium's part. Indeed, it is hard to see where this could possibly
come in, generally speaking.
The question of chance, pure and simple, is absurd ; especially in the
case of G.P., and in Professor Hyslop's sittings, as his statistical table
abundantly shows (Vol. XVI. p. 121).
As to knowledge gained unconsciously by the medium : that may perhaps
explain some few incidents, but very few, and is not worth considering
seriously.
Nor will secondary or multiplex personality alone account for the
phenomena; for, though the necessary dramatic play may here be
340 Hereward Carrirtgton. [PART
exhibited, this personality would lack the requisite knowledge which
gives the force to the Spiritistic hypothesis.
As for telepathy and clairvoyance, we must suppose that these supply
the necessary data ; the knowledge gained by some supernormal means,
which supply the personality with the requisite personal memories and
recollections, and give to the sitter the general impression that he is in
very truth in communication with his deceased friend or relative. Of
these two, clairvoyance—as we understand it—has operated on but rare
occasions. There were some traces of it in the old Phinuit regime, but
most of these were in the form of experiments, and there are but very
faint traces of this faculty operating in recent sittings. We are forced,
therefore, to accept telepathy as our explanation until we succeed in
obtaining a better one. But the theory of telepathy has been answered
by both Dr. Hodgson and Professor Hyslop with " arguments of con
siderable force," and personally, I do not consider it sufficient to account
for the facts recorded, if taken alone. Professor Hyslop's arguments appear
to me to be almost convincing on this point. We are left, therefore, to
account for the facts as best we may, or to fall back upon the old and
much despised theory of Spiritism. Most assuredly this covers all the
facts in the case, and it is a hypothesis which we may be forced to accept
some day ; but for the present let us stand it to one side, to be
registered by the world at large as "not proven." (Proof, by the way,
in this case, must rest entirely on comparative probabilities, and so will be
judged differently by various persons, according to their subjective
mental attitude in these questions.)
§ 3. The possibility of combining these hypotheses.
To revert now to the hypotheses, I contend that no one hypothesis will
explain all the facts in the Piper records, and on this point I believe
that the majority of those who read the Proceedings will agree with me.
But will a combination of these hypotheses suffice? I certainly believe
that, with more or less straining, it will. This very point is, it appears
to me, deliberately skipped by Professor Hyslop in his carefully drawn
up Eeport. We find (Vol. xvi. p. 1 24), the following sentence—
" I leave to the ingenuity of a priori speculation the combination of
assumptions necessary to meet the simple hypothesis which I have
preferred to defend as satisfactory for the present. Hence, with the
refusal to consider these, telepathy is the only real or apparent difficulty
in its connection with secondary personality that I shall consider."
Why should Professor Hyslop refuse to consider these ? I venture to
XLV.] Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 341
think that it is precisely this combination of objections which is likely
to occur to the average person who believes fraud to be eliminated in
this case. That, to me, seems a very weak point.
§ 4. The value of the previous evidence estimated.
Now if we go back in our review of the Piper phenomena, I believe
that few persons would care to stake their belief in a future life on any
evidence published prior to Dr. Hodgson's Eeport in Proceedings, Vol.
XIII. Sir Oliver Lodge (Vol. vi., p. 647), classified some 41 instances
which he considered as "especially difficult to explain by direct
thought-transference," but Mr. Lang claims to have " explained " all
these more or less satisfactorily, except the " snake skin incident." i
Vol. VIII. (Proceedings) certainly contains no evidence sufficiently strong
for us to found such a belief upon ; and indeed such was the conclusion
of Dr. Hodgson himself (p. 57). In Proceedings, Vol. XIII., outside of
the G.P. notes, there seems to be—indeed stronger evidence than
previously, but hardly enough upon which to base the belief in a future
life. The Reports in Vol. xiv. are exceedingly dubious, owing largely
to the extraordinary confusion prevailing throughout. If, therefore,
some person, candid, open-minded, but ignorant of this Society's work,
were to ask what scientific evidence there was for a belief in the
immortality, or at least the survival of the soul, and we should refer
him to the G.P. notes and to Professor Hyslop's Report, the question
is—would that be sufficient1 I venture to think that it would not. Of
course the case is different with Dr. Hodgson. He has seen, he tells us,
many private and personal passages written out by the entranced Mrs.
Piper which we have not seen ; they, unfortunately, being loo personal
and too private to be published ! Also Dr. Hodgson has had the
advantage of personal observation ; of watching the symptoms of the
trance, the dramatic play of personality and many other of these
interesting manifestations which we can not witness. Naturally this
personal scrutiny carries far more weight to the mind of an observer
than would hundreds of printed pages to the same individual j and that
this personal and prolonged investigation does tend to convince is
obvious from the position taken by both Dr. Hodgson and Professor
Hyslop. However, the majority of the human race cannot enjoy these
privileges, and, while they should be allowed for, no one can convince
others except on the actual testimony itself; and it is consequently from
the printed pages that we must argue the point.

§ 5. The Piper phenomena are mare spontaneous than experimental in
their character,
Now, in attacking the position taken by Professor Hyslop, I must
differ from him in one of the first and most crucial points in the whole
case. On p. 142 (Proceedings, Vol. XVI.), we find the following
sentence :
"The Piper phenomena are experiments, complete in themselves, and
are not spontaneous occurrences."
Here is where I entirely differ from Professor Hyslop, or I have
mistaken the meaning of the word " experiment." Spontaneous
phenomena are exactly what they are, it appears to me. An investi
gator "sits" with Mrs. Piper and calmly waits for whatever messages
may come through her hand. The conversation is invariably opened
by some " control " ; each new subject is broached by him ; (if by the
sitter as a " test," it very seldom succeeds) ; and the knowledge is offered
or written out quite spontaneously, to be either recognized or disclaimed
by the sitter. In experimental thought-transference, on the other
hand, the agent (presumably the sitter) has some definite idea in his
mind which he endeavours to impress upon that of the percipient (here,
—-medium). It is in his supraliminal consciousness, and no account is
taken of anything which may happen to be passing through his
subliminal consciousness. Thus : the figure 64 may be in the agent's
(supraliminal) mind.—The percipient says 37.—" Wrong ! "—How do
we know that 37 was not in the subliminal consciousness of the agent I
We cannot. Obviously experimental thought-transference must take
place between the supraliminal consciousness of one person and the same
stratum of consciousness in the mind of the other. Were this not so,
there would be no experiment about it. Sir Oliver Lodge's argument as
to distant telepathy, that " it ought to be constantly borne in mind that
this kind of thought-transference, without consciously active agency,
has never been experimentally proved," (Vol. VI., p. 453), is answered
by Mr. Lang in a somewhat telling question—" How can you experi
ment consciously on the unconscious 1 " (Vol. xv., p. 48). Hence it is
no argument against telepathy to say that such and such a fact was not
in my mind (supraliminal consciousness) at the time,—rather the
reverse. Consequently, in the Piper case, I must profess to differ
absolutely from Professor Hyslop in his statement that these are
experiments ; it seems to me that that is precisely what they are not.
XLV.] Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 343
§ 6. The possibility of unconscious telepathy.
Granting then that the knowledge gained by Mrs. Piper is abstracted
from our subliminal consciousness, we have no direct proof that this
latter may not be thinking of anything,—some incident entirely distinct
from that upon which our supraliminal is engrossed. On the other
hand, we have very good evidence to show that such is frequently the
case. " Miss X " remarked that—" it ought by this time to have passed
into an axiom that it by no means follows that what is at the top of our
minds will be likely to tunable out first " (Essays in Psychical Research,
p. 117-18). Similarly Dr. Hodgson assures us that—"on March 18th,
1895, . . . her deceased sister wrote with one hand, and G.P. with the
other, while Phinuit was talking, all simultaneously on different
subjects " (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIII., p. 294). For further proof of
this see Mr. Myers' articles on "Automatic Writing," Mr. Gurney's
experiments in hypnotism, etc.
The point I am trying to emphasise is this :—that the great majority
of the bare facts in the sittings could have been obtained by the medium
by means of telepathy from the subliminal consciousness of the sitter ;—
though the latter's "supraliminal" might have been busy with other
thoughts at the time, and expecting something entirely different.
That is no proof that telepathy was not in operation between the
medium and the sitter's subconsciousness.
But what of the facts that are not known to the sitter and have to be
verified afterwards 1 Of these many are wrong, others are unevidential,
and still others are unverifiable, whereas the residuum may be explained,
perhaps, by means of the latent memory of news subconsciously heard,
or by telepathy from the living person himself. On examination it will
be found that very few facts fail to come under this head ; and
surrounded as they are by more or less irrelevant talk and suggestive
remarks, they may very possibly be the result of simple chance. Such
a theory is, I know, somewhat exasperating to those who are convinced
of the genuineness of the phenomena ; but the following extract bears
out my view precisely, and will be appreciated by all those Psychical
Researchers who have had some phenomenon explained in a perfectly
normal manner, but upon which they were willing to stake their
existence as being supernormal in character. Lord Lytton remarked
that ..." thus it is whenever the mind begins, unconsciously, to
admit the shadow of the supernatural ; the obvious is lost to the eye
that plunges its gaze into the obscure " ( Strange Story, II., p. 1 3).
It will be observed, however, that I here limit myself only to facts,—
344 Hereward Carrington. [PAKT
the actual knowledge shown by the medium in the trance state,—and I
do not attempt to weave those facts together so as to form a personality.
On that subject I shall have a theory to offer presently. But for the
moment I only wish to emphasise the point that all the actual facts
(with very few exceptions) obtained and written out in these sittings
might have been drawn from one person's mind,—his subliminal
consciousness,—and, when Dr. Hodgson was holding his sittings for
Professor Hyslop, the knowledge displayed would yet be explainable on
this hypothesis, if space is no obstacle to telepathy, and the facts might
still be explained in this way, though they might be somewhat less
distinct and consecutive, and, indeed, this proves to be the case.
§ 7. The strong and the weak points of tlw Spiritistic hypothesis.
Turning, now, to the Spiritistic hypothesis, it must be admitted that
there are many facts that point to this explanation as the true one-
For instance, the extremely rapid interplay of personality is, so far as
my own knowledge goes, unparalleled in the history of this subject ;
personalities, moreover, which differ so radically from each other in
character, knowledge and general characteristics. Again, the intimate
character of some of the messages conveyed, apparently, the almost
irresistible conviction that the sitter was indeed conversing with his
deceased relative. But it is the combination of all these wonderful
characteristics which conveys to the sitter the impression of the reality
of this independent personality. As Dr. Hodgson has so well expressed
it (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. xin., p. 360) :
" It is not this or that isolated piece of knowledge merely, not merely
this or that supernormal perception of an event occurring elsewhere,
not merely this or that subtle emotional appreciation for a distant
living friend,—but the union of all these in a coherent personal plan
with responsive intellect and character, that suggests the specific
identity once known to us in a body incarnate."
All this is well known and recognized, but there are, on the other
hand, many apparently irreconcilable points to be considered in
connection with this view of the case under consideration. Granting
that the confusion displayed in the automatic script may be accounted
for on the spiritistic hypothesis as readily as, or more readily than, on
the telepathic, there yet remain many extraordinary statements on the
part of the communicators which certainly point to sheer ignorance, on
subjects well known to them alive, rather than to any flaw in the actual
transmission. Thus we have the remarkable utterances of Rector,
XLV.] Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 345
Imperator, etc., quoted by Mrs. Sidgwick in her "Discussion"
(Proceedings, Vol. xv., p. 32). Mr. W. S. Moses, again, does not know
the names of his own "controls" (Vol. XIV., pp. 38, 40 and 41);
similarly G.P. does not remember (?) his Greek (Vol. XV., p. 42).
All this, of course, arouses one's suspicions, and makes us accept with
extreme caution any statement coming from this source. As a further
example of this point we have the apparently ludicrous statements as to
the occupation in the life to come. As Professor Hyslop remarks :
" Living in houses, listening to lectures are rather funny reproductions
of a material existence" (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. xvi., p. 259).
Indeed one would think so ! To reconcile these statements, Professor
Hyslop has to resort to the supposition that they are "merely auto
matisms," and other purely arbitrary suppositions. For this there
seems to be but little authority, and as the statements are made with
apparently the same assurance as the remainder of those set forth, one
can but wonder whether these utterances are not due in origin to one
initial source, and that source assuredly not " spirits."
The same objections may be brought to bear upon the mistakes and
contradictions in the messages. These have been mentioned briefly in
the above paragraph, and whereas it may be admitted that partial
mistakes and incoherences are in favour of the spiritistic hypothesis,
what are we to say to the absolute ignorance shown, the contradictions,
and grossly false information given by Mrs. Piper's "controls," or the
communicators themselves ? These points, together with the fishing,
shuffling, and tentative questions (more frequent in the Phinuit days
than now), strongly point to Mrs. Piper's secondary personality as the
origin of the entire phenomena.
§ 8. Phinuit a secondary personality.
One of the strongest objections, however, to the spiritistic hypothesis
is (in the present writer's opinion), what he has chosen to term " the
evolution of Phinuit." Now this gentleman—who, we are thankful to
say, no longer manifests in Mrs. Piper's trances—was almost universally
considered to be a secondary personality, and although he might,
(perhaps), have been what he claimed, i.e. a spirit, the facts were so
overwhelmingly opposed to it and there is so little evidence for his
existence that the assumption of his spiritual nature (!) is, to say the
least, obviously gratuitous. His inability to speak French—though a
Frenchman ; his ignorance of medicine—though a doctor ; and his
utter failure to prove his identity, or even to know his own name
346 Hereward Carrington. [PART
(see Vol. VIII., p. 53), all are contrary to the claims of Spiritism. But
it is unnecessary to dwell on this point longer. Phinuit is, I believe,
generally acknowledged to be a secondary personality of Mrs. Piper ;
but the argument of some spiritists is that even granting this, know
ledge was frequently displayed by "spirits" independently of his
control, and which prima facie bore distinct marks of the communicator's
identity ; not to speak of those who have communicated since Phinuit's
disappearance. To this argument I reply that Phinuit was one of Mrs.
Piper's first " controls"; that he announced to the world at large his own
spirit existence as confidently as did the best communicators, and that
it was through him that almost all the alleged spirits conversed with the
sitters, in the early days. Professor Hyslop's ingenious theory of the
secondary personality being a kind of borderland or " neutral ground," if
I may so express it, between the living and the dead would explain
this last point, however. But the fact remains that one of Mrs. Piper's
first "controls" was no spirit at all, but merely a secondary personality !
How is it possible, then, for us to discriminate between Phinuit and,
let us say, Eector or Imperator—neither of whom has ever proved his
identity satisfactorily ? If one is a secondary personality of Mrs. Piper,
why not all ?—for Phinuit's " dramatic play " was certainly equal to
anything that either Imperator or Rector supplies us with, if not better.
In those days the evidence presented facts which tended to show the
influence of living minds as well as those of the dead, but thought-
transference from the living seemed to be gradually eliminated, and the
evidence to point more and more strongly to the action of disembodied
spirits alone. Now this would be perfectly rational on either hypo
thesis. On the Spiritistic, it would represent the gradual improvement
of the "machine "; a "clearing the decks," so to speak, of all useless and
unnecessary encumbrances, and affording greater facility for direct spirit
intervention. On the telepathic theory, on the other hand, this
" clearance " would probably represent the gradual formation of the
faculty for combining suggestions and telepathic ideas into a separate
personality. Of course this is a very provisional theory, and the
spiritistic explanation has still many points in its favour. But because
spiritism is the easiest explanation (at present), are we justified in
accepting it without further attempts to explain these phenomena
otherwise ? Most assuredly no ! If this had been the policy of the
S.P.R. from its foundation, we should never have reached many of the
important truths which it has now firmly established, and many facts
would still have passed for "supernatural" amongst the majority,
which are now accepted more or less as a matter of course, simply on
XLV.] Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 347
account of the reasonable basis upon which these facts rest, and are
explained ; (e.g. automatic writing).
§ 9. An Analysis of " Psychical Research."
For example, nearly the whole range of " psychical research " could
be explained by that one word—spirits—if accepted ; yet many would
analyse these phenomena very differently ! Thus : all the " physical
phenomena" of Spiritism and "Poltergeists" would be explained as
either fraud, hallucination or telekinesis : all clairvoyance, prevision,
and precognition as the result of chance, illusions, and hallucinations of
memory, and (in the first of these at any rate), as imposture very
frequently : all apparitions of the living and dead as either subjective
or telepathic hallucinations : all haunted houses as a combination of
fraud, illusion, hallucination, expectancy, suggestion, and, perhaps,
telepathy from the living or "some subtle physical influence,"—in
addition to normal sounds and noises greatly magnified ; aye, even
thought-transference itself might be a form of "brain-waves" or "ether-
vibrations," granting that it is accepted at all ! Such an analysis is,
very probably, repugnant to many minds, especially to those who have
become more or less convinced of the reality of a " life beyond death,"
and, whereas I do not altogether believe in the strict analysis just
given, still, when once a belief in the supernormal begins to operate,
the " common-sense " side of the question is frequently ignored—as
somewhat repugnant to the feelings of those concerned. But I will
again quote from that clear-brained, level-headed thinker, Lord Lytton,
where he says (Strange Story, Vol. II., p. 284) :
"The moment one deals with things beyond our comprehension, and
in which our own senses are appealed to and baffled, we revolt from the
Probable, as it appears to the senses of those who have not experienced
what we have."
What a truism !
§ 10. Tfo possibility of over-estimating the value of the evidence.
The object of the previous remarks is to pave the way for a few of
somewhat similar type applied to the problem of the Piper trance
phenomena. Mrs. Sidgwick thinks that the "evidence for direct
communication . . . may easily be over-estimated" (Proceedings S.P.R.,
Vol. xv., p. 21). At the time that this was written, the present writer
was less inclined to accept that statement as true than he is now, after
having seen that Professor Hyslop unknowingly colours—highly colours
348 Hereward Carrington. [PAKT
—many incidents which, looked at from another standpoint, fall within
the range of a perfectly normal explanation.
Thus :—Professor Hyslop makes much of the fact that Mr. Carruthers
—one of the "communicators"—does not recognize Dr. Hodgson, while
the latter is " sitting " on his behalf, and during his absence (Proceedings
S.P.R., Vol. xvi., p. 194). Now this is of frequent occurrence in cases
of secondary personality, when, in the abnormal condition, the subject
does not recognize former friends and acquaintances, or even his own
wife and family (see Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. V., p. 391 ; Vol. vil., pp.
249, 256, 257, etc.). If multiplex personality be assumed in this case,
the non-recognition of Dr. Hodgson is certainly what would be expected.
Again, the lack of clearness in the communications of suicides ' may be
due to unconscious suggestion, perhaps telepathically conveyed. More
over, so far as the published notes go, they are surely insufficient to
establish anything with certainty; the element of chance being too
great.
§ 11. Some advantages of the " secondary personality" hypothesis.
On the whole, therefore, there are many points in favour of the
" secondary personality " hypothesis ; and, apart from the supernormal
knowledge displayed, and the dextrous interweaving of the facts gained
into a distinct personality, the only rational argument against this
theory is that the personalities displayed in the Piper case are so
infinitely superior in style, graphic exposition of character, and dramatic
play of personality to all other known cases of a similar character, that
we are, some say, almost entitled to doubt whether or not they belong
even to the same genus. This supposition appears to me absolutely
unwarrantable. It must be remembered that the difference displayed
is purely one of degree, not of kind ; the superiority consists simply in a
greater isolation of the different personalities, and in their far more
rapid interplay than is generally the case. Just why this great
superiority should exist is indeed a most puzzling problem ; and the
only theory that seems at all tenable is that under the vastly greater
opportunities for improvement which Mrs. Piper has enjoyed, over
other mediums, the " conditions " have so benefited her that she has
developed into a stronger medium ; meaning by this—on the hypo
thesis proposed below—that Mrs. Piper's brain has greatly developed
the capacity for combining the numerous suggestions and telepathic
impulses conveyed from the sitter's mind ; that these personalities are
'See Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XHL, p. 376.
XLV.] Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 349
composed, as Professor Newbold suggests, by the " weaving together by
Mrs. Piper's nervous mechanism of all the complex suggestions of the
seance room, supplemented by telepathic and clairvoyant impressions
got in connection with the sitter and with the articles which he brings "
(Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. xiv., p. 9).
In the above argument, it will be understood, I did not take into
account the supernormal knowledge displayed, but merely the unity of
consciousness and individual personality represented. That Mrs. Piper
should be so far superior to all other mediums on this point may to
some appear a strong argument for the spiritistic hypothesis ; but when
one considers the years spent in the careful training of this faculty,
under the constant observation of Dr. Hodgson, it appears equally
plausible on the telepathic. And if we are challenged to produce
another Mrs. Piper for the purpose of proving the theory above
advanced, we reply that two such cases would be just as puzzling and
inexplicable as one,—as either the spiritistic or the telepathic hypothesis
might be again applied to the solution with precisely the same result as
occurred in the first case—viz., a continued diversity of opinion, each
party claiming that the second case proved their theory ! If the tele
pathic hypothesis is a strain upon our credulity, so, taking everything
into account, is also the spiritistic.
§ 12. Comparison of the Piper personalities with other known, cases of a
similar type.
Now one of Professor Hyslop's greatest objections to the "secondary
personality " hypothesis is that, as a rule, the phenomena observed are
far more mechanical than is the case with Mrs. Piper's "controls." This
is undoubtedly the case, and, standing alone, this is a very strong card
in the spiritist's hand. Personally, I know of no other case even
approximately similar to the marvellous " interplay of personality with
reciprocal exchange of ideas, as if real, that so characterises the Piper
case " (Proceedings, Vol. xvi., p. 279). My only reply to this is, firstly,
to again emphasize the fact that the difference is one of degree, and not
of kind ; and, secondly, that secondary personalities are not invariably
as mechanical as Professor Hyslop maintains. To quote one simple case
(that of Ansel Bourne), I need but remind the reader that his
secondary personality—personating A. J. Brown—was so completely
natural that not one of his many newly-acquired friends and
acquaintances ever detected anything uncommon or unusual in his
conduct during a period of several weeks (loc. ctl. Vol. vu., pp. 221-257).
350 Hereward Carringtan. [PART
The case is not in any way analogous to the Piper phenomena, but
merely illustrates the fact that secondary personalities are capable of
reproducing, in a perfectly natural manner, a distinct personality, which
is itself absolutely unknown to, and wholly different from, the original
supraliminal consciousness of the subject. Indeed this is recognized by
Professor Hyslop, for he says :
" The crucial test of Spiritism, in this and all other cases, must turn
upon the question of telepathy to furnish the data upon which any
secondary consciousness has to work. Until it is more fully studied,
we shall have to assume that secondary personality is equal to the task
of explaining the dramatic play of personality, and all non-evidential
data, and base our conclusion upon the insufficiency of telepathy to
supply the objective facts in evidence of personal identity " (Proceedings
S.P.K., Vol. XVI., p. 292).
§ 13. Spiritism versus Telepathy and Secondary PersonalUy combined.
We come, therefore, to the combination of telepathy and secondary
personality as an explanation of the phenomena under discussion.
This is admittedly the strongest antagonist which the spiritistic
hypothesis has to face, but it seems extremely doubtful whether it will
account for all the phenomena recorded, or no. Personally, I am
exceedingly doubtful as to its ability to do so. But if we reject every
hypothesis in turn, as insufficient to account for the accepted facts, we
shall be driven by sheer weight of evidence into an acceptance of the
spiritistic hypothesis. Possibly this may occur at some future date,
but for the present let us set that to one side, and, after examining
all the remaining hypotheses in turn, and finding them insufficient to
account satisfactorily for the phenomena observed, we must endeavour
to invent some hypothesis which will account for a greater proportion
of the facts than any hitherto advanced—or remain without any
hypothesis at all. This last state of mind is certainly anything but
satisfactory ; and it remains for us, therefore, to frame some theory
which will fulfil the requirements as nearly as possible.
Naturally each one of us looks at any evidence presented for our
judgment in an entirely different light ; according to his outlook upon
the Universe, and his own subjective mental attitude towards these
subjects. Consequently, each one of us has some more or less vague
theory as to the source from whence those writings proceed, and it is
upon my own hypothesis, gradually evolved from the repeated readings
of the Piper reports and script, that I beg to offer a few brief remarks;
XLV.] Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 351
not that I expect them to receive any acceptance, be it observed, but
rather that they seem to afford at least a plausible alternative to the
spiritistic theory, without so much straining upon the alternative
hypotheses.
§ 1 4. Tracing the growth of a telepathically initiated secondary personality.
To build up this theory, step by step, I shall be obliged to go "as
far back " as hypnotism ; meaning by this that, in the beginning at
least, we are working upon a (comparatively speaking) perfectly normal
and rational basis. The late Mr. Myers, then, maintained that almost
the only uniform phenomenon in the hypnotic trance was the
" formation of a secondary chain of memory," and claimed that
" hypnotism . . . may be regarded as constituting one special case
which falls under a far wider category,—the category, namely, of
developments of a secondary personality" (Proceedings, Vol. v., p. 387).
Nor is it even necessary to revert to hetero-suggestion for the produc
tion of this phenomenon ; it is possible to produce alteration of
personality by auto-suggestion alone ;—" I have seen a man cultivate
the power of automatic writing. Another learned to change his
personality, while the third would become somnambulic " (Hypnotism.
By J. R. Cocke, M.D., p. 304). In all these cases, a distinct per
sonality (and without any verbal suggestion whatever, it will be observed)
is induced, together with the usual loss of memory on " coming-to."
To revert now to the published experiments in thought-transference.
Few psychical researchers will deny the existence of this supernormal
method of communication, I take it, or doubt that telepathy, from
however great a distance, is indeed a fact. Combining, now, the facts of
telepathic suggestion and hypnotic suggestion we come, by an easy
transition, to the phenomenon of telepathic hypnotism, which is—
according to the definition given above—the telepathic production of a
secondary personality.
This, therefore, brings us at least one step nearer an understanding
of the Piper " controls " than heretofore. We have found that
secondary, and perhaps multiplex, personality may be induced by
telepathy, each personality retaining its own chain of memories and its
individual identity ; yet generally lacking that supernormal knowledge
displayed by the communicators in the Piper case. The trance is very
probably closely allied to the hypnotic, yet is not precisely the same
(see Proceedings of the American S.P.R., p. 105), and the "controls"
would represent, on this hypothesis, telepathically produced secondary
personalities.
352 Hereward Carrington. [PART
But it is the facts revealed by these personalities, rather than the
personalities themselves,—the supernormal knowledge displayed, and
not simply the strong indications of an independent intelligence,—which
cause us to turn towards spiritism for an explanation. Indeed, were it
not for the pertinent remarks and proofs of " shared memory " given,
we should have no cause for supposing that either "parapathy"i or
telepathy had any share whatever in the formation of these person
alities. But as the very "ground-work" of their identity, so to speak, is
composed of these very scraps of knowledge, we must assume that
"noopathy" enters into the case, both in the actual formation of the
personality, and in keeping it, when once formed, supplied with
pertinent facts.
§15. The " Difficulties " of the " Telepathic Hypothesis " simplified.
We now come, therefore, to the very heart of the problem—the
crucial point of the whole case. Granting that this personality is once
telepathically initiated, whence does it derive the continuous stream of
information written out in the trance state ; especially those facts not
within the sitter's memory or knowledge at the time ? The theory of
"discriminative telepathy," if I may so call it, has been met with
almost crushing arguments by Professor Hyslop, and were this the only
alternative to spiritism we should, I venture to think, be almost forced
into an acceptance of the latter theory. But I do not believe that our
choice rests between these two hypotheses only. I contend that the
personality displayed through Mrs. Piper's automatic writing was
obtained—not by telepathy between the medium's brain and distant
persons in this world, but by parapathy from the sitter's subliminal
consciousness : that it was extracted thence in toto ; identity, memory,
personal knowledge, and individual consciousness, just as displayed,
without resort to any source of knowledge further than the sitter's
own sub-consciousness, and was removed thence in one compact
mass, as it were, rather than that it was collected piecemeal from the
ends of the earth. (How this entered the sitters subliminal conscious
ness I shall endeavour to show presently, § 19.) Of course this does
not mean that all the knowledge displayed in the trance condition,
through Mrs. Piper's hand, was obtained at one time from the sitter's
subliminal self, but that the facts themselves were all there, and
obtained from that one fount on different occasions, I do contend.
'For definitions of "parapathy" and "noopathy" see Professor Hyslop's
Report, p. 125, foot-note.
XLV.] Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 353
That facts which we were totally unconscious of ever having known
may be obtained by automatic writing is a well-known fact, and Mrs.
Piper seems to have been the automaton ; thus, instead of our sub
liminal consciousness writing unknown facts through our own hands,
Mrs. Piper writes them for us, the latent knowledge being supplied by
parapathy from our own sub-consciousness.
§ 16. Rdsumt of the previous argument.
Thus far nearly everything suggested has been said before in more
or less similar language, and it but remains for me briefly to
recapitulate, before passing on to this, our last and most crucial
problem, viz., the knowledge of facts apparently unknown to the sitter.
We have seen (i.) that our "spirits" may not be spirits at all, but
telepathically produced personalities, (ii.) That the requisite dramatic
play of personality and unity of consciousness would accompany the
secondary personality thus created, (iii.) That the unverified and
unverifiable facts in the sitting cannot be counted as evidential ; and
(iv.), that those verifiable facts already known to the sitter cannot be
proved to lie outside the limits of telepathy, if the facts were known,
at any time : (a) to the supraliminal, or (b) to the subliminal conscious
ness of the sitter, or of any one within the immediate vicinity. If we
admit the above conclusions, and,—according to the rigorously scientific
elimination process, we should admit them,—then those who defend the
spiritistic hypothesis are forced to base their faith upon the facts which
were, to the best of the sitter's belief, wholly without his memory or con
sciousness, and had never become known to him through the recognized
channels of sense. Of these, a portion may have been known to the
sitter and temporarily or permanently forgotten by him, while another
portion may have become known to him subliminally, but never have
risen above the threshold of consciousness—such as conversations heard
when asleep, etc. Of the remainder of the facts in these reports, it
would be a very nice question to settle as to how far chance may be
accountable for them. Amidst the confusion and excitement in most
of these sittings; amidst the shufHing, stumbling, and "fishing"—(more
common under the Phinuit regime than now, however) ; amidst the
many tentative remarks and absolute falsity of numerous positive
statements, it would be almost surprising if we did not find some true
incidents which would be applicable to any one particular case, either
to the sitter himself or to some relative or friend of his.
But it must be admitted that all this is purely speculative, and

solutions to the breaking point in too many places at once, or the chain
may become too weak to support the strain placed upon it. Both sides
of the question must be judged fairly, and without prejudice, and if it
is possible to arrive at any solution of these problems without reverting
to what Mr. Lang calls " animism," it is clearly our duty to do so ; but
we must not make ludicrous attempts at explanations which are both
unsupported by evidence, and prima facie extremely improbable ;—
" There is a point at which the explanations of common-sense arouse
scepticism" (Cock Lane and Common Sense, p. 60).
Conceding this point to the spiritistic side of the controversy,
therefore, I shall assume, for the sake of argument, that the facts
obtained by Professor Hyslop by means of Mrs. Piper's automatic
writing, were not known by normal means and forgotten by his supra-
liminal self, though lodged within his subliminal memory, and that
chance is insufficient to account for the successful statements made.
We are now face to face with the most—and only remaining—impor
tant problem of all the Piper or analogous phenomena, viz., how is this
knowledge, unknown to the sitter, obtained ? The hypothesis of " spirits "
and exclusive telepathy from widely scattered living persons both
appear to me exceedingly improbable ;—the former for obvious reasons,
the latter because of the vast assumptions necessary and difficulties
encountered within the hypothesis itself. But if we reject both of
these theories (together with " the Absolute and the Devil ! "), we are
forced, it appears to me, into some such hypothesis as the following.
§ 17. The writer's theory for explaining these phenomena : Initial Remarks.
In the first place, I should suggest that many—perhaps all—of the
thoughts in the minds of those about us are constantly being " tele-
pathed," as it were, to the brains of others; that each individual
consciousness is the nucleus and radiating point of hundreds of such
telepathic messages, which, though constantly being received and
dispatched, are entirely carried on below the level of consciousness,
so that we never become cognizant of them except in some abnormal
condition, or under some extraordinary emotional influence ; when this
thought tends to merge into consciousness as an automatism (sensory
or motor). Occasionally one of these telepathic messages rises above
the level of consciousness in the form of a veridical dream or phantasm,
a crystal-vision, a warning voice, a restraining hand (hallucinatory) ;
or, again, in the numerous motor types of messages, such as automatic
and planchette writing, trance utterance, table-tipping, etc. All this
XLV.] Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 355
has been discussed so fully by the late Mr. Myers, in his papers on
" The Subliminal Consciousness," that I need not have entered into the
problem at all were it not for the fact that whereas former writers
have regarded these telepathic messages as rare and sporadic, the
present theory suggests that they are of almost constant occurrence,
but very rarely merge into consciousness, save as an automatism, or
when the medium gets en rapport with our "subliminal," and so attains
the facts by unconscious telepathy.i
§18. Objections to the above theory and replies thereto.
The only serious objections to this hypothesis are (i) that if this
were actually the case, one's brain would be the recipient of vibrations,
not only from one's friends and relatives, but from every living being in
the universe; and (ii) that, even granting that the facts are telepathically
transmitted as suggested above, they would form an indescribable chaos
from which it would be almost impossible to select the right facts for
the person thought of; thus making the medium's telepathic powers
worse than useless : for, instead of an orderly array of thoughts, con
nected with some particular individual, and classified, to a certain
extent, by some unknown association process, with his individuality,
the medium's subliminal consciousness would find itself groping vaguely
amidst a bewildering mass of evidential material, strewn helter-skelter
throughout the sitter's sub-consciousness.
I shall answer the second of these charges first, thus " clearing the
ground," so to speak, for the reply to objection number one.
Now it must firstly be noticed that these mistakes frequently do
occur,—the right facts are given, but in relation to the wrong person.
This is precisely what we should expect on the above hypothesis, and
is somewhat difficult to reconcile with the spiritistic theory. Thus
Professor Hyslop says (in reference to a string of facts just given in his
i Since writing the above, I find that Mr. Myers has advanced very much this
same view, from a slightly different standpoint. In Phantasms oj the Living
(Vol. ii., p. 302), the following sentence occurs: "I conceive that, if telepathy
be a fact, something of diffused telepathic percolation is probably always taking
place. This at least is what the analogy of the limitless and continuous action
of physical forces would suggest. . . . And similarly it is not unreasonable to
suppose that the same telergy, which is directed in a moment of crisis towards a
man's dearest friend, may be radiating from him always towards all other minds,
and chiefly towards the minds which have most in common with his own." See
also From India to the Planet Mart, p. 387-8, where this point is just touched
upon.
356 Hereward Carringtcm. [PART
Report),—"In fact the whole passage is definitely applicable to my
brother Robert, and not to the others." (Proceedings, Vol. XVI., p. 77).i
Much of the confusion in the Reports which was previously explained
as the rapid and unknown changes of the communicators may also be
due to this cause. The facts are more or less confused and ambiguous,
—sometimes applicable to the wrong person rather than to the right
one ; oftentimes applicable to almost any one at all. But I shall not
dwell too much upon this point, for, though many mistakes are com
mitted and considerable confusion sometimes apparent, the result,
generally speaking, is that the incident in question is usually connected
with the right person. We are left, therefore, to speculate as to the
force or energy at work which would separate these telepathic ideas
from different minds into the fully rounded-out personalities, and
combine these thoughts into more or less complete individualities.
There are, of course, two conceivable methods by which this result
might be obtained. (i.) The facts may be associated with that
individual, and classified, as they enter our brain,—thus forming part of
a group of facts (telepathically obtained), which in themselves form
that individuality by moans of some association process ;—or (ii.) that
the facts are in reality in a very confused condition, but are singled
out, as in some way distinctive, by the medium, and combined by her
subliminal self into a separate individuality, in the very process of
abstraction.
It would be necessary to assume in this case that the fragmentary
knowledge gained is in some way distinctive ; each thought or memory
being "labelled," so to speak, and applicable to that one person solely.
This may indeed be the case to a certain extent, for even when our
supraliminal consciousness hears the name of some well-known friend,
it is at once associated with a host of memories and recollections con
cerning that individual ; and we may surely suppose that the subliminal
self, with its far wider range of possibilities, and highly developed
mechanism of susceptibility and suggestion, may discriminate between
the thoughts of one person and those of another.
i See also the following statements in the last part of Proceedings issued (XLIV).
On page 195 (Vol. xvn.) Mrs. Verrall says : " But I have no doubt that a certain
number of statements classed as incorrect or unverifiable are as a fact statements
wholly irrelevant to their context and belonging to some other series of communi
cations." Again (p. 136) Mr. Piddington wrote : " In face of this freah evidence,
I think it cannot reasonably be doubted that the three statements . . . wrongly
given by Mrs. Thompson in trance in connection with Miss Clegg, owe their
origin to reminisceuces of Mrs. Thompson's dead sister, Mrs. Turner, which
' Nelly ' got hold of, but wted in a wrong relation." The italics are mine.
XLV.] Discuasion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 357
As to the first of these objections (that, on the hypothesis proposed,
one's brain would be the recipient of vibrations from every living
organism indiscriminately), the theory just advanced, as an answer to
objection (ii), would partially dispose of this objection also, and it only
remains for us to answer the natural inquiry—why should our friends
influence us more than other persons 1 If this constant telepathic
communication is a fact, why should some thoughts influence us more
than others, merely because they happen to belong to one's friend or
relative? Here is indeed a complex problem, and one which will
require all our ingenuity to solve, but, in place of any better forth
coming explanation, I would suggest the following hypothesis, which,
bold venture as it is, yet seems to fulfil the requirements of the case
better than any other so far advanced.
§ 19. The writer's theory for explaining these phenomena : Continuation
of the theory.
It has frequently been observed that two persons, when constantly
in each other's society, tend, very frequently, to "grow alike," both
physically, in their modes of thought, and in their general mental and
moral " make-up." It is as though their minds had become adjusted to
one another's, so to speak ; that interchange of thought was becoming
both a more frequent phenomenon, and that the process of communica
tion was being facilitated as the time progressed, and the two persons
in question came to know one another better, and to let their minds
run more and more in the same channels. Now by what process is this
mental telegraphy facilitated 1 In other words,—if wo assume that
telepathic communication is a fact, and that it is, in such cases, appar
ently developed, what is the actual mental process involved which
would facilitate its action?
In answer to this question, I would suggest that the two persons
here involved have had their mental receivers and transmitters gradually
adjusted to one another's ; so that, whereas at first only a few " divergent
rays " are received by us, as time progressed and our mental trans
mitters and receivers began to be adjusted at the proper foci to the
other person's receivers and transmitters respectively, the process
becomes clearer and more frequent, and leads to almost constant sub
conscious telepathic interaction between the two subliminal selves.
It will be seen then that, on this hypothesis, facts and personal
knowledge may be freely exchanged without the recipients being aware
of that fact either at the time or afterwards, unless it emerges into
2A
358 Hereward Carringt&n. [PART
consciousness as an automatism, or is abstracted thence by the medium,
and given back to the sitter as a piece of entirely new information.
In fact, all knowledge apparently unknown to the sitter is merely
filtered through Mrs. Piper's brain, and, mingling with her "spirits" or
secondary personalities, is expressed through the medium's hand with
the invariably dramatic setting, thus conveying a strong impression
that the messages are in reality due in origin to the action of disem
bodied spirits.
We here arrive, therefore, at a conclusion which, although it does
not disprove spiritism, nevertheless renders that hypothesis unnecessary.
For, if we can account for the knowledge displayed by the medium
which is, to the best of his belief, unknown to the sitter, then most
assuredly there is nothing else of such moment in the spiritistic
hypothesis, as to detain us from rejecting it as at least gratuitous.
For I claim that this apparently unknown knowledge may indeed be
known to the sitter, although he himself may be entirely unaware of
such knowledge,—it having been gained, by unconscious telepathy from th^st.
in constant association with him ; and that many facts undivulged may
still be within the safe keeping of his subliminal self, ready to be
evoked under certain conditions at present too little understood to be
extensively practised ; and this, it appears to me, might be the solution
of the Piper and all kindred phenomena.
§ 20. Conclusion.
In conclusion be it said that I do not intend this to be more than a
tentative hypothesis, and that I am in no way fighting or opposed
to the philosophy of spiritualism. Realizing, as I do, the tremendous
importance of the question being definitely decided either for
or against this belief, and the revulsion of feeling which must
necessarily follow in the wake of any such thing as a "scientific demon
stration of a future life," it appears to me that, before accepting it, we
should strain every conceivable hypothesis to its utmost before "letting
down the bars " before the proof of immortality. To the spiritist, this
attitude must seem to denote an extraordinary frame of mind ; it is
hard for him to appreciate the tremendous impediments and extreme
difficulty any one of a materialistic temperament experiences in attempt
ing even to conceive any form of a " future life " whatever. But this
is a matter of personal opinion from an " outsider's " point of view.
What one's opinion would be were one in the place of Dr. Hodgson or
Professor Hyslop, it is impossible to say, but for mankind in general, bas-

ing their whole belief on the printed pages of our Proceedings, it would
seem that this absolute proof is still wanting, and that the majority of
us are still inclined to murmur with old Omar :
" Strange, is it not ? that of the myriads who

REMARKS ON MR. CARRINGTON'S PAPER.
BY PROFESSOR J. H. HYSLOP.
THE spirit of Mr. Carrington's paper, which is sympathetic, makes it
unnecessary to waste my time in getting at the issue involved, and
hence I shall simply take up each section in its order and make such
comments on points concerned as the nature of the question requires.
I shall premise my remarks, however, with an important considera
tion which I mean to keep in view in all my comments. There are two
questions in the problem of psychical research in so far as it has to do
with the spiritistic hypothesis. The first is the question of explanation ;
the second is the question of evidence. Both demands must be satisfied
in any hypothesis put forward, whether it is spiritistic or not. The
theory must actually explain, and it must have evidence in its support.
If the hypothesis presents only one of these requirements, it is defective,
and science cannot entertain it, even though it happen to be true
outside of our knowledge. Science forms its convictions not on mere
possibilities, but on knowledge—the knowledge that the theory explains
and that it has evidence. This criterion will be applied throughout
my remarks. I shall use now one and now the other aspect of it as
occasion demands.
(1) Mr. Carrington misunderstands the whole case when he says that
it is an a priori objection to the probability of the spiritistic theory
" that only one medium should have supplied us with sufficiently strong
evidence of ' spirit return ' to make that hypothesis the most probable
one." The reason for making so much out of the Piper case is not that
it is so unique, but that we have in it both quantity and quality of
material to justify the discussion of the hypothesis in all its complexity.
Mrs. Piper is not the only medium from which such phenomena have
been obtained. There have been plenty of them in history representing
phenomena similar in character so far as simple supernormal quality is
concerned. But they have not been the subject of prolonged scientific
XLV.] Remarks on Mr. Carrvngtoris Paper. 361
experiment and inquiry. It is the latter fact, and this fact alone, that
is the reason for putting emphasis on the Piper case. It is the only
one that justifies the scientific man in saying that he has sufficient
evidence in it to make out a case which will explain other less evidential
instances as well. The spiritistic theory does not depend wholly on
the Piper case, but only for its consistency in a large mass of facts and
its exceptionally scientific character.
(2) I have nothing to say regarding section 2, except to indicate
the reservation which I make in regard to the actual explanatory
powers of telepathy and clairvoyance. I make bold to assert that
they explain absolutely nothing, not even non-spiritistic phenomena of a
supernormal character. They are simply evidential criteria ; that is,
owing to the possibility of such facta as they denominate, we simply
find it more difficult to get the required evidence for a spiritistic theory.
Of. Journal S.P.R., Vol. X., pp. 214-215; also my report, Proceedings,
Vol. xvi., pp. 294, and 127 footnote. One of the most amusing things
to me in the whole history of psychical research is the tendency of its
members to appeal to telepathy as explaining both spiritistic and
other phenomena after it has been carefully defined as merely a name
for phenomena still to be explained. The term was adopted to describe
mental coincidences which are not due to chance and which have some
causal nexus, but it is not a name for the cause, and hence cannot be
used to explain anything. As an explanatory principle, it represents
simply the unknown, and all explanation must appeal to a known principle,
not necessarily a fact known at the time. I took special pains to indicate
this briefly in my report (p. 294), where I showed that human conscious
ness . was a known principle, and was only extended in supposing its
continuance. It is thus capable of explaining the same kind of facts
that it explained in actual life. Telepathy and clairvoyance explain
nothing. They are simply names for facts, if facts, still to be explained.
(Cf. Proceedings, Vol. XVII., pp. 248-9 and 261 : Journal S.P.R., Vol. x., p.
214). Hence I deny at the very outset the fundamental assumption of
my critics, and maintain that the spiritistic hypothesis has a fulcrum
of some importance in supporting itself. If it is to be set aside, we
must prove the explanatory powers of the alternatives employed, and
not gratuitously assume that we are explaining a phenomenon by call
ing it a mysterious name.
(3) Mr. Carrington's quotation from my report misses the point.
I was simply rejecting the combination of theories on the scientific
principle that a theory which does not apply in the main features of
its nature to the whole mass of phenomena is not applicable at all.
362 Profewor J. H. Hyslop. [PART
The Ptolemaic theory of astronomy explained the solar system as fully
as the Copernican system, but not as simply. The combination of
"cycles and epicycles" covered the field well enough, but the com
bination was both unnecessary and too complex to satisfy the proper
method of science, which is that a theory must be simple and have no
adjuncts which are necessitated merely by its own inadequacy. The
adjuncts must be known or proved facts naturally fitted to the theory.
The combination of Mr. Carrington has no unity, and is merely
arbitrary. The spiritistic theory gives unity to a far larger mass of
facts than any of the other hypotheses enumerated by Mr. Carrington,
and which he rejects as insufficient when taken alone to account for the
results. The adjuncts which are attached to the spiritistic theory are
drawn from normal and abnormal psychology, and represent known
facts in living human experience, so that in drawing our explanatory
general principle from a known human consciousness and our adjuncts
from accepted psychology, we cover the field by a simple theory, and
must reject the combination which Mr. Carrington mentions for the
same reason that the Ptolemaic astronomy was rejected in favour of
the Copernican.
(4) In section 5, Mr. Carrington disputes my contention that the
Piper phenomena are experiments and not spontaneous occurrences.
There is a very decided misunderstanding here of the passage which
he quotes from me, and which he disputes. I drew the distinction
between the "experimental" and "spontaneous" to contrast the Piper
phenomena with those of apparitions. We can exercise no influence
on the occurrence of apparitions, but we can at least choose the
time for the Piper phenomena and ask questions during the sittings.
These facts give the case the general nature of an experiment. The
spontaneity involved in the phenomena occurs, we may say, only
when the " communications " are allowed to take their own course.
This is for the evidential purpose of excluding both suggestion and
guessing. But asking questions completely destroys the spontaneous
nature of the phenomena precisely as questions in the experimental
work of psychology assume the problems of the laboratory to be
experimental. Besides, in any conception of the term, the Piper case
is experimental in comparison with those phenomena which the Society
has classified as spontaneous. That is what I had in view in my
distinction, and it holds good at least to the extent of showing that
we have a far more valuable set of phenomena in the Piper results
than can ever be obtained by recording casual and spontaneous
experiences. In every essential feature the Piper sittings are experi
XLV.] Remarks <w Mr. Carrington's Paper. 363
ments of precisely the same sort as are the experiments with subjects
in the work of experimental psychology.
Let me also differ from Mr. Carrington regarding the cogency of
Mr. Lang's question as an argument against the statement of Sir Oliver
Lodge. You can answer Sir Oliver Lodge only by experimentally
proving the kind of telepathy which he says, I think correctly, has
not been proved. Mr. Lang's sceptical question, implying that we
cannot "experiment consciously on the unconscious," is not in any
respect a proof that telepathy is subliminal. It would rather show
that it is both unproved and unprovable.
(5) Section 6 maintains " the possibility of unconscious telepathy."
I do not dispute this. What I want to know is : " Is it a fact ? " not
" Is it possible'! " What Sir Oliver Lodge maintained, and I agree with
him, is that this kind of telepathy has never been experimentally proved,
and until it has been so proved, we are not obliged to consider it as a
scientific hypothesis for either explanatory or controversial purposes.
The "possibility" of it may serve as an evidential limitation in the
question of demonstration, but will not be a consideration in inductive
problems. The claim here by Mr. Carrington that " the great majority
of the bare facts in the sittings could have been obtained by the medium
by means of telepathy from the subliminal consciousness of the sitter,"
is subject to limitation of what has just been said. If that kind of
telepathy is scientificially proved, I can agree ; but I deny that it has
been scientifically proved. What people have been doing in this work
is extending the meaning of telepathy without producing the facts that
would justify it. Not knowing its laws and conditions or limitations,
when confronted with an apparent spiritistic phenomenon, we ask :
" But what if telepathy can obtain its data from the subliminal 1 " Then
by virtue of the right to ask the question on various occasions, we
presently surreptitiously assume it to be a fad. Presto ! and the whole
thing is done.
In his reference to the sittings held by Ur. Hodgson in my behalf,
Mr. Carrington neglects to note that many of the facts in those sittings
were quite as unknown to me as to Dr. Hodgson, and that we must
either extend the telepathy to other minds to account for them or
advance the hypothesis of previous subliminal acquisition telepathically
by myself. As Mr. Carrington treats of this latter theory further on, I
shall omit consideration of it at present, and only call attention to
the misconception of the facts of the record.
(6) In putting forward the dramatic play involved in the phenomena
as apparently the first matter in favour of the spiritistic theory, Mr.
364 Professor J. H. Hyslop. [PART
Carrington reverses the order of cogency as stated by myself in my
report. I make that fact purely secondary, and perhaps Mr. Carrington
would do so if asked regarding it. But I call attention to the matter
to emphasise the question of selectiveness in the phenomena as related
to the problem of personal identity as the really strong point for the
spiritistic theory first to be considered, and if telepathy cannot meet
that, it must take second place.
The " difficulties " which are mentioned as suggested by Mrs. Sidgwick
in her discussion of Dr. Hodgson's report, I must dismiss, as they
do not seem to me of any scientific importance.
Mr. Carrington thinks that my suppositions to explain statements
regarding material existence, etc., are purely arbitrary. Now I was
careful to show that in two respects my explanation of such phenomena
simply reproduced the admitted facts of present knowledge. I indicated
as an ad hominem point that I had only to assume telepathy as the
normal mode of communication in a transcendental world, as it is
assumed to be a sporadic occurrence in this, and second, that the
prevailing idealism in philosophy would afford an analogy which
prevented all assumption of the supernormal to account for the
occurrence of such phenomena. Besides, Mr. Carrington neglects to
observe that it is not necessary for me to resort to these suppositions,
as I said they were not proved, and that the essential feature of the
theory maintained was that the "communicator" is in a mental
condition at least somewhat like our secondary personality (pp. 284-5)
while communicating. This again is a resort to present knowledge
and conceptions to explain the occurrence of such messages as he thinks
offensive to our ideas of what ought to occur. I cannot go into details
of this feature of the theory, but it explains how amnesia of both
the normal life in the transcendental world and the past terrestrial
life might occur, and in every way disturb the apperceptive powers for
rightly representing the conditions of spirit life. This enables the
spiritistic theory to explain what the telepathic theory cannot pretend
to explain, so that when you are reduced to a choice between them, the
former becomes preferable, whether proved or not.
The question of " mistakes, confusion, and contradictions ' is too
large to discuss in detail here. Each one of these would have to be
considered by itself. But I may briefly indicate that contradictions,
no matter how numerous, in regard to affairs on " the other side," do
not in the least affect the spiritistic theory, but only the reliability
of the controls for telling the facts about such a life. The spiritistic
hypothesis rests wholly upon facts that we can verify on " this side,"
XLV.] Remarks on Mr. Carringtmi's Paper. 365
and that are unquestionably supernormal and inexplicable by telepathy.
Contradictions about things terrestrial are a positive objection to
telepathy, because after assuming the powers which must be attributed
to it to explain away the spiritistic theory, there is no excuse for
contradiction. Besides, we have no right to suppose that discarnate
spirits know anything more about "this side" than we know about
theirs. They may have as much difficulty in finding out facts here
as we have in finding out about their affairs.
(7) The objection based on what Mr. Carrington calls (in § 8) the
"evolution of Phinuit" misconceives the whole problem, and shows
very clearly how assumptions made for evidential reasons become
supposed facts. After some animadversions on this point of
Phinuit's nature, Mr. Carrington says : " But the fact remains that
one of Mrs. Piper's first controls was no spirit at all, but merely
a secondary personality." Then he asks a question as to the
possibility of distinguishing between him and the present controls.
Now let me say in reply, first, that in my argument I assumed
that the Imperator group are also secondary personalities (pp. 153-
4, 264, 265-6, and 292). But assuming this for evidential purposes
is not admitting it to be a ./•"./. As personal identity was the
standard, I had to test these trance personalities by the same criterion
as others, but their failure to indicate their identity is not proof that
they are Mrs. Piper's secondary personality, but merely a reason for
suspending judgment and conducting the argument on the concession
that they have not satisfied the conditions of evidence. The absence
of proof for the presence of spirits is not proof for the absence of spirits,
and yet the majority of writers and critics perpetually commit the error
of making the assumption which this statement denies. Hence we
must not forget that the assumption for argumentative purposes that
Phinuit was the secondary personality of Mrs. Piper is not equivalent
to the denial that he was in reality a spirit. For all that we know, he
was that, but the evidence did not prove it. Phinuit and the Imperator
group satisfy one term of the double standard which I mentioned near
the beginning of my remarks. They can be explained by the spiritistic
hypothesis, but they do not conform to the evidential criterion. Hence
argumentatively we must assume them to be what they may not be in
fact, but we have uo right to convert a logical expedient into evidence
that they are not what they claim to be. In all this I wish merely to
emphasise the truth—so easily disregarded—that failure to prove a
case is not evidence of the contrary view ; it simply leaves us in a
condition of agnosticism.
366 Professor J. H. Hydnp. [PART
(8) In section 10, Mr. Carrington misunderstands the purport of Mrs.
Sidgwick's statement that the "evidence for direct communication . . .
may easily be overestimated." In this Mrs. Sidgwick is disputing Dr.
Hodgson's possession theory, which concerns the modus operandi of
communication, and not the fact of it. Mrs. Sidgwick admits that
there is a considerable amount of evidence for spiritistic communication,
which seems to imply an admission of the cogency of incidents for the
spiritistic theory which Mr. Carrington here thinks are weakened by
my discussion. (Cf. Proceedings, Vol. xv. pp. 17-18.) But his miscon
ception of her statement makes its quotation irrelevant to the point
which he wishes to make regarding an incident in my record connected
with the " communications " of my uncle. This was his failure to
recognize Dr. Hodgson, of which Mr. Carrington says I make so
much.
But Mr. Carrington misses my point in saying that secondary
personality in hypnosis and other forms shows precisely this failure to
recognize certain persons present. This may all be very true. But
I was using the failure to recognize Dr. Hodgson as a difficulty in the
telepathic hypothesis. I was certainly not dealing with secondary
personality alone in the Piper case, but with a telepathic agent by
supposition. On this assumption I ought to have gotten a knowledge
of Dr. Hodgson's presence precisely as I did in the case of my father,
who had heard of Dr. Hodgson while living, but my uncle had not, as
I had never talked with him about the subject. The curious feature
of the Piper case is that the personalities who, when living, knew or
had heard of Dr. Hodgson, always or generally recognize him, while
those who never knew him do as my uncle did in this case. Why
should telepathy always duplicate the spiritistic phenomena ami nothing
else ? Besides, Mr. Carrington should note that Dr. Hodgson is
constantly recognized during the supposed secondary condition of Mrs.
Piper, so that it is not consistent that my uncle should fail to do this,
except on two assumptions : first, that I was dealing with a spirit, and,
second, that the telepathic powers of Mrs. Piper are limited to the
nature of the personality represented, or rather extended to the
coincidences between what is true of both the living and the dead and
apparently nothing else ! That was the point which I wished to make
so as to show how complicated telepathy might be, or had to be, to
account for the delicate psychological distinctions which it draws,
a distinction which its experimental form seems never to recognize.
The "multiplex personality," which must be assumed in this case,
must represent the multiplicity of the alleged "communicators," aud
XLV.] Remarks on Mr. Cwrrvngtom's Paper. 367
you would have to give some rational account of the consistency of the
Imperator group and their phenomena with the supposed elasticity and
cleavage assumed by Mr. Carrington, as well as the strange tendency
of the assumed personalities to coincide in their work with the demands
of a spiritistic hypothesis, showing psychological powers and distinctions
which now indicate no limitations, and now precisely those which we
should expect on the spiritistic theory.
(9) In regard to the combination of telepathy and secondary per
sonality in the Piper case, Mr. Carrington must not ignore the fact that
I called attention to this possibility and remarked that, as the non-
evidential matter might all be referable to secondary personality, the
whole issue turned on the question whether telepathy could adequately
account for the acquisition of the supernormal facts. Having claimed
that telepathy could not rationally account for this acquisition, so far
as present evidence is concerned, and as the various controls can be
explained by the spiritistic hypothesis, it was not only consistent but
necessary to accept the hypothesis which was most consistent with all
the facts, and so treat it as preferable, that is, as a working hypothesis.
If you suppose that telepathy is all that Mr. Carrington assumes it to
be, then the case may be as strong against the spiritistic theory as he
supposes. But he should have remarked that my whole argument
threw upon him and similar critics the burden of proving the kind of
telepathy which he assumes, and which I do not admit for one moment
as either proved or as having the respectability of a working
hypothesis.
(10) What Mr. Carrington says in section 14 of a " telepathically
initiated secondary personality," is practically answered by my last
remarks above. When such a thing gets inductive or other evidence
in its support, I can reckon with it, but I am not, in an inductive
problem, under any obligations to refute mere possibilities. I simply
demand of every assumed possibility that it present evidence of its
being a fact, just as Mr. Carrington demands of the spiritistic theory,
not that it be possible—for this he apparently grants—but that it
have evidence.
Of course, Mr. Carrington is only stating in this way what is really
involved in the usual telepathic theory, so that, apart from the language,
we have only the old hypothesis to consider, and this is subject to the
criticism that the sitter cannot telepathically produce real personalities of
which it knows nothing, except we suppose that there is no personality
which he does not know, at least subliminally, all having been acquired
in the manner discussed in later sections. But, apart from this
368 Professor J. H. Syslop. [PART
supposition, the limitation of telepathically initiated secondary per
sonalities is found in facts not known by the sitter as we have been
accustomed to define " knowledge." Mr. Carrington must produce
the evidence that such assumptions are justifiable, not assert their
possibility, as we are not dealing in this problem with mere possibilities
but evidentially supported hypotheses.
(11) In section 15, Mr. Carrington speaks of "difficulties of the
telepathic hypothesis simplified," and then proceeds to maintain that
the sitter may have telepathically acquired at some time the facts that
are supposed to be entirely " unknown." It is amazing to see this
called " simplifying the telepathic theory ! " I have a very simple reply
to this contention. It is, Give us the evidence that any such thing
is a fact. I am not going to say that it is impossible. For all that
I know, this and many other things are quite possible. One other
writer says that " the ether fairly teems with the vibrating thoughts
of the bygone ages, and all (sic) that is necessary to become possessed
of this store of universal knowledge is to become sensitive to ether
vibrations and learn how to translate them into ordinary language."
Very possibly, so far as I know. But you would think that a man who
does not stumble at the acceptance of such a stupendous claim as this
without an iota of evidence, would not get excited about spirits which
claim to have some evidence in their support. Now Mr. Carrington
seems to imitate this man and does not produce any evidence that
the sitter is possessed of such subliminally acquired knowledge by
means of telepathy, and until he does, a scientific man is under no
obligation to discuss it in an inductive problem. Only when it
gives some evidence of being a fact in non-spiritistic data can we
discuss it as an objection to the spiritistic theory. Besides, it is
certainly strange that Mr. Carrington should demur to the accept
ance of the spiritistic theory on the evidence of "one case" when
he is willing to tolerate a far more stupendous theory without
evidence of any sort. The Piper case may not be enough to prove
the spiritistic theory, but it has to be explained by some theory,
and as the spiritistic hypothesis seems to have in it both the requisite
explanatory and evidential credentials, it is certainly legitimate to treat
it as a working hypothesis, and exact of every other competing doctrine
the satisfaction of the same demands. I must contend, on the very
nature of telepathy as a supposition, as well as the contradiction
between the magnitude and the necessary limitations of his theory as
applied to the facts, that it does not explain anything, and Mr.
Carrington has given no evidence that his conception of it is a fact
XLV.] Remarks on Mr. Carrington's Paper. .369
in any case, so that neither credential of a legitimate scientific hypo
thesis is embodied in his supposition.
In this theory Mr. Carrington has certainly followed the injunction
which he imposes upon sceptics in section 13, namely, that "we must
invent some hypothesis which will account for a greater proportion of
the facts than any hitherto advanced." Now what I dispute is the
right to " invent " any hypothesis whatever. Newton was very careful
to say in regard to gravitation " hypotheses non Jingo," by which he
meant that he limited his suppositions to known principles, and simply
extended their operation with evidence. If we are to be allowed to
"invent" hypotheses ad libitum without responsibility to evidential
considerations, I think I could produce several theories to rival the
spiritistic, some very simple and some very large. I have never
understood scientific method to permit this, and hence I simply ask
of every theory presented that it present the two fundamental creden
tials of every legitimate hypothesis, namely, explanatory and evidential
capacity, and perhaps I should add, as an important corollary, applica
bility to details. Mr. Carrington has not supplied any of these con
ditions in his proposal. To support it, he should present something
like the experimental data which the Society's Proceedings record in
favour of telepathy, as limited to the present active states of conscious
ness, and in favour of the spiritistic theory. There is not the slightest
attempt to do this, and until it is done, I am not called upon ta
scientifically consider such statements as this : " I should suggest that
many, perhaps all, of the thoughts in the minds of those about us are
constantly being ' telepathed ' as it were to the brains of others," except
to say that they are assertion, not evidence.
(12) In Mr. Carrington's remarks on what we should expect from
his hypothesis in the way of mistakes and confusion, he actually departs
from the very principle with which he starts out in the discussion.
This was to accept the less stupendous theory. I shall not question
the liability to mistakes in the selection from so large a mass of
experience, including both supraliminal and subliminal knowledge,
except that if telepathy is half as large as Mr. Carrington and others
suppose, it ought not to make any such mistakes as are actually
committed. But if we can explain such mistakes by the normal laws
of consciousness, we do not have to resort to the supernormal at all.
Mr. Carrington takes an unverified hypothesis, and then to get out of a
difficulty which it presents, " invents " a weakness in it to simulate it
to the finite which is not in the original supposition. In the application
of the spiritistic hypothesis, I had proceeded upon the implications of
370 Profexsor J. H. Hy«lop. [PART
personal identity, and assumed what must be true on that idea, namely,
that the subject, the discarnate soul, would show the strength and
weakness of consciousness as we know it, and so I explained the
mistakes and confusions by the various incidents of normal and abnor
mal memory. That is, some mistakes can be explained by the ordinary
lapse of memory, others by the amnesia produced by the condition of
secondary personality in which the discarnate spirit is supposed, on the
internal evidence of the record, to be. I thus resort to the known to
explain my case, and Mr. Carrington resorts to the unknown for his
explanation both in the conception of the hypothesis at large and in
the adjunct expressing its limitation. Besides, Mr. Carrington has
stated as an objection to his theory a range of selectiveness that it must
imply, which I think every scientific man would regard as fatal to it
until experimentally proved, and this evidence is not here offered.
(13) The Ptolemaic character of Mr. Carrington's theory is shown in
the " cycles and epicycles " which he has to contrive to make it work.
He finds that it implies subliminal acquisition from every living person,
and then, to account for the selectiveness of Mrs. Piper's subliminal, he
supposes that the thoughts of friends and relatives have a specially
constituted nature to be impressed or selected which others do not
have. Where is the evidence of such an assumption ? Of course, it is
the interesting fact that, generally at least, the "communications"
purport to come from friends, and that spontaneous coincidences are
usually connected with friends. But Mr. Carrington forgets first that
it is only from friends that you can ever discover evidential instances of
spontaneous coincidence, and that it is only incidents about friends that
you can hope to have any chance to verify as a rule. For all that we
know, especially if Mr. Carrington's hypothesis be true, there is
plenty of telepathic communication between living people, but as no
communication of the ordinary sort takes place between them, there
is no evidence of the telepathic impression. It is not necessarily the
mental attitude of our friends that causes the telepathy between us, but
it is the accidental circumstance that we can converse or exchange letters
that proves it, and we must not mistake the evidence of a fact for its
cause. The only resource for Mr. Carrington is to increase the selective
capacity of Mrs. Piper's telepathic action, and so make it so intelligent
and acute that he cannot escape the supposition that it is perfectly
devilish. This is what I had in mind when laying so much stress on
the incident in which my uncle failed to recognize Dr. Hodgson. I was
indicating that telepathy as a mechanical process ought not to coincide
with what we should expect on the spiritistic theory without supposing
XLV.] Remarks an Mr. Carrington s Paper. 371
that it was sufficiently intelligent and self-conscious to know what it
was doing, and if it knows this, it knows that its own work is not
spiritistic, and we have to add the devil to it to make the phenomena
intelligible. That it is devilish may be the correct interpretion, and
I shall not claim to possess data for refuting this view ; but I shall
insist on the telepathist recognizing frankly the implications and
consequences of his theory.
Moreover, the fact of friendship is not an intelligible reason for
supposing that telepathy is primarily affected by it. It may be that
it is as imagined, but to justify the supposition, we must have very
much more evidence than the coincidental circumstance that our
collected data represent experiences between friends. Let me say right
here that I can give a very simple explanation of all such coincidences
on the spiritistic theory, but I have always refused to tolerate it even
for myself because it lacks the requisite evidential features. But there
is nothing in friendship, so far as it is psychologically known, to suggest
that telepathic action especially depends on it, and until some reason
can be found, in the very nature of it as a phenomenon, to create this
expectation, we must treat the coincidence between it and telepathy
as insufficiently understood to assume any general law based on it.
Besides, granting it, how would Mr. Carrington explain the constancy
of Mrs. Piper's supposed telepathy in the selection of memories related
to deceased persons and not related to the living, without also supposing
a most fiendish intelligence in the selection ? Surely the fact that
a friend has died can hardly so alter the nature of my memories
regarding him as to distinguish them radically from the memories about
living friends. Hence, if telepathy is not intelligently selective, I
ought to get a constant confusion of incidents between the living and
the dead, which as a fact I do not get, as the records show. Again,
I say you must add the devil to your hypothesis to make it work, and
if this is so, let us admit it, and recognize a part of our hypothesis is a
fiendish capacity of the subliminal to know just what it is about and
to simulate the spiritistic exactly.
(14) I am aware that Mr. Carrington regards his hypothesis as merely
tentative, but what I am maintaining is that we are not entitled to
"invent" even tentative hypotheses, unless they actually explain and can
present in their favour an adequate body of empirical evidence. The
contention that the possibility of such a theory renders the spiritistic
theory gratuitous is not relevant, because after admitting that the
spiritistic theory actually explains and has at least some evidence
in its support, it is clear that his own theory is quite as gratuitous
372 Professor J. H. Hyslap. [PART
as the one he wishes to set aside, and the attempt to "invent"
it only reveals a more or less conscious or unconscious motive in the
respectability of scepticism for evading the issue. If gratuitousness is
an objection to a theory, and I admit that it is, I must say that every
theory not supported by adequate experimental evidence is gratuitous
and so objectionable. "Inventing" hypotheses simply to get rid of
a perfectly plain and reasonable supposition which accords with the
known both in its simplicity and complexity simply reveals, in the last
analysis, a disposition to make our ignorant neighbours' opinions of our
sanity the standard of truth and scientific method. We need some
sense of humour in this matter. I cannot see that the gravity with
which we can propose or receive the most stupendous miracle in favour
of scepticism and incredulity in any way proves that we are scientific.
What we must realize in discussing the spiritistic theory is that it is
not our business to " invent " hypotheses to prove it gratuitous, but to
show that it does not explain and that the evidential conditions are not
satisfied. To resort to the contrivance of a priori hypotheses, however
valuable as indications that the conclusion has not been demonstrated,
is simply a tacit admission that scientifically and inductively the case is
against you. All that the spiritistic theory claims is that it conforms
to the canons of induction, not that it is secure against the fertility of
human imagination. It may be false, but it is scientific. So far as we
are concerned, scientific method may not be the criterion of truth, but as
long as that is the accepted standard, and I accept it, we have only to
conform to it to throw upon adherents of that method the responsibility
for accepting or rejecting hypotheses which satisfy their own conditions.
On the other hand, if imagination and " invention " are to be our
criteria, I think the admission would be very cordial that spiritism
would obtain credibility on quite easy terms.
(15) Mr. Carrington has apparently taken no account of the funda
mental feature of the theory that he is criticising, namely, that the
communicator is not in a normal mental condition while communicating.
That conception is the clue to many of the "difficulties and objections"
which so naturally present themselves against the spiritistic theory. A
recognition of this assumption, as based on (a) the internal evidence of
the messages, (6) the statements of the communicators, and (c) its con
formity to what we know in pathology, would suggest a unity in the
whole that brings it into an intelligible form. All criticism which
neglects this part of the theory as defended simply evades the issue.
There is no reason to suppose, from any conception of telepathy as it
is experimentally known, that it should reproduce the characteristics of
XLV.] Remarks on Mr. Carringtoris Paper. 373
an abnormal mental condition on the " other side," which we can easily
understand in terms of the various phenomena of secondary personality.
The theory as I have presented it in my report is not grappled with at
all until this feature of it is adequately noticed. The reader may not
be satisfied with the evidence for the supposition, but he should at least
show why it is neither explanatory nor adequately supported by fact.

ON PROFESSOR HYSLOP'S REPORT ON HIS SITTINGS
WITH MRS. PIPER.
By FRANK PODMORE.
THAT no detailed criticism of Professor Hyslop's report on his series
of sittings with Mrs. Piper has yet appeared, is due no doubt to the
extremely voluminous nature of the report itself and its accompanying
appendices. Certainly the mere bulk of the work is sufficient to repel
most critics. Not lightly may one essay to controvert conclusions
which are supported by some 650 pages of argument and evidence. To
my thinking, however, Professor Hyslop is justified in the appeal
which he makes for a patient and detailed study of records that
involve, even remotely, issues so momentous :—
It seems to me impossible to obtain a proper conception of the issues
involved without a most painstaking study of ... detailed records. On
this point I make no concessions to the popular demand for a merely readable
story, but expect from those who claim to be intelligent a minute and
patient study of the phenomena, such as we demand in all scientific and
philosophic problems (Report, p. 18).
After such study as I have been able to give to the matter, I find
that I differ from Professor Hyslop's views almost as widely as it is
possible for one honest and unprejudiced investigator to differ from
another in the interpretation of the same subject-matter. But I
gladly pay my tribute at the outset to his notable industry, patience,
ingenuity, and, above all, his serious and whole-hearted appreciation
of the importance of his task. But my own credentials will no doubt
be called in question, and, indeed, before setting out to explain why
my conclusions on the evidence before us differ from Professor Hyslop's,
I should like to defend my claim to be considered an unprejudiced
witness. Prior to the publication, in 1898, of Dr. Hodgson's monu
mental report on Mrs. Piper's later trances (Proceedings, Vol. xni.),
I had held that her utterances were amongst the strongest evidences
XLV.] Professor Hyslop's Report on Sittings with Mrs. Piper. 375
which we possessed for telepathy, or at least for some supernormal
faculty of acquiring information outside the possible radius of the
senses ; on the other hand, it seemed to me that the indications of
the action of discarnate spirits were so slight and shadowy as to be
hardly worth taking into account. After some conversations with
Dr. Hodgson during his visit to this country in 1897, and careful
study of the Report issued shortly afterwards, I inclined to the opinion
that the case for spirit intercourse was at any rate strong enough to
be accepted as a provisional hypothesis. That in the course of the
four or five years which have intervened my views have gravitated
back to the standpoint which I held before 1898, is due partly to
recent study of the history of spiritualism, and partly to the perusal
of Professor Hyslop's report. The effect of that report on my mind
has been not merely to discredit altogether the spirit hypothesis
so far as this particular series of seances is concerned, but retro
spectively to cast some shadow of doubt on the results previously
recorded by Dr. Hodgson.
Thus much in defence of my claim to be heard as an unprejudiced
critic. Now to the argument. Professor Hyslop asserts that the issue
presented by these records " is simply whether spiritism, or telepathy
from living persons exclusively, is the more rational hypothesis to
account for the facts " (p. 5), and as between these two he gives his vote
decidedly in favour of the former. Whether his preference, as between
these two hypotheses, is justified or not, I have not needed to inquire.
The offer of a choice between these alternatives implies the exclusion
of other explanations. To one such possible explanation Professor
Hyslop does briefly define his attitude—fraud is, he thinks, excluded
by the past history of Mrs. Piper's mediumship. Now, certainly, in the
previous seances recorded in Dr. Hodgson's reports, fraud in the only
form not hopelessly inadequate—the acquisition of knowledge by
private detectives—seems excluded by the conditions of the case. But
Dr. Hodgson's case for the exclusion of fraud was founded mainly on
the records of first seances, held with persons whose names were
entirely unknown to Mrs. Piper. Obviously, if Mrs. Piper maintained
however so well equipped a detective agency, she would find little
opportunity to make use of her information until she knew at least the
names of her sitters. Now the first seances on which Dr. Hodgson
relied were in most cases strikingly successful. But the first seance in
Professor Hyslop's series, according to his own original estimate of it, is
" absolutely worthless " as evidence (p. 20). It is true that, in accord
ance with his mental habit, he modifies this estimate on further reflec
376 Frank Podmore. [PART
tion, and is now of opinion that "it could be made quite intelligible,
if not slightly evidential, by disentangling its threads of suggestive
possibilities." But his original judgment remains on record, and I doubt
if many readers will be inclined to dispute it. The first seance, then,
in the series may be called a failure. But clearly, without imputing
deliberate fraud of a kind of which Mrs. Piper's past history affords no
indication, at each seance after the first it became more and more
likely that the true statements may have been founded on knowledge
normally acquired by the medium, either in her waking state from
things heard and read, or in the trance by inference from things let drop
by the sitter, or generally from his acceptance or rejection of previous
utterances ; and these normal channels of information were possibly
wide enough to have conveyed everything in the later seances whicb
was true and relevant. Now, to this question Professor Hyslop has not
addressed himself at all. He contents himself with refusing to discuss
the possibility of fraud, in what he considers the only form conceiv
able in the case, that is, the employment of detectives for obtaining
information (p. 6), on the ground that that hypothesis was excluded
ten years ago (p. 5). But in connection with the strikingly successful
groups, mostly of first seances, recorded by Dr. Hodgson and others in
previous reports, there was no need to insist upon the possible operation
of such familiar causes as chance-coincidence, fishing, inference from
hints let drop at the sitting, or the reproduction of information casually
acquired by the medium before the seance, because the facts stated at
these seances were often so detailed and accurate as to make the mere
suggestion of such an explanation ridiculous. The question of deli
berate and systematic fraud was discussed and rejected, not merely as
being inadequate to the results, but as being, with anonymous sitters,
practically impossible. In considering the present records, however, in
which the first seance was a failure, and the chief successes were scored
towards the end of a series which extended over many months, when
the sitter had long ceased to be anonymous, we may perhaps exclude
fraud, but we are not equally entitled to exclude chance-coincidence,
skilful inference, and the reproduction of information casually acquired.
Professor Hyslop says indeed (p. 11) that he was careful to avoid
giving suggestions, either muscular or by his questions. But it
appears from the record that he generally let the medium know
whether her statements were right or wrong, so that she might have
been enabled gradually to correct them, which she seems to have
done.
In considering generally from the evidential standpoint the utter
XLV.] Professor Hyslop's Report on Sittings with Mrs. Piper. 377
ances at Mrs. Piper's later seances, it is to be noted first, that the
machinery of the trance communication is by no means simple, or even
intelligible, except with expert interpretation. Mrs. Piper is entranced,
and apparently unconscious of what goes on. The messages given are
written through her hand. The intelligence which inspires those
messages, whatever its precise nature, is certainly complex, and of an
unusual if not unique kind. The view of the process of communication
provisionally adopted by Dr. Hodgson and Professor Hyslop is that
Mrs. Piper's organism is made use of by the spirits of certain deceased
persons for the purpose of communicating with their friends who are
still living here. But for the most part that communication is supposed
to take place in an indirect way. Professor Hyslop's father does
not, ex hypothesi, himself control the bodily movements of Mrs. Piper.
That function is too delicate and uncertain to be entrusted to any but
an expert spirit. Professor Hyslop's father, uncle, brother, or other
communicating spirit, dictates, therefore, what he wishes said to one of
the customary controls, usually "Rector" or "G. P.," who in turn
translates the messages somehow into terms of Mrs. Piper's muscular
activity. But occasionally the ordinary process is interrupted by the
intrusion of alien spirits, who either succeed temporarily in obtaining
possession of Mrs. Piper's organism or divert the attention of the
controlling spirit. Once more, the supposed orderly process may be
interrupted by "automatisms"—vague, meaningless remarks thrown
out by the communicating spirit (or by Mrs. Piper's own subliminal
consciousness). Thus on p. 332 occurs the remark, "Do you hear
her sing 1 " This remark is not, to the uninstructed reader, more out
of place than many other remarks interjected in the course of the trance-
writings. But it is not recognised by Professor Hyslop as relevant,
and is dismissed as " one of the automatisms which are quite frequent
in these sittings" (p. 352, note). Now, cumbrous and far-fetched
though this hypothesis of communication at two removes may appear,
there can be little doubt that it has a very direct relation to the
observed phenomena, so direct that we are practically confined to the
choice of one out of two alternatives—the hypothesis either accurately
represents the facts, or is itself responsible for the appearances which
suggest those facts. If Mrs. Piper's organism is not controlled by
spirits in the manner supposed, we are forced to conclude that her
trance utterances have been moulded to their present form so as to
accord with a theory gradually elaborated by Dr. Hodgson and his
fellow-workers.
The practical result of this complicated mechanism is that the
378 Frank Podmore. [PART
messages delivered through the entranced Mrs. Piper are extraordi
narily ambiguous and uncertain in their interpretation. To begin with
the simplest difficulty, the actual script is extremely indistinct, and can
apparently only be read, if read at all, by those who, like Dr. Hodgson
himself, have had long practice in deciphering it. In some instances
quoted in the reports it seems to have baffled even Dr. Hodgson.
The ambiguity of the writing may sometimes have given openings bv
which the trance intelligence could gain information. Consider, for
instance, this passage :
" I am with her (with whom ?). Yes, I have A A [undec.,
possibly either Alice or Annie]. (Is it Alice?) Alice (Alice who?) / da
not say Alice, I say Annie" (p. 307).
This is quite in Phinuit's old style. Again, in one place the word
" mother " is printed five times, but " a close re-examination of the
original automatic writing indicates that the first of these words looks
like 'mother.' The others look like 'brother'" (p. 316). On another
occasion the sitter asks, " Who passed out soon after you ? " The
answer given is "mother [? brother] is here also" (p. 331). In some
cases the indistinctness of the writing may even have led to uncon
scious perversion of the record. In one case, e.g., the sitter asks for
the name of a younger brother to be given. The writing proceeds :
"Cannot hear you. Do not hurry so. Do you mean F f
(Sitter: 'Yes, father, I mean F., if you can tell the rest.') 'Yes,
I can remember very well, FRAD (?).'" Professor Hyslop then
explains that the symbol printed as D was really very like NK,
and that Frank was the brother's name (pp. 337-8). One cannot
help wondering whether, if the brother's uame had happened to be
Fred, the resemblance of the last character to NK would have
seemed to Professor Hyslop quite so conspicuous.
But, after all, the writing is the least of the difficulties in the
interpretation of these communications. The really serious obstacle
lies in the nature of the communications themselves. There is a
large amount of what, for our present purposes, we must dismiss as
mere padding. The controlling spirits are voluble in protesting that
they will do their best ; asking the sitter to have patience ; complain
ing of the conditions, and so on. This part of the communications
is coherent enough, but not evidential. The messages of deceased
relatives are for the most part fragmentary and incoherent. They
are also indirect, tentative, and ambiguous in form. Last of all, they
frequently, perhaps generally in the earlier sittings, contain no indica
tion of the identity of the supposed communicator. That identity
XLV.] Professor Hyslop's Report on Sittings with Mrs. Piper. 379
has to be inferred from internal evidence. In other words, the message
is assigned to the relative to whom it would be most appropriate.
Thus, to take one case out of many, Professor Hyslop explains that at
a certain part of the first sitting he originally supposed himself to be
communicating with his brother, but later saw reason, purely from
internal evidence, to suppose that his father, not his brother, was the
communicator (pp. 22. 307, and 361). In other words, the messages
for the most part bear no label of origin ; in some cases they bear no
label of destination either. Names are thrown out haphazard, to be
taken up and identified or left, as the sitter wills. Thus, to take a
salient case, at the second sitting the " control " announces that there is
a little girl-spirit trying to find her mother. He then proceeds :
" Who is Ruth 1
(Hyslop : I do not know Ruth.)
Not to thee, friend, but to thee [i.e. it refers to R.H.]" (p. 319).
If we were dealing with the ordinary professional clairvoyant, who
describes, before a roomful of her clients, the apparition of a sweet-
faced widow lady, or an old gentleman with silver hair, or some other
typical figure, we should say that the conditions were cunningly
devised to ensure that her clairvoyant descriptions should never fail to
find a billet somewhere. In reality, ambiguous messages of the kind
often dealt in by Mrs. Piper, bearing marks neither of origin nor of
destination, widen the scope of chance-coincidence in much the same
way, though no doubt to a less extent. Obviously the cap is more
likely to be found to fit if it is not aimed at one particular head.
The evidential value of fragmentary, incoherent, and indirect state
ments of the kind here dealt in by the trance-intelligence is extremely
difficult to estimate. Taken as they stand, many of them are meaning
less. To have any meaning, they require to be filled in or inter
preted. It is, of course, in the process of filling in or interpretation
that the real danger lies. The material is so vague that several inter
pretations would often fit about equally well, and the interpreter
is tempted to choose that meaning which best accords with his wishes
or his preconceptions.
But to come to particulars. It would obviously be impracticable,
within reasonable limits of space, to analyse the evidence presented by
the whole series of sittings. Nor is any such complete analysis
necessary. As already pointed out, the information given at a pro
longed series of sittings is of course less and less valuable as evidence
for supernormal activity (spirits, telepathy, or anything else) the later
it comes in the series. At each sitting the medium starts with a
380 Frank Podmore. [PART
larger stock of information, normally acquired, than at the sitting
which went before. Moreover, as the sittings proceed, the medium
obviously has more and more opportunities of acquiring information
from outside sources. I do not suggest that the medium, in the present
case, made any illegitimate use of any outside source of information which
may have been accessible to her; but clearly that possibility is not
one which we can altogether exclude. For this reason I should have
preferred to begin my analysis of Professor Hyslop's records with the
first sitting. But as the first seance was at the best inferior to the
others, in order not to treat the case unfairly I have chosen the second
seance for detailed analysis.i As the first seance, however, is evi
dentially the critical one, I have thought it well to give a brief
summary of its results, which does not greatly differ from Professor
Hyslop's own statistical summary in the table printed on p. 118 of his
Report.
After the preliminary conversation with the controlling spirits, there
enter at the first sitting a lady with gloves and a little girl, who do
not give their names and who fail to obtain recognition. Thereafter,
in the course of the sitting, seventeen names are introduced spon
taneously by the trance-intelligence. Of these, five—Margaret, Annie,
Charles, Willie, and Elizabeth—are correct; but it should be added
that the lady introduced as Elizabeth was known in life as Eliza. Of
the remaining names 11 are incorrect, viz., Lillie, Alice, Henry, Albert,
Alfred, Mr. Morse, Walter, Edwards, Ell-el, Robertson, Corrie. But
" Lillie," we are told, would have been correct and pertinent if it had
been Sarah Luella ; " Ell-el " might be an attempt at Eliza ; " Robert
son " would have a meaning if it were Robert's son ; and " Corrie "
might have been intended for Mary or for Cornelia. Finally, there is
a name not deciphered, but probably intended for Ellen or Allen. On
this Professor Hyslop comments, "Allan (sic) could have one possible
meaning, and Ellen two."
The amount of coincidence here is clearly not more than chance
would afford. In fact, the trance-intelligence may be accounted
distinctly unlucky in scoring only 5 successes in 16 trials with quit*
commonplace names. Probably in most English families, at any rate,
the number of hits would have been greater.
The second sitting was, according to the statistical summary, one of
the most uniformly successful of the whole series. There are,
according to Professor Hyslop, 12 "incidents," resoluble into 49
i See Professor Hyslop's remarks on the first seance (Report, pp. 20 and 21)
and his statistical summary, on p. 118, of the statements contained in it.
XLV.] Professor Hyslop's Report on Sittings with Mrs. Piper. 381
"factors," of which 45 are true, 3 indeterminate, and one false.
Clearly, therefore, we shall do no injustice to the record if, having
perforce to content ourselves with analysing a sample, we choose the
second seance for the purpose.
Now there is one, and, so far as I can find, only one definite true
statement made at this seance. The full name of the sitter—James
Hyslop—is given. Even that information is given piecemeal—the
" James " at the beginning, the " Hyslop " at the end of the sitting—
a procedure which, if fraud were in question, would certainly seem
suspicious.
If the sitter's name had been given at the first seance, when the
precautions taken against the discovery of his identity seem to have
been pretty complete, it would have been a valuable piece of evidence.
Coming, in this piecemeal fashion, 24 hours later, when the medium
had had the opportunity of passing in review the events of the first
sitting, and the names of likely sitters, we cannot assign so much
weight to it. Professor Hyslop's general interest in the subject was
known, since he had lectured on psychical research even in his
father's lifetime. And to Miss Edmunds, at any rate, it appeared
probable that he was one of the persons who would apply to
have sittings with Mrs. Piper (see p. 345). In the circumstances
the name " James " may have been a " try-on," the favourable
reception of which would justify the confident ejaculation of
" Hyslop " at the end of the sitting. Excluding " Ruth," of which
we have already spoken, four other names were correctly given at
this seance—George, Charles, Willie, and Eliza (Elizabeth). All these
had been introduced at the previous seance, the first-named by Professor
Hyslop himself. Moreover, the relationship (brother) of George and
Charles had also been indicated at the preceding seance ; and the rela
tionship of Willie and Eliza is not precisely indicated in the second
seance. Three names are incorrectly introduced — " Robertson,"
'• Elsie " (which is promptly changed, after repudiation by the sitter,
to Eliza), and "Uncle Charles." The sitter remarks that he does not
know any Uncle Charles. The trance-intelligence replies : " I think
is not a real uncle ; you must remember what I mean." Professor
Hyslop's comment is : " With the resemblance of the word Charles
(slight resemblance only, and noticeable only to those familiar with
these sittings) to this uncle's name, and the fact that he was not a real
uncle, the incident has a perfectly definite meaning" (p. 316). He was
apparently an uncle by marriage, and his name, as we learn later, was
James B. Carruthers.
382 Frank Pod-more. [PART
There is one other quite definite statement made at the sitting.
Professor Hyslop's father was, he says, "the last to come here." This
is claimed as correct, and it is correct if understood to apply only to
the immediate family. It is not even true of blood-relations, for
Professor Hyslop's cousin, Kobert H. M'Clellan, had died since (p. 17).
Still less is it true of the communicators in general, for the uncle by
marriage, who is supposed to be communicating through a considerable
part of this same seance, had also died after Mr. Hyslop, senior.
Supposing that the form of the sentence had been modified, and Mr.
Hyslop's spirit had said that he was the last but one to come here, or
even the last but two, would Professor Hyslop have written down either
of these statements as false ?
If we turn to the substance of the communications, we shall find
them much more coherent than in the previous sitting, but on the
other hand there are fewer definite statements. The intelligence
communicating is much freer, and seems more sure of the ground, but
contrives to utter very little beyond the commonplace or the readily
conjecturable.
I will briefly summarise the various points, omitting the purely
general topics, such as the difficulties of communicating, the pleasure
of meeting the sitter again, the grief of those left behind, etc., matters
which make up a large part of the communication :
(A) After the introduction of the two names, "James" and
"Willie," comes the advice, "Do not work too hard." This com
munication is interpreted as coming from the sitter's father.
(B) A few lines introducing Brother Charles, and interpreted as
coming from him.
(C) A passage with the advice : " Don't worry ; " a reference to
" trouble in your (sitter's) head," which Professor Hyslop cannot
distinctly remember. The passage concludes with the words, " Tired
out."
In the detailed notes (p. 314) the passage is interpreted as coming
from the father. But in the report (p. 28) it is apparently assigned
to the uncle.
(D) "E—Elsie, El—Elsie" is written. Sitter repudiates the
name Elsie, and it is immediately changed to Eliza. Then follows
general talk about the loneliness and grief of Eliza, after the sitter had
intimated by his question that Eliza was still living.
This passage is referred to the sitter's uncle, James Carruthers.
(E) A reference to "Uncle Charles," with the explanation, added
after repudiation by sitter of the suggested relationship : " Not a real
XLV.] Professor Hyslop's Report on Sittings with Mrs. Piper. 383
uncle ; " a statement that he (or the sitter) " used to be so nervous ; "
a message to " the girls ; " a question, " Have you seen the children
yet ; " a reference to George, and then : " Are you troubled about
him ? He is all right and will be, James." Then the advice : " Worry
not ; " and the recognition of the accordion, which had been brought to
the seance, with other things belonging to the late Mr. Hyslop, in
accordance with the usual practice at these seances of bringing objects
familiar to the deceased person who is supposed to communicate.
This passage is interpreted as coming from the father.
(F) Another reference to "Eliza," and a decided change in the
attitude of the communicating intelligence, possibly inspired by the
sitter, who on the introduction of the name Eliza remarks : " Tell us
who are with you, and that will help Eliza."
The passage is referred to the uncle.
(G) A reference to the sitter's lectures, and to his scepticism about a
future life.
Eeferred to the father.
(H) The Ruth episode.
(I) Sitter's father states he was "the last to come here." More
reference to sitter's difficulties and scepticism.
(K) Sitting ends with Mrs. Piper's ejaculation of the sitter's surname
—Hyslop.
It will be seen from this bald summary—the accuracy of which can
be tested by reference to the full report of the sitting—that, if we
omit the reference to the trouble with George, there is nothing in the
statements made to call even for the exercise of telepathy. There is
certainly a shrewd appreciation of Professor Hyslop's own character,
and of the relations subsisting between him and his father ; in short, a
dramatic realisation of the situation generally. But a person of
somewhat more than the ordinary acuteness and sympathetic insight
into character would probably have made as good a show by utilising
the experience gained at the first sitting, even if the identity of the
sitter remained unknown. But, as already said, it seems possible
that, in the twenty-four hours which elapsed between the first sitting
and the second, Mrs. Piper's trance-intelligence had penetrated Pro
fessor Hyslop's disguise ; and that when he came for the second time she
knew or strongly suspected who he was. Such an assumption seems,
however, hardly necessary to explain the results. The things said are
the mere commonplace of mediumistic seances ; the attitude indicated
of the older to the younger generation is far from being uncommon; in
384 Frank Podmore. [PART
short, the whole situation is such as might have been divined by an
intelligence far inferior to that of Mrs. Piper's trance-personality. But
Professor Hyslop says that not only the ideas, but the form in which
they are conveyed, were characteristic of his father. Here, again, the
phraseology seems too little distinctive to justify any certain inference.
They are phrases which, in this country at any rate, would naturally
come from the mouth of a medium playing, with some plausibility it
must be admitted, the part here assumed. But let the reader judge for
himself. Here are the chief words and phrases used at the seance, and
claimed as characteristic : " Give me my hat and let me go ; " " Tired
out ; " " It was me [the " me " is natural for father] " ; " What is their
loss is our gain ; " " Stick to this ; " " Do you recall your lectures, and,
if so, to whom do you recite them now ? [this word " recite " is very
singular: it is like him];" "Well, I was not so far wrong, after all;"
" You had your own ideas ; " " Well, it is not a fault ; " " Sincerity of
purpose ; " " All the difficulties which you encounter," etc., etc.
One more point before we leave the consideration of this seance. In
the statistical summary already mentioned Professor Hyslop enumerates
49 separate factors, of which one only is classed as false. There were
three incorrect names given — "Elsie," "Robertson," and "Uncle
Charles." Which of them is classed as " false," and which as " true "
or " indeterminate " ?
Let us now take a sample from another part of the series. In
February, 1899, Dr. Hodgson held five sittings with Mrs. Piper, on
Professor Hyslop's behalf, in the absence of that gentleman. I propose
to deal with the first of these, partly because it is the first, partly
because, as containing no " mixed " or " indeterminate " statements,
it is the simplest. Every statement is classed, in the statistical summary,
as true or false: there are 8 true incidents, consisting of 14 factors,
and 2 false incidents, one containing 4 and the other 6 factors, or 14
true factors against 10 false; on the whole a favourable balance. I
cannot, by any system of calculation, make my analysis of the sitting
agree with Professor Hyslop's. The false factors can readily be
identified ; indeed I make the total sum rather larger. But the true
factors, on the most favourable interpretation, amount, according to my
reckoning, to 1 1 only. But let the reader judge. The relevant matter
begins about half way down page 370.
Rector is represented as explaining to the spirit of Professor
Hyslop's father that the sitter is "not James, but Hodgson." The
spirit then says that he wants to speak to James (one true factor), and
refers to a previous conversation on the subject of Emanuel Swedenborg
XLV.] Professor Hydop's Report on Sittings with Mrs. Piper. 385
(one true incident, consisting of two factors, but clearly not evidential,
as the reference to Swedenborg had been made at a previous sitting).
Then follows the precise statement by the spirit : " I am thinking of
the time some years ago when I went into the mountains for a change
with him, and the trip we had to the lake after we left the camp " (one
wholly false incident of 4 factors).
Next comes a long and definite, though fragmentary, account of a
trip out west, and an accident to the train, owing to the engine going
through a bridge, which delayed their journey several days, and gave
his father a nervous shock, from which he never fully recovered (one
wholly false incident of 6 factors).
There is a vague reference to a fire (one true factor, but not
evidential, as it had already cropped up at previous sittings).
After the mention of the fire, and the railway accident, and the
nervous shock, comes the statement: "I have now completely recovered
from this, and I can walk about as well as ever I could" (p. 372).
Apparently Professor Hyslop counts this statement as true (one " true "
incident of 2 factors).
A reference to "long talks" on "possibilities of communication"
(one true incident of 2 factors).
A spectacle case is produced. The spirit recognises the case as
having been his own, and states correctly that he called the glasses
" spectacles " (one true incident of 2 factors).
There is then a reference to " Nannie." As there was apparently no
person named Nannie to whom a reference here could be pertinent,
I should class " Nannie " as false, or, at best, as indeterminate. But
it seems clear from the summary that Professor Hyslop has classed
it as true, on the assumption that " Nannie " was Rector's mistake for
" Maggie " (one false factor).
The only other evidential statement in the seance occurs on p. 375,
an allusion to Professor Hyslop being in New York at the time (one
true factor, but, as Professor Hyslop points out, the statement has
little evidential value).
To sum up, then, I find 11 false factors as against 10, and 11 true as
against 14, on Professor Hyslop's reckoning.
Practically not one of the 1 1 true factors has any value as evidence,
being either repetition of statements made at previous sittings, or, as
in the case of the recognition of the spectacle case, things such as the
medium could readily infer without extraneous assistance.
But the false statements are new, precise, and categorical. And
Professor Hyslop adopts a very curious method of dealing with
386 Frank Podmore. [PART
them. The statement that Mr. Hyslop, senior, went with his son
to the mountains, and then on a trip to the lake after leaving the
.camp, is admitted to be false. But they did once go together to a
town called Champaign (generally pronounced Shampane, and so
pronounced, according to the stepmother, by Mr. Hyslop, senior,
though Professor Hyslop thinks he called it Campane). After this they
went to Chicago, and naturally visited the lake shore whilst in the city.
Professor Hyslop then suggests a possible reconstruction of the
statement, as follows :
Mr. Hyslop, senior, is supposed to be dictating to Rector, who is
writing through Mrs. Piper's hand (p. 409) :
" I am thinking of the time some years ago when I went into [Father says
'Illinois.' Rector does not understand this, and asks if he means 'hilly.'
Father says, ' no ! prairies.i Rector does not understand. Father says, ' no
mountains.' Rector understands this as 'No! Mountains,' and continues]
the mountains for a change with him, and the trip we had to the lake after
we left [Father says, 'Champaign.' Rector understands 'camp,' and con
tinues] the camp." The name of the town is usually pronounced Shampane,
and according to my stepmother my father so pronounced it when living,
though my own recollection is that he often pronounced it Campane.
The following are a few more instances of the same method : On p.
384 the spirit being asked what medicine he used to take besides
strychnine and Hyomei, replies morphine. Mr. Hyslop, senior, did
not apparently take morphine, but he did take arsenic. "Now this
arsenic is not morphine, but it is a poison that was very closely
associated in father's mind when living with the common class of
poisons, and it might be a natural mistake to make here in men
tioning it instead of arsenic " (p. 410).
Again (p. 386) the spirit is asked if he remembers Samuel Cooper.
The reply is that he was an old friend in the West, and that they used
to have long talks on philosophical subjects. Of Samuel Cooper, an old
neighbour of Mr. Hyslop's, the statement is false. But there was
(p. 411) a Dr. Joseph Cooper, with whom Mr. Hyslop may have
corresponded on theological matters in 1858. It is true that Joseph
is not the same name as Samuel, that the correspondence is purely
conjectural, that in any case writing is not the same as talking, and
that theology is not precisely philosophy, also, that Dr. Cooper did
not live West of Mr. Hyslop, but, unfortunately, East. There was,
however, a Cooper Memorial College, which was founded after his
death, of which Mr. Hyslop may have been thinking ; or the mention
of talk on philosophy may have been intended to refer to Dr. Cooper's
XLV.] Professor Hyslop's Report on Sittings with Mrs. Piper. 387
correspondence on theology with Professor Hyslop's uncle. " The
misunderstanding would probably be Rector's " (p. 500). On the whole
Professor Hyslop thinks that the incident " has considerable interest
and importance" (p. 410).
Once more, after referring to friendly discussion and correspondence
with Cooper, the spirit continues (p. 397) : "I had also several tokens
(1 the word is apparently not legible), which I recollect well. One
was a photo, to which I referred when James was present. . . ." No
photograph can apparently be traced of either Samuel Cooper or
Joseph Cooper. But Professor Hyslop finds much significance in the
allusion to the " tokens." For his explanation of the term, which is
too long and involved to quote, see pp. 411-2.
Or, again, take this statement. The spirit says (p. 397): "Do you
remember the stick I used to carry with the turn in the end, on which
I carved my initials ? If so, what have you done with it ? They are
in the end—with the turn—TURN, he says."
To a plain man this is a very clear and definite description of a stick
with a curved handle, having the owner's initials carved by himself on
the curved part of the handle. Now Mr. Hyslop, senior, did at one
time possess a stick with his initials carved upon it, not apparently by
himself; but the stick was straight. Further, he had possessed at
least two sticks with curved handles, but on neither were his initials
carved. But one of the latter sticks had been given to Mr. Hyslop by
his brother-in-law, who had been responsible for the loss of the straight,
initial-bearing stick.
" If, then, the sentence had read : ' Do you remember the stick I used to
carry with the turn in the end, which was given me for the one on which
my initials were carved in the end?' it would have expressed the exact
truth very clearly . . . and there would have been no confusion about it "
(p. 415).
It is hardly necessary to give any more instances, or to carry the
analysis further. The reader can compare my summary with the
detailed statements in the appendices, and see for himself whether
I have perverted the facts. He can also, with very little trouble,
satisfy himself that the samples which I have chosen for analysis have
not been chosen unfairly. No doubt the last series of sittings, held in
May and June, 1899, show a decidedly smaller proportion of incorrect
statements, and a larger amount of coherent and relevant matter. But
this was of course inevitable, if the trance-intelligence knew how to
profit by its own previous mistakes, and to utilise information gained
from the sitter at previous seances. Moreover, we are hardly entitled
388 Frank Podmore. [PART
to assume, as Professor Hyslop does apparently assume, that the
medium did not make use of external sources of information.
The conclusion reached some years since by Dr. Hodgson and most
other persons who have studied the previous evidence—that Mrs.
Piper, as a matter of fact, did not derive the information uttered in her
trances from such sources as private enquiry agencies—rests primarily
on the consideration that the actual conditions under which the seances
were held would have rendered such fraud useless or impossible. It
did not rest, and ought not to rest, on any one's conviction of the
honesty of the medium. The whole history of spiritualism and psychical
research should convince us that we are never entitled to assume the
honesty of the medium. We know at once too much and too little of
mediumship. Too much, for we know that almost every type of
mediumship has been connected with dishonesty in the past ; too
little, for if there are honest mediums we don't know by what signs to
distinguish them from the dishonest ones. I take it as axiomatic
then that if any information was given at these later seances which
could, in the interval of five months and a half which had elapsed
between the first seance of the first series and the last of this later series,
have been obtained by any fairly intelligent person,—whether from
registers, tombstones, old newspapers, directories, or any other sources,
—this information is to be attributed to such sources. That so
little real information was given goes to show that at any rate the
medium was not an adept in making enquiries. But there is one
incident—the curious confusion between the identity of John
M'CIellan, father of one of the communicating spirits, and another
person of the same name coming from the same part of the country,
to whom reference is made in a county history—which might be
held to point to an unsuccessful attempt of the kind. Professor
Hyslop considers the passage in which this suspicious mistake is
made as " one of the finest sets of pertinent and evidential incidents
in the record" (pp. Ill, 470, 535).
Psychologists tell us that in perceptive processes inadequate and
ambiguous stimuli are peculiarly apt to give rise to hallucination ; or,
in other words, faint sights and sounds are liable to be interpreted
according to the wishes or beliefs of the percipient : and the same
law appears to hold good when we are dealing not with sensations but
with ideas. History supplies us with abundant examples of elaborate
theories constructed out of material sufficiently vague and indeter
minate to allow wide latitude of interpretation.

REVIEWS.
Modern Spiritualism: a History and a Criticism. By FRANK PODMORE.
2 Vols. 8vo. (Methuen & Co., London, 1902.)
Apart from the Proceedings themselves, this book may fairly be described
as the most important contribution to the subject of psychical research that
has—up to the end of 1902—appeared since the publication of Phantasms
of the Living. If a long and profound study of the subject and a wide
acquaintance with cognate subjects, an accurate knowledge of facts and a
philosophic grasp of principles, a strict and impartial adherence to scientific
method regardless of whether or not it leads to distasteful conclusions,—if
these are the qualities requisite for dealing with this topic, it would be
hard to find any living writer better fitted than Mr. Podmore for the
work.
Apart from the desirability of having the whole history in a single
compact form, with the most copious and exact references to the original
authorities, we had reached a stage at which a critical summary of
the results so far attained was urgently needed, and it is fortunate indeed
that both tasks have fallen into such competent hands. It may be
added that the book is written in a clear, concise and crisp style, which
makes it easy and pleasant to read.
The author thus describes his object in writing it (Vol. I., p. xi) : " The
system of beliefs known as Modern Spiritualism—a system which in one
aspect is a religious faith, in another claims to represent a new department
of natural science—is based on the interpretation of certain obscure
facts as indicating the agency of the spirits of dead men and women.
The primary aim of the present work is to provide the necessary data
for determining how far, if at all, that interpretation is justified. But
the question, Is the belief justified 1 cannot, as the whole history of
mysticism stands to prove, be finally answered until we are prepared
with a more or less adequate answer to two subsidiary questions : first,
If not justified, what is the true interpretation of the facts : and, second,
How can the origin and persistence of the false interpretation be
explained 1"
20
390 Alice Johnson. [PART
To answer these questions, we have to take account of the history
of the movement and of the prior systems of belief from which it sprang.
The persistent neglect of the evidence by its opponents seems to have
been due to their belief that the movement would die out of itself ; and
ten years ago these expectations appeared on the way to fulfilment ;
but within the last decade the strongest evidence ever adduced for the
belief in communion with the dead has been furnished through Mrs.
Piper, while the physical manifestations occurring in the presence of
Eusapia Paladino have strongly impressed more than one eminent man
of science.
" Whether the belief in the intercourse with spirits is well founded"
or not, it is certain (says Mr. Podmore, Vol. I., p. xiii) that no critic
has yet succeeded in demonstrating the inadequacy of the evidence upon
which the Spiritualists rely. That evidence groups itself into two distinct
categories ; and in some cases those who accept the one category reject
wholly or in part facts coming under the other. In the first place we have
to consider certain subconscious activities mauifesting themselves in trance
speaking, automatic writing, seeing of visions, which though they may be
readily counterfeited, are not necessarily, or in typical cases, associated with
imposture. In the second place, second in the historical as in the logical
order, there are certain physical manifestations, unquestionably, in their
later developments, bearing strong resemblance to conjuring tricks, but
as unquestionably appearing in the first instance in the presence and
through the agency of uneducated and unskilled persons, mostly young
children, and in circumstances where the hypothesis of trickery presents
formidable moral as well as physical difficulties."
To the man in the street, " spiritualism " generally connotes the " physical
phenomena " only ; and though to students of psychical research the
mental phenomena are at least equally familiar, Mr. Podmore's analysis
of the development of the two classes is not only original, but highly
instructive.
He points out that the physical phenomena are of comparatively recent
origin. With the exception of the single well-defined Poltergeist type,
there is—broadly speaking—no parallel to be found for them in civilised
countries during the last three or four centuries at least.i On the other
hand the mental manifestations—inspired writing and speaking, spiritual
healing, telepathy and clairvoyance—may be derived directly through the
phenomena of Animal Magnetism back to those of ecstasy, obsession,
magic and witchcraft. Thus it appears that this type stretches back in
a series that has probably never been broken to the dawn of human
history,—showing so far no tendency to disappear with the advance of
civilisation,—while the former species has only occurred sporadically—
iMrs. Sidgwiok points out in her article on "Spiritualism" in the
Britannica that a practice of causing heavily-loaded tables to rise by "magic" seems
to have existed among the German Jews in the 17th oentury. See Von Hut-less,
Atgyptisci< Mystcrien, 1866, pp. 130-132.
XLV.] Beview, 391
as a sort of adventitious or parasitic aftergrowth, attached here and there
to the main organism of belief, but at no time forming an integral part
of it.
" For the proper understanding of the subject it is essential to note
(Vol. I., p. xiv) that the recognition of the trance phenomena, as testifying
to the existence of a spiritual world, preceded the acceptance of the physical
manifestations as signs and wonders vouchsafed from that world. The
raps and movements of tables did not, in the ultimate analysis, originate
anything ; they served merely to confirm a pre-existing belief. It is, no
doubt, amongst other causes, primarily because of the failure to recognise
this historical sequence that most attempts to demonstrate the falsity
of the Spiritualist belief have proved ineffectual. It was of little use
for the American doctors to prove that the raps could be produced by
cracking of the joints, or Faraday that tables could be turned by un
conscious muscular action alone ; for Maskelyne to imitate the rope-tying
feats of the Davenport Brothers ; or for hardy investigators at a later
date to seize the spirit form at a dark stance. Alike in the larger historical
cycle and in the sequence of each individual experience, the faith in
Spiritualism was buttressed by these things, not based on them ; and
though shaken, could not be permanently overthrown by any demonstration
of their futility."
The subject divides itself into three main topics, which we may take in
order : (1) the history of the movement, (2) the so-called physical
.phenomena, (3) the mental manifestations.
I. THE HISTORY or THE MOVEMENT.
Mr. Podmore shows that Spiritualism is historically the direct outgrowth
of Animal Magnetism, starting, e.g., in America from the revelations
of a magnetic clairvoyant, Andrew Jackson Davis—the " Poughkeepsie
Seer," and its first exponents being drawn from the ranks of those who
had studied and practised Animal Magnetism. The spiritualistic inter
pretation of the trance had also been widely adopted in Europe long
before 1848, the year of (among other things) the famous rappings. For
a proper understanding of the subject of Spiritualism, then, it becomes
necessary to study the earlier mystical beliefs and especially the cult of
Animal Magnetism in America and Europe. Until recently those who
paid any attention to this cult were divided into two fiercely opposed
camps—one believing devoutly not only in the phenomena but in the
most fantastic explanations of them, especially the operation of a subtle
fluid ; while the other rejected them wholesale, as the results at least of
mal-observation, if not of fraud. The two eminent men of science,
Bertraud and Braid, who accepted the phenomena while attempting to
relate them to known physiological laws, entirely failed to gain the ear
of their scientific contemporaries, and were treated with even more con
tumely by believers than by sceptics. "Nature, it may be said, (observes
392 Alice Johnson. [PART
Mr. Podmore) abhors a Mugwump." Let us hope that the S.P.R. will never
be led to stultify its work through sharing in the same prejudice !
In the case of hypnotism, posterity came round after all to the side of
the Mugwumps, finding in their views a rationalistic explanation of facts
which it was no longer possible to ignore ; and Mr. Podmore suggests
that the modern doctrine of telepathy may similarly be found to furnish
a rationalistic explanation of many facts which have been attributed to
spiritual agencies. Headers of the Proceedings will be aware that the same
view was maintained by Mr. Myers in his articles on automatic writing,
although, of course, Mr. Podmore is inclined to press the explanation much
further than Mr. Myers did.
His work is divided into four books : I. The Pedigree of Spiritualism ;
II. Early American Spiritualism ; III. Spiritualism in England ; IV.
Problems of Mediumship. In Book I., Possession and Witchcraft are
first treated of, with accounts of many historical cases of " speaking with
tongues" (a topic which recurs in connection with various clairvoyants and
later trance mediums) : the Nuns of Loudun, the Tremblers of the Cevennes,
the Convulsionaries of St. Medard and the Irvingites. Witchcraft has
often : been taken as a text to show the folly of human beliefs and the
unreliability of human testimony. In Phantasms of the Living Gurney
had already pointed out that, as a matter of fact, the evidence for witch
craft was very poor, consisting to a large extent of inferences rather
than observations, while the observations were either those of children
and uneducated persons, or reported at second-hand. To this Mr.
Podmore adds an instructive comparison of the earlier witchcraft to the
later Poltergeist phenomena. In both cases it is almost always children
or uneducated persons who are concerned. There is much, again, in witch
craft which is now understood to be due to hysteria and suggestion,
affecting both the bystanders and agents or victims, and Mr. Podmore
gives reasons for supposing that the similar Poltergeist effects are attribut
able to similar causes.
It is important to note that the general argument depends for its
cogency on the assumption— an assumption amply borne out by the whole
history of " physical phenomena "—that the things described were not the
things that occurred, but only what the witnesses—sooner or later, but
generally later—believed to have occurred. Not that this assumption is
taken by the writer for granted ; but that detailed comparisons of
contemporary with later, and first-hand with second-hand, evidence show
it to be necessary. The principle has long been accepted—theoretically—
by the S.P.R., and we lose nothing by seeing it applied now and then
with relentless logic.
An interesting confirmation of Mr. Podmore's explanation of Poltergeists
is to be found in a case given above (p. 320) by Mr. Lang, in which
Poltergeist phenomena were produced by a servant girl in consequence—
apparently—of a prediction made to her by a witch, which seems to have
acted as a suggestion. The special interest of this case is that the girl
XLV.] . Review. 393
appears to have acted automatically, without intention and perhaps
unconsciously. ;
We may find in the future that a good many cases of "physical
phenomena" may be similarly explained. See e.g. a case reported by
Professor Janet in the Bulletin de I'Institut Psychologique International
(December, 1901) and referred to by Mr. Podmore (Vol. II., p. 325).
The next part of the book treats of the rise and progress of " animal
magnetism " before and after Mesmer, its spread in different countries
and the various theories as to some kind of force, generally conceived of
as a fluid, to which the effects were attributed ; the early observations of
the trance by Puysegur ; the so-called transpositions of the senses described
by P6t6tin ; the occasional instances of what appeared to be clairvoyance
or thought-transference observed by some of the most scientific investi
gators ; the growth of the trance-phenomena* which gradually came more
and more, partly through the influence of Swedenburg, to be attributed
to the control of spirits—especially in Sweden, France, and Germany ;
the German somnambules, with their visions of heaven and their crude
mystical, or rather material, theories of the universe ; the comparatively
Lite introduction of mesmerism into England, where the interest roused
in it was keen indeed, but limited, its opponents being even more violent
than its supporters, and where the Spiritistic interpretation of the trance
found little favour ;—of all these things a valuable historical account is
given, with full references to the original sources.
. What chiefly strikes one is the hurry that these observers were in to come
to conclusions, and find explanations—or even to found complete theories of
life on what they had witnessed. They had, indeed, abundance of facts
iefore them—facts even which, unlike many of those with which
psychical research has to deal, could be repeated at will. It' was easy
enough to induce visions, to obtain trance utterances, to produce—in
well-trained subjects—" transpositions of the senses " and " phrenological "
phenomena, specific reactions to metals and magnets, and so on. But, as
we know, the experimenters generally failed to grasp one important prin
ciple,—the efficacy of suggestion; and for want of this much of their work
is useless. Now, as Dr. Bramwell remarks (Proceedings, Vol. XII., p. 224)
and as Mr. Myers especially insists upon (Human Personality, Chapter V.),
"suggestion" is not an explanation, but merely a formula (like many Other
so-called explanations) ; but it is now recognised to be a formula in
dispensable to any rational interpretation of hypnotism. The history
of animal magnetism shows usr then, the imperative necessity of sus
pending our judgment on a science still in , ,so rudimentary a stage as
psychical research, lest we, too, should be wandering uselessly iii a
labyrinth, and shutting our eyes all the time to some clue which may be
lying close at our feet. , • ' ,
Early records of clairvoyance and thought-transference are next treated

will probably agree with Mr. Podmore in thinking it inconclusive. The
experimenters, as a rule, made little or no allowance for hypersesthesi*
and heightened intelligence in the trance, or for subconscious interpreta
tions by their subjects of slight indications unconsciously given by
themselves. The possibilities of codes and of conjuring were not taken
much account of, and the records generally were kept with little care.
There remain, however, a certain number of good cases, to which weight
may fairly be allowed, since they have been reinforced later by evidence
more up to modern requirements. Among these, Mr. Podmore gives a
prominent place to the remarkable trance utterances of Cahagnet's subject,
Adcle Maginot (already described in his article in Proceedings, Vol. XIV.,
p. 50), the only one of the early sensitives whom he thinks worthy to
be compared with Mrs. Piper.
He passes on next to the early cult of mesmerism in America. Here
the subject was chiefly taken up by persons of little or no scientific
education, with the result that the more extravagant theories of phrenology
and nerve-fluids were carried to great extremes and set forth in barbar
ous systems of nomenclature.
The mesmerised subjects soon developed into trance mediums, of whom
Andrew Jacksoii Davis, the Poughkeepsie seer, was the most famous. Hia
" Harmonial Philosophy " was expounded in a series of lectures given
during trance, and afterwards published. These "Revelations" deal with
the evolution of the universe,—or, as Davis preferred to call it, the
Univercoelum,—and show a curious mixture of arrogance and ignorance.
Mr. Podmore gives a few instances of the " scientific " statements made
—e.g. the description of the ichthyosaurus inhaling through an adipose
branches (sir) an atmosphere which consisted of carbon, nearly counter
balanced by oxygen. Of his philosophy, we are not after this surprised
to hear that its meaning is " elusive beyond the tolerated usage of
philosophers." Yet his work shows traces of certain qualities which n>ay
partly account for the extraordinary popularity it achieved. He had
clearly been much influenced by Fourierism a7id Swedenborgianism ; he
had realised " something of the orderly progression from the primaeval
fire mist ; something of the unity in complexity of the monstrous world ;
something, too, of the social needs of his time and of ours—the waste,
the injustice, the manifold futilities and absurdities involved in the present
stage of economic evolution. . . . He could appreciate the bigness of
the ideas with which he dealt, and in a semi-articulate, barbarous fashion,
could make other people appreciate them too."
But his fame is chiefly to be attributed to the "Rochester knockings,"
which formed the next epoch in the movement, and were regarded by
Davis and his followers as the fulfilment of his prophecy of freer spirit-
intercourse with earth.
The history of the originators of these knockings—the Fox sisters—and
their host of followers and imitators, given in full in Book II., needs no
special comment here. Copious extracts are given from original sources.
XLV.] Review. 395
of the best evidence for the "physical phenomena" produced by these
mediums ; and it is shown how far that evidence falls short of what is
required. " To the reader of to-day " (says Mr. Podmore, Vol. I., p. 249,
and few would probably be prepared to contradict the assertion) " the
mere statement of such belief on such grounds may well appear preposter
ous. Logical grounds for the belief—as logic is understood in the modern
world—were clearly wanting. But the matter should not on that account
be summarily dismissed as a pale recrudescence of mediaeval superstition.
For which of us is in better case ? The causes of belief in the last
analysis are not logical. It should not be overlooked that, in the present
instance, the men who believed, if not of high intellectual distinction, had
at least proved themselves capable, and had won more or less reputation
amongst their fellow-citizens as merchants, preachers, university pro
fessors, physicians, lawyers, legislators, and men of science ; that many of
them had embraced such belief when still in the prime of life and the
ripeness of their judgment ; that the same beliefs are held by a large
number of persons, even at the present day. We may feel assured that
in one form or another the belief in such marvels, as it has revived again
and again in the past, will manifest itself again and again in generations
to come ; and history shows that those who sneer at such credulity with
out attempting to understand its causes, are perhaps themselves not the
least likely to fall victims, precisely because they do not understand."
As an aid to such understanding, the author gives a graphic account
of the American milieu, in which the cult first grew and flourished (Vol.
L, p. 208, et teq.). "It was in the conditions of a new and rapidly
expanding civilisation, and perhaps in the special genius of the American
people, that the explanation must be sought. . . . We find a nation
in whom the standard of popular education and intelligence was much
higher than in England, and probably most other European countries at
the same date. But this very diffusion of education was in some aspects
mischievous. In the older civilisations the world of ideas is still an
oligarchy, with a constitution to some extent fixed and defined. There
are recognised standards and precedents for the guidance of thought in
every department. But in the American Republic of fifty years ago, every
man claimed the right to think for himself, and to think as extravagantly
and inconsequently as he chose. . . . Speculation [had] a freedom which
would have been impossible in a more settled society. . . . Outside the
few large cities [there was] an immense fringe of semi-rural ' townships,'
carved out of the wilderness but yesterday, and filled with an enthusiastic
horde of pioneers, who had learned to read and to think from men, or as
we have just seen, from children, 1 scarcely better trained and equipped
than themselves. . . . There was inevitably expended on the problems of
life a large amount of vigorous but crude and undisciplined thinking ; and
i The Rev. J. 6. Ferguson, a prominent spiritualist of the time, at the age of thirteen
conducted a school at one end of a log house ; a shoemaker, who worked at his trade
at the other end, holding himself in readiness to help in keeping order.
396 Alice Johnson. [PART
the results stand on record now in the history of various American religious
epidemics, of American Socialisms, of American phrenology, of crusades
against alcohol, tobacco, pork," etc. Socialism especially seems, to have
been most intimately bound up with spiritualism. What was attractive in
the new creed was its humanitarian and religious side, its appeal to the
liberal instinct in all departments of thought and feeling, its claim to
provide men with a satisfying solution of the most vital problems. " The
strong impulse (Vol. I., p. 225) which transformed the tricks of mischievous
children .... into the beginnings of a new gospel of hope and freedom
proceeded from men like Warren Chase and John Murray Spear, full of
crude but sincere aspirations for the bettering of the world ; men whose
eyes were often blinded by the very splendour of their distant ideals to
all that was sordid and contemptible in the present. There were many
men of the same type who were at that very time labouring for the
abolition of negro slavery. . . . Many of [these Spiritualists] shared
with the Socialists and reformers their large enthusiasms and their
generous incapacity to see the trickeries and mean egotisms which sur
rounded them."
. The follies and extravagances associated with the movement were
indeed obvious enough, as may be seen from the instances given by Mr.
•Podmore. But he is careful to point out—and this is what makes his
history of value—that all these absurdities were mere excrescences on
the movement, and not an essential part of it. The main body of
.Spiritualists repudiated them, and though they received the physical pheno
mena credulously enough, they regarded them chiefly as signs—not as
evidences—of a spiritual force. It was on the mental phenomena that they
relied,—the indications .of intelligence in the raps ; the trance-utterances
and visions ; the doctrines that in many respects harmonised with their
previous beliefs, and at their best had nothing positively repugnant to
ordinary common-sense. " The special characteristi<: of the Spiritualist
movement from the beginning has been its democratic character. There
has been neither recognised leader nor authoritative statement of creed.
This characteristic again gave breadth, tolerance, and expansiveneas to
the movement, which made it unique among religious revivals, and
rendered it possible for the new belief to combine with almost any pre
existing system of doctrine" (Vol. I., p.. 299).
This too great .elasticity and plasticity—this " anaemic optimism "—had,
'however, its drawbacks. The philosophy and religion of that early school
of Spiritualism cannot appeal to cultivated thinkers of to-day. The
philosophy is essentially materialistic, and the religion essentially parochial.
" The world [which the spirits] present to our view (Vol. I., p. 302) is
a strictly material world, developing by processes .of .material evolution
towards an unknown end. There is no mystery about their teaching.
Spirit is only attenuated matter ; the other world a counterpart of this ;
the living universe an endless series of beings like ourselves. Their view
in short represents the product of common-sense, the comiuou-seuse of
XLV.] Review: 397
the ordinary uninstructed man. . . . There is rarely any hint of deeper
insight. The problems of Space and Time, of Knowing and Being, of
Evil and Good, of Will and Law, are .hardly even recognised. Common-
sense is not competent for these questions ; and in so far as the Spiritualist
scheme fails to take account of them, it falls short of being a Theology,
or even an adequate Cosmology. But such as it is, though it makes no
appeal to the higher imagination, and ignores the deeper mysteries of
life, it has for nearly two generations satisfied .the intellectual needs and
the emotional cravings of hundreds of thousands of votaries. And its
followers can boast that"—they have the qualities of their defects—
" throughout that period they have shown a sympathy for opinions
differing from their own, and a tolerance for their opponents, unique in
the history of sects called religious."
In 1852 the new ideas first penetrated into England through the visit
of an American medium, Mrs. Hayden. Up to that time, such "clair
voyance " as had been found associated with the mesmeric trance had
not as a rule received the Spiritualistic interpretation. An epidemic
of table-turning now set in, answers to questions being obtained by
tilts or by raps at particular letters as the questioner ran his finger
along an alphabet. The results were received with much greater scepticism
in England than they had been in America. G. H. Lewes, e.g., showed
how he could get any answer he wished for through the medium's
observation of the way he hesitated at the appropriate letters, and others
noticed that she could only succeed when the alphabet was in her view.
Braid again, and afterwards Faraday, proved that the table might be
moved with entire unconsciousness on the part of the agents. The English
mesmerists in general, however, adopted table-turning with enthusiasm,
finding in the supposed vital or " electro-odycal " force that produced it
a confirmation of their theories of Animal Magnetism. On the other
hand the practice was violently attacked by a group of Evangelical
clergy, who attributed the movements to Satanic agency.
II. THE SO-CALLED PHYSICAL PHENOMENA.
At this period the " physical phenomena " exhibited by most mediums
were sporadic and simple — raps, spirit-lights, and a rudimentary form
of slate-writing, as practised by Miss Marshall. The rapid growth of
spiritualism is to be attributed rather to the extraordinary outburst of
automatic activity—visions, trance-speaking, writing and drawing—that
next took place, and which excited much more interest in its adherents.
The literature of the time is chiefly concerned with these, and the physical
.phenomena are generally passed over with such remarks as that of Mrs.
de Morgan that " instances of tables rising from the floor to the height
of three or four feet are so well attested" that it is hardly necessary
.to refer to them.
•. In 1860, however, the movement entered upon a new phase, in
398 Alice Johnson. [PART
consequence of what Mr. Podmore describes as the American Invasion,—
the visit of a long succession of American mediums, the most prominent
of whom was Home, to England. Professional mediumship had now
become highly developed, and the physical phenomena were much more
complicated and varied than before. Descriptions are given of typical
performances of the principal mediums of this period, and of the successful
imitation of many of them by conjurers ; also of many exposures and
discoveries of fraud. Mr. Podmore of course fully admits that to prove
trickery in some cases is not to prove it in all, and that it is conceivable
that a medium might sometimes cheat and at other times produce genuine
phenomena ; but he contends that, apart from the evidence presented
by Home's seances, no presumption of a new physical agency is established
by the records of these mediums.
With regard to the general method of dealing with evidence on all
these subjects—the mental as well as the physical phenomena—one diffi
culty is that the accounts are always more or less ambiguous, because the
recorder unconsciously assumes in the reader a certain degree of familiarity
with the circumstances. Any one who has made a serious attempt to
give a really accurate description of a complicated event will know how
difficult it is to avoid using some expression which may legitimately
be misinterpreted by a reader. And the witnesses here dealt with are
often little practised either in observing or describing. The question
then constantly arises : when a passage or an event is susceptible of
two or more interpretations, which ought we to take ?
When this question arises in the course of a scientific research into
any alleged new fact or principle, the authenticity of which is disputed,
every one agrees that we should invariably take the less favourable
interpretation,—that the burden of proof lies throughout on those who
attempt to establish the new fact or principle.
It is because psychical research is hardly yet recognised as a branch
of science—even by psychical researchers—that this method is so
grudgingly admitted in its case. People cannot get away from the idea
that we are investigating the characters of the witnesses rather than
the events occurring in their presence. Of course the character of the
witness is one factor in the evidence ; and if our primary object were
to determine whether a witness or a medium was an honest person, it
would not be out of place to exercise charity of judgment. But the
question of the probity of witnesses is here a purely secondary one, and
concerns us merely as bearing on the question of the authenticity of
the facts. In judging the latter, it cannot be too strongly insisted on
that we are bound always to take the most unfavourable interpretation.
Mr. Podmore has faithfully followed this principle, with the result
that his book is an admirable example of scientific method, and will
no doubt be fiercely attacked on that score.
It must further be admitted that in his lighter moments he sometimes
allows himself to indulge in humorous gibes, which add to the literary
XLV.] Review. 399
form of the narrative, but are hardly calculated to conciliate opponents.
His more serious utterances, however, show no lack of sympathy or
respect for those who differ from him in opinion ; for instance, his
description of the early American spiritualists, some part of which has
already been quoted, and the following passage in reference to the physical
phenomena :
(Vol. II., p. 141) "The dealings of science with spiritualism form
an instructive chapter in the history of human thought. Not the least
instructive feature of the chronicle is the sharp contrast between
the tone and temper of those men of science who, after examination,
accepted, and of those who, with or without examination, rejected the
evidence for the alleged physical phenomena. Those who held themselves
justified in believing in a new physical force—for De Morgan, Crookes,
and other scientific converts did not at the outset, nor in some cases at
all, adopt the Spiritualist belief proper—showed in their writings a
modesty, candour, and freedom from prepossession, which shine the more
conspicuously by comparison with the blustering arrogance of some of the
self-constituted champions of scientific orthodoxy."
After a most careful examination of the subject, however, he comes to
the conclusion (Vol. II., p. 182) that "generally, the strongest evidence
yet considered for the genuineness of any of these manifestations falls far
short of the standard of proof which is required before any such claim
can be admitted." He brings forward two general objections to the accept
ance of the marvels. (1) If the physical effects claimed to have been
produced are not due to known physical causes, we have to assume not
one new force capable of acting upon matter, but several, because the
effects are of so many different kinds.
This, of course, is a merely a priori objection, and as such is liable to
be upset by further discoveries. Readers who are interested in the
question may be referred to an extremely ingenious speculation in Mr.
Myers's Human Personality, Vol. II., pp. 530-543, as to how a force or
entity, analogous to Clerk Maxwell's Demons in the power of dealing
with molecules as we deal with masses of matter, might produce many
of the alleged kinds of phenomena.
Yet (adds Mr. Myers, op. cit. p. 543) "it is to 'will power' that the
communicating spirits themselves ascribe their achievements ; to some
mode of operation quite unexplained, but even more direct, more funda
mental, than those imagined molecular powers which I cited to show how
men who believed that no ' demon ' existed, found it necessary to invent
one."
(2) Mr. Podmore's second objection is much more serious, since it relates
to the nature of the actual facts. " It is briefly this : The annals of
Spiritualism offer no physical phenomena which do not, in the last
analysis, depend on the experimenter's unaided senses for their observa
tion, and on his memory for their record." Sir William Crookes at
the outset of his researches laid down certain rules to which he thought
400 Alice Johnson. [PART
scientific proof of a new physical force should conform (see his
Researches in the Phenomena of Spiritualism pp. 6-7) viz., that the effect*
produced should not depend for their evidence on simple observation,
but should be capable of being registered by scientific instruments, and
measured and tested by scientific tests, so contrived as to be proof
against fraudulent manipulati°n ; e.g. the passage of an object into a
hermetically sealed tube.
The experiments which come nearest to satisfying these conditions
are, no doubt, those of Sir William Crookes himself with Home,
especially the experiments in the alteration in weight of a board. In
these experiments, one end of the board rested on a table and the other
was supported by a spring balance. Home placed his fingers on the end
on the table and " willed " the board to become heavier or lighter ; the
variations in weight being recorded by an automatic register. Mr.
Podmore suggests that the effect might possibly have been produced
by the use of a dark thread with a loop attached to some part of the
apparatus—-perhaps the hook of the spring balance—and the ends
fastened, say, to the knees of Home's trousers (he gives instances of
tricks performed by similar means). We can only say that the possibility
of this particular trick does not seem to have occurred to the experi
menters (of course not even a conjurer can be expected to be familiar
with all possible conjuring tricks), and that the conditions of the seances,
at described, do not exclude it. A similar explanation is suggested for
the movements of a lath and some other small objects at the seances.
But to suggest a possible explanation of an event is not to prove that
it occurred in the way suggested, and Mr. Podmore adds (Vol. II., p.
243) : " It is not easy to see how the investigators . . . could have
been deceived, and repeatedly deceived, by any device of the kind
suggested ; and if we find ourselves unable to accept Mr. Crookes'
testimony, we are guided to an adverse decision less perhaps by any
defects which have been demonstrated in the particular evidence here
presented than by that general presumption against the operation of
the supposed new physical energy which . . . inevitably follows from
an analysis of all the cognate evidence accumulated down to the present
day." The evidence for Sir W. Crookes' experiments may not be perfect,
but it is undoubtedly very good. If there were plenty of other evidence
of the same kind as good, the cumulative effect would be great indeed.
It is really because the good evidence is so slender in amount that
cautious persons may hesitate to build on it.
The evidence for Home's phenomena is poor enough apart from that
of Sir W. Crookes. It must be remembered that he had been practising
as a medium for some twenty years before these sittings, and though
he was never actually exposed, his sitters generally seem to have
imposed no tests on him, and there are many circumstances in the
reports which point to some kind of trickery. The reports, e.g., of his
levitations (see Vol. I., p. 244, and Vol. II., pp. 253-4) suggest that he
XLV.] . Review. 401
was trying to deceive his sitters in the dark by making them think that
he was floating in the air when he was really supported by normal means.
There is also evidence that illusions, and even hallucinations (see Vol. II.,
p. 268), were fairly frequent at his seances, and as Mr. Podmore says,
this may account for many alleged phenomena.
The objection generally offered to this explanation is based on the
supposition that it implies some kind of hypnotic or abnormal condition
on the part of the hallucinated sitter, whereas sitters as a rule remaiu
in a normal condition throughout a seance. But hallucinations are often
experienced in a normal condition ; just as suggestions are often success-
folly imposed by medical hypnotists on patients in a normal waking
state : and it seems possible that part of a successful medium's equipment
depends on a similar unexplained power of influencing people in an
unusual way,—something that transcends the skill of a conjurer much
as the hypnotist's power of suggestion transcends that of the ordinary
doctor.
Besides the instances given in the text of an apparent power of this,
kind, we may refer to a remarkable account published by Dr. Gibotteau
in the Annales des Sciences Piychiquet (Sept.-Oct. and Nov.-Dec., 1892)
of hallucinations imposed—perhaps telepathically and certainly without
verbal suggestions—on himself and one of his friends by a peasant
woman, the daughter of a reputed witch.
The section on physical phenomena concludes with two of the most
interesting chapters in the book, entitled "Automatism" and "Dream
Consciousness," containing an analysis of the natural history of mediums
from the psychological point of view. " It would betray " (says the author,
Vol. II., p. 289) "a very inadequate conception of the nature of the
movement to dismiss it as merely one more instance of the exploitation
of fools by knaves. That many so-called mediums have been knaves of
a commonplace type there can of course be little question. . . . But
the typical mediums, the men or women who have risen to eminence in
their profession, would not come under any such familiar formula. If
knaves, they seem at any rate to have shared in the folly of their dupes.
It is no doubt in this fact that the secret of their power lay. The medium
succeeded in deceiving others because, wholly or partially, he at the same
time deceived himself ; and he deceived himself because, as a rule, he
was not fully aware of what he was doing." This thesis is defended with a
profundity of knowledge and a wide and philosophic insight into human
nature ; but it is impossible to do justice to it in the limits of a
review.
III. THE MENTAL MANIFESTATIONS.
But, as already indicated, however conclusively it may be proved that
the so-called physical phenomena afford no evidence of the action of any
physical force beyond that exerted by the human muscles, Mr. Podmore
maintains that the strength of the argument for spiritism remains
402 Alice Johnson. [PART
unaffected, for this really depends on the evidence for supernormal mental
powers, as manifested in numerous cases, and pre-eminently in the case of
Mrs. Piper. Evidence of this kind is on an altogether different footing
from that for the physical phenomena, because it relates to matters much
simpler in themselves—mere utterances or writings, instead of movements
involving an indefinite number of objects besides the medium—and also
because it does not depend on continuous observation of what is going
on at the moment, but may be recorded in such a way as to be per
manently available for study.
Granting that Mrs. Piper has supernormal powers, we come next to the
question whether telepathy from the living is adequate to explain them,
or whether we must invoke telepathy from the dead. It matters not in
the first instance whether the latter kind of telepathy consists merely of
impressions conveyed from the discarnate to the incarnate mind, or
whether it develops into a temporary fusion of the two minds—the dis
carnate one taking the predominant part and governing the organism for
the time, according to Mr. Myers's theory of possession. We have first
to substantiate the agency of the discarnate mind in the matter, before
we need discuss its method of action.
When the case of Mrs. Piper was first discussed, it was generally
recognised that as much as possible should be explained by telepathy
from the living, before invoking other agencies ; and this for two reasons :
(1) the evidence for such telepathy is both good and abundant ; (2) the
evidence for the most obvious other alternative—telepathy from the dead
—cannot, from the nature of the case, so far as we can see at present,
ever be so good, because we only know what takes place at one end of
the telepathic chain, whereas in telepathy from the living we can gain
information as to both ends.
These are obvious—even trite—considerations ; but it is necessary to
repeat them from time to time because controversy on this subject tends
to degenerate into arguing whether telepathy from the living or from the
dead is more probable a priori. The result has been extremely unfortu
nate. Some who advocate telepathy from the dead have so persistently
undervalued telepathy from the living as to have created, apparently, an
impression that we no longer care to have evidence for it. In the
early days of the S.P.R. the great importance of telepathy was better
understood. Mr. Balfour, for instance, in his Presidential address, speaks
of it as "a fact (if fact it be) . . . far more scientifically extraordinary
than would be the destruction of this globe by [collision with some star].
... It is a profound mystery if it be true, or if anything like it be
true ; and no event, however startling, which easily finds its appropriate
niche in the structure of the physical sciences ought to excite half so
much intellectual curiosity as this dull and at first sight commonplace
phenomenon" (Proceedings, Vol. X., pp. 9-10).
Apart from the urgent necessity of learning more about telepathy on
account of its own intrinsic importance, it is, I am inclined to think,
XLV.] Review. 403
along this line that our best chance lies of proving personal immortality.
" Whether or not," says Mr. Podmore, (Vol. II., p. 359) " the conditions of
another world permit its denizens to hold halting communication with
those here is a question of slight and transitory import if we have it in
our power to demonstrate, from its own inherent properties, that the life
of the soul is not bound up with the life of the body." He refers to Mr.
Myers's view that the transcendental powers of the subliminal self afford
evidence of its immortality ; but in one important respect he misconceives
this view,—supposing it to rest on the existence in the subliminal self
of such faculties as prevision, retrocognition, and clairvoyance, for which,
as he rightly says, the evidence is at present scanty. But Mr. Myers
explains clearly and constantly in Human Pertonality (which was not
published when Mr. Podmore wrote) that he regards Telepathy as the
most fundamental and important of all transcendental faculties. For
instance (Vol. I., p. 8), "In the course of this work it will be my task
to show in many connections how far-reaching are the implications of
this direct and supersensory communion of mind with mind. Among
those implications none can be more momentous than the light thrown by
this discovery upon man's intimate nature and possible survival of death."
Again he says (Vol. II., p. 526) that though telepathy cannot actually
prove survival, it strongly suggests it. The question depends primarily on
whether it works through a physical mechanism or not, and Mr. Myers
adduces many considerations tending to show that the process is essentially
mental (see e.g. Vol. I., pp. 245-6, Vol. II., p. 195. The same view is
strongly expressed in Vol. II., p. 282). The apparent unlikeness of tele
pathic action to the action of any known physical force is also insisted
on by Mr. Balfour in his Presidential Address, quoted above (Proceedings,
Vol. X., pp. 10--11).
In any case, it is sufficiently obvious that we have still a great deal to
learn on the subject, and we can all endorse Mr. Podmore's final conclusion
that the question is one of evidence : " The task before us is the patient
analysis of the existing evidence, and the attempt, preferably by direct
experiment, to acquire new evidence on the subject."

The Varietiet of Religiont Experience, A Study in Human Nature, being the

Psychical Research seems at length to be in a fair way of being officially
connected with psychological orthodoxy. For in his latest book, which i.s
sure to be at least as widely read as any of its predecessors, the greatest of
living psychologists assigns so fundamental an importance to the influence of
what the late Frederic Myers called the Subliminal, and uses it so freely and
brilliantly to explain the psychological facts he is describing, that it seems
404 F. C. S. Schiller. [PART
impossible that psychologists will be able to evade much longer the considera
tion either of the conception or of the evidence on which it is based. The
readers of Professor James' exquisite tribute to the late President of the
S.P.R. (Proceedings, Part XLII.) will indeed be familiar with his appreciation
of the subconscious factors in mental life, but even these will probably
experience some surprise at the extensive use made in the present volume
of the group of conceptions with which psychical researchers have attempted
to explore the dark corners of the human mind. Professor James' example
does much to remove two of the chief difficulties with which the S.P.R. has
had to contend in its dealings with academic psychologists, viz: (1) that of
connecting its subjects with the ordinary topics of psychological concern, aud
(2) that of finding employment for its conceptions in normal psychology.
Now it has recently been maintained by the new ' pragmatist ' school of
philosophers that to prove a doctrine useful is the first step towards proving
it true ; it supplies at least a motive for discovering and testing its ' truth,'
and even if it should turn out that it ceases to be useful aud tenable beyond a
certain point, leaves it at least methodologically valuable and true for certain
purposes. Hence it would be hard for us to exaggerate the importance of
Professor James' proof that the doctrine of the subliminal consciousness is
useful for the purpose of describing the phenomena of the religious life.
Which being premised, we may proceed to a more detailed consideration of
the points in Professor James' book which seem specially relevant to the
work of the S.P.R. His aim was, he tells us, an empirical inductive descrip
tion of " man's religious appetites," i.e. of the accounts given of their religious
experiences by a large number of (more or less) literary persons—institu
tional religious, statistics, and the sociological attitude in general beinp
excluded—and within its limits forms an extraordinarily brilliant and
immensely suggestive study of its subject. Even apart from its special
bearing on Psychical Research, I do not know what recent philosophic book
could be more strongly recommended to lovers of good literature.
The first obstacle in his path which Professor James has to clear away is
the objection that his whole subject is entirely morbid and pathological, and
that personal and intimate experiences of religious truth are merely the
results of neurotic diseqxiilibration. In the chapter on "Religion and
Neurology," Professor James gives some delightful specimens of this type of
explanation (p. 10) :
"Alfred believes in immortality so strongly, because his temperament is
so emotional. Fanny's extraordinary conscientiousness is merely a matter of
over- instigated nerves. William's melancholy about the universe is due to a
bad digestion— probably his liver is torpid. Eliza's delight in her church is
a symptom of her hysterical constitution. Peter would be less troubled about
his soul if he would take more exercise in the open-air, etc. A more fully-
developed example of the same kind of reasoning is the fashion, quite com
mon nowadays among certain writers, of criticising the religious emotions by
showing a connection between them and the sexual life. Conversion is a
crisis of puberty and adolescence. The macerations of Saints and the
XLV.] Review. 405
devotion of missionaries are only instances of the parental instinct of self-
sacrifice gone astray. For the hysterical nun starving for natural life Christ
is but an imaginary substitute for a more earthly object of affection.
Medical materialism finishes up Saint Paul by calling his vision on the road
to Damascus a discharging lesion of the occipital cortex, he being an epileptic.
It -••inils out Saint Teresa as a hysteric, Saint Francis of Assisi as a
hereditary degenerate. George Fox's discontent with the shams of his age,
and his pining for spiritual veracity, it treats as a symptom of a disordered
colon. Carlyle's organ-tones of misery it accounts for by a gastro-duodenal
catarrh. . . . And medical materialism then thinks that the spiritual
authority of all such personages is successfully undermined."
To all this the reply is simple. All these methods seek to discredit the
value of a thing by appealing to its origin. But though a suspicious origin
may render us cautious about a thing, it is after all with its value when it
has come about that we are really concerned. A truth discovered when the
blood was at 103° F. would be just as true and valuable as when it was at
98° F., and no one thinks of discrediting the products of the arts or the
natural sciences "by showing up their authors' neurotic constitution."
Whatever occasion a subject may give us to air our prejudices, the last
criterion always is empirical, and r^ests on the way in which a thing works as
a whole. " By their fruits ye shall know them, not by their roots " (p. 20).
The bearing of this lively discussion on the whole subject of ' psychic
powers ' is not far to seek. For one of the chief objections of common sense
to psychic research is the suspicious character of the personnel concerned
with it. Ghost-seers are emotional and imaginative persons whose stories
need not be believed: mediums are neuropathic to the verge of insanity, and
whoever believes in them is a weak-minded ' crank.' Whenever, therefore, a
man of science or intellectual standing exhibits symptoms of interest in such
subjects, it is time to circulate well-constructed tales of his deplorable lapse
from sanity.i
To all this all who are exposed to similar charges may henceforth reply in
Professor James' words. It may be very extensively true that the avowed
" psychics " are persons whose mental (and even moral) health leaves a good
deal to be desired. But then the social atmosphere is at present still more
unfavourable to the cultivation, than to the study, of psychic powers. And
the ignorance which envelopes the subject is still so dense that it needs
unusual courage to take the risks which their cultivation may involve.
Heuce those in whom psychic powers are combined with superior and well-
balanced minds, capable of efficient self-control, will naturally shrink from
cultivating, or at least from divulging them. It will only be in the weaker
minds that these phenomena will burst forth uncontrollably, and add to the
distrust with which such powers have always been regarded. And yet all the
time these powers might really be extremely valuable, and as innocuous,
when properly understood and regulated, as e.g. musical gifts. And
i With hardly an exception all the leailing members of the S.P.K. have, to my
certain knowledge, been subjected to this form of martyrdom.
406 F. C. S. Schiller. [PART
secondly even if psychics had the defects of their qualities and it were true
that a connection between psychic temperament and insanity could be made
out, similar to the alleged connection between genius and insanity, it might
still be useful and we might still ask: "What then is more natural than
that this temperament should introduce one to corners of the universe,
which your robust Philistine type of nervous system, forever offering its
biceps to be felt, thumping its breast, and thanking Heaven that it hasn't
a single morbid fibre in its composition, would be sure to hide forever from
its self-satisfied possessors?" (p. 25.)
In his chapter on the "Reality of the Unseen" Professor James quotes
cases (p. 61-2) from the Journal of the S.P.R. and from Phantoms of the
Living to prove the reality of the immediate experience of an unseen
presence, which appears so often to assume a specially religious form.
Into his account of "the religion of healthy-mindedness," Professor James
inserts a very sympathetic description (which will doubtless be no end of a
shock to many professorial pedants) of the 'mind-cure' movement, declaring
it to be " the one original American contribution to philosophy." It is, of
course, diametrically opposed to science, in that it assumes that things
operate by personal forces and for the sake of individual ends, instead of
being the results of impersonal and universal formulas. Yet both appeal to
experience for verification. And the funny thing is that experience, in a
measure, verifies both. Nor must this success of mind-cure be wet-blanketed
by the phrase ' suggestion,' which has become merely the scientific s,lang for
' apperceiving ' the facts. It is better to admit frankly that both are
" genuine keys for unlocking the world's treasure house to him who can use
either of them practically" (p. 122), and to hold that "the universe is a
more many-sided affair than any sect, even the scientific sect, allows for."
Professor James adds in an interesting appendix a friend's case in which a
visit to a mental healer, in spite of his disbelief, started a turn for the better
in a critical condition of his health. This he explains, very much like Pro
fessor James (p. 125), as due to his "receiving telepathically and upon a
mental stratum quite below the level of immediate consciousness, a healthier
and more energetic attitude, receiving it from another person whose thought
was directed upon me with the intention of impressing the idea of this
attitude upon me." He admits that his trouble was of a nature which
would be classified as nervous rather than organic, but thinks that the
dividing line is an arbitrary one, as the nerves control the whole intemal
economy. Hence he is on the whole " inclined to think that the healing
action, like the morbid one, springs from the plane of the normally uncon
scious mind."
It is, however, when he reaches the subject of " Conversion " that Pro
fessor James appeals most decisively to the ideas with which the labours of
Myers have familiarized the readers of these Proceedings. Conversion is
most probably connected with the possession of a subconscious, subliminal, or
transmarginal self, in which the motives deposited by the experiences of life
are incubated, and which, if very active, may even produce sudden and
XLV.] Review. 407
seemingly inexplicable changes. " I cannot but think," he says (p. 233),
"that the most important step forward that has occurred in psychology since
I have been a student of that science is the discovery, first made in 1886,
that, in certain subjects at least, there is not only the consciousness of the
ordinary field, with its usual centre and margin, but an addition thereto in
the shape of a set of memories, thoughts, and feelings which are extra-
marginal and outside of the primary consciousness altogether, but yet must
be classed as conscious facts of some sort, able to reveal their presence by
unmistakable signs. I call this the most important step forward because,
unlike the other advances which psychology has made, this discovery has
revealed to us an entirely unsuspected peculiarity in the constitution of
human nature. No other step forward which psychology has made can
proffer any such claim as this."
From this subliminal region, then, proceed not only conversions, but all
sorts of automatic "uprushes" or "explosions" of ideas elaborated outside
the field of ordinary consciousness, motor impulses, obsessive ideas, unaccoun
table caprices, delusions, and hallucinations of hypnotic or hysterical subjects.
The religious cases must in the first instance submit to formal psychological
classification along with these—as indeed the religious admit, after their
fashion, when they dispute as to the divine or diabolical origin of these
phenomena. This classification, however, leaves untouched their value, and
the question of the ultimate origin of the beneficial influences. It is con
ceivable (p. 242) that " if there be higher spiritual agencies that can directly
touch us, the psychological condition of their doing so might be our possession
of a subconscious region which alone should yield access to them. The
hubbub of the waking life might close a door which in the dreamy Sub
liminal might remain ajar or open."
The " mystical " consciousness is all too familiar to ordinary men as an
effect of chemicals, the sway of alcohol over mankind being " unquestionably
due to its power to stimulate the mystical faculties of human nature"
(p. 387). Thus " the drunken consciousness is one bit of the mystic
consciousness," which, however, is still more powerfully stimulated by
nitrous oxide. Its key-note is invariably a reconciliation in which all the
opposites in the world are melted into unity in such a way that the higher
and better species appears as itself the genus. The theoretic importance of
these mystic states is (p. 423) that " they break down the authority of the
non-mystical or rationalistic consciousness baaed upon the understanding and
the senses alone. They show it to be only one kind of consciousness. They
open out the possibility of other orders of truth." And yet religious
mysticism is only the better half of the subject. Side by side with it we
may find in delusional insanity or paranoia a sort of diabolical mysticism,
exhibiting the same psychological symptoms, but with a pessimistic trend,
and also springing " from that great subliminal or transmarginal region of
which science is beginning to admit the existence, but of which so little is
really known " (p. 426).
In his last lecture Professor James finally inquires into the objective truth
408 F. C. S. Schiller. [I-ART
underlying all this religious experience and returns to the question, reserved
before, as to the ultimate source of the subliminal inspiration and of the
immediate assurance it seems to give of a communion with diviner powers
which effect our salvation. In the last resort the whole of religious
experience seems to rest on " the fact that the conscious person is continuous
with a wider self, through which saving experiences come " (p. 515), and
this " is literally and objectively true as far as it goes."
Beyond this common result of all religions we pass into the realm
of hypotheses and " over-beliefs," as to which Professor James is laudably
reluctant to dogmatize. But he personally believes that the infiltration of
spiritual energy which the religious seem to experience is no merely
subjective illusion, but a real fact. For notwithstanding the studied
impersonalism of our scientific assumptions, it is only in our personal
life that we comprehend real fact and transcend abstractions. If therefore
the abstract point of view of Science be naturalism, then Professor
James is a supernaturalist.
But supernaturalism is of two kinds, refined and universalistic, or crass
and " piece-meal." The former, which has been excogitated by mauy of the
transcendentalist theologians and philosophers of the day, repudiates, not
merely miracle, but every action of the supernatural on the natural.
Nothing is altered in the natural course of events by the existence of its
" God " or " Absolute." Its "God " neither answers prayers, nor helps men,
nor aims at ends, nor gives ground for moral hope. He is simply a paint of
view—the point of view of the Whole—and beyond affording a peculiar satis
faction to those who like to take that point of view, he makes not the
slightest difference to anybody or anything. This universalistic super-
uaturalism, however, Professor James thinks, is practically a surrender to
naturalism. We can have no use for a "God" who makes no difference :
"our difficulties and our ideals are all piece-meal affairs, but the Absolute
can do no piecework for us ; so that all the interests which our poor souls
compass raise their heads too late" (p. 522). Hence Professor James
pleads for " a candid consideration of piece-meal supernaturalism " and
believes that "a complete discussion of all its metaphysical bearings will
show it to be the hypothesis by which the largest number of legitimate
requirements are met" (p. 523).
A real God, therefore, must produce real effects, and so in our cominunings
with the wider self " work is actually done upon our finite personality ; for
we are turned into new men, and consequences in the way of conduct follow
in the natural world upon our regenerative change. But that which
produces effects within another reality must be termed a reality itself, so I
feel as if we had no philosophic excuse for calling the unseen or mystical
world unreal" (p. 516).
To identify this real power with an absolute world-ruler is, however, a
very considerable over-belief. All that religious experience unequivocally
testifies to is that there is something larger tliau our conscious selves,
continuous with us and friendly to our ideals. " Any thing larger will do,
XLV.] Review. 409
if only it be large enough to truat for the next step. It need not be infinite,
it need not be solitary. It might conceivably even be only a larger and
more godlike self, of which the present self would then be but the mutilated
expression, and the universe might conceivably be a collection of such selves,
of different degrees of inclusiveness, with no absolute unity realized in
it at all " (p. 525).
Professor James concludes with a promise to work out these hints of a
pluralistic metaphysic in a subsequent book, which will doubtless prove as
instructive as the present. Meanwhile we may add a few admiring
comments to this theory of the cardinal importance for religion of sub
conscious inspiration. And first of all attention should be drawn to a slight
change of terminology. Professor James often prefers the term trans-
marginal to subliminal. The reason is clear : the preposition sub- becomes
awkward when applied to what is envisaged as a source of higher inspiratiou.
It is better not to seem to beg questions by denominating it what lies
across (trans) the border. Perhaps as a compromise the term transliminal
might be found convenient.
In the second place I find myself, with all deference, unable altogether to
follow Professor James in his appreciation of the mystical states of
consciousness. At least I should contend strongly that whether arrived at
by rational means or not, all the products of our mental life should be
subjected to rational tests, and rejected if they turn out to be essentially
irrational and unprofitable. Now, on Professor James' own showing, this
objection applies strongly to almost all the mystical experiences. In
point of psychological form their nearest congeners are to be found in
drunkenness and insanity. As regards psychological content they are quite
unstable and insecure. Even though for the moment the mystic's assurance
may seem ineffably to surpass the confidence to be attained by the slow
methods of ordinary reasoning, yet it is subject to eclipses as sudden and
inexplicable as the effulgences with which it dazzled the soul. Professor
James must surely have come across some of the cases (of which the poet
Cowper is a well-known literary example) in which the conviction of being
" damned " alternated with that of being " saved," or where the experience
of mystical visions did not preclude a subsequent lapse into agnosticism and
disbelief.i For these reasons to a critically-minded mystic the question of the
cognitive value of his psychical experiences must be a great puzzle, and
a fortiori they must seem dubious to non-mystics. Regarded logically their
revelations are pervaded by hopeless contradictions, as when the highest
knowledge is described as the negation of knowledge, and the highest
consciousness as the extinction of self-consciousness (cp. p. 401). And
Professor James' generosity surely reaches an extreme when he quotes
a dreary farrago of absolute nonsense to show that "many mystical
scriptures are indeed little more than musical compositions" (p. 421).
Metaphysically again mysticism seems to point in the wrong direction.
i The answers to the Questionnaire of the American Branch contain several such
documents.
410 F. C. S. Schiller. [PART
Professor James admits that the theoretic drift of "classical religious
mysticism is in the direction of an enervating pantheistic monism and a
peculiarly flabby optimism." Both of these doctrines I agree with Professor
James in regarding as false, and both could be substantiated, if at all, only
by rigorously rational demonstration. The mystics content themselves with
affirming them on grounds so unintelligible that they can only add contempt
to the dislike for them one had previously entertained. Finally, from
a practical and moral point of view, the fruits of mysticism seem to be
mainly evil. It seems to be an even chance that the 'religious' mystic will
set himself wholly above morality ; and even if he does not in this respect
imitate his alcohol-imbibing and drug-inhaling confreres, his ecstasies
produce nothing of value for practical life. Judged, therefore, by the
•' pragmatist " standards of Professor James, mysticism, wherever it crops
up, in Hinduism, in Buddhism, in Neoplatonism, in Catholicism, in Whit-
mania, must be pronounced worthless as such and devoid of rational
authority over us. Even the theoretic gain of mysticism, viz. the knowledge
that the ordinary consciousness does not exhaust the whole of experience,
may be obtained more simply from the facts of dream, trance, etc. The
important question as to all such states is not as to their existence, but as to
their practical value and rational significance.
Lastly as regards the value of the " transmarginal self " for the purpose of
psychological explanation. / cannot see that, apart from psychical research,
it has any. If it merely meant negatively that the mainsprings of our
mental life were not to be found in consciousness, and implied that every
thing beyond was unknowable, it would not advance science. It would
merely add one to the technical phrases whereby baffled philosophers and
theologians have tried to gloze over their failures to satisfy our demands for
knowledge. And it would deserve to be cast on the metaphysical rubbish-
heap together with the ' Unknowablet' and 'Abtoluiet ' of other ' thinkers.' But
Professor James clearly means his "transmarginal" to be something more,
to be afield for scientific research (p. 611), in which our Society would have
a prescriptive claim to a prominent part. What the transmarginal really is
is what we have to find out. And just in proportion as our research is
successful, it is evident that what was beyond the margin will be included
in it, that the soul will extend her borders, and that our whole consciousness
will be augmented and glorified by the assimilation of what is now
" subconscious."
The practical value of Professor James' confession of faith in the reality
of our spiritual intercourse with higher powers I take to be very similar.
Regarded as a mere personal 'over-belief it is of course psychologically
interesting, but its logical value is slight. The true import of the doctrine
however lies in the suggestion it conveys that such personal religious
experiences are not insusceptible of scientific treatment. They are now
declared to be worthy of scientific attention, and through them the light of
psychology may find access to the preserves of theological dogma. By
turning so much of a theologian Professor James may prevail on theologians
XLV.] Review. 411
to turn psychologists. And so in the end it may come about that, as I once
suggested with reference to a similar plea of Mr. Andrew Lang's, theology
will be rendered an experimental science, and as auch recover the hold over
the human mind which it now appears to have lost.
In taking leave of Professor James' fascinating lectures I must remark on
what will seem to many a very curious fact, viz., the almost total omission
of the topic of immortality from a description of religious feelings. Professor
James' record as a psychical researcher and lecturer on Human Immortality
is too well known to allow one to put this down to prejudice or aversion. To
me it seems rather like an unsolicited confirmation of the view that
immortality, whatever it may have been in the past, is not now an important
object of desire. However, as I am at present engaged in a statistical
inquiry into the real character and extent of this traditional craving, I can
confine my remarks to the little Professor James does say in his Postscript.
Having spoken of the necessity that a real God must make a difference, he
goes on to say (p. 524) that the first difference such a God should make would
be personal immortality. But it seems to him a point secondary to an
eternal caring for our ideals. It is however " eminently a case for facts to
testify. Facts, I think, are yet lacking to prove ' spirit-return,' though I
have the highest respect for the patient labours of Messrs. Myers, Hodgson,
and Hyslop, and am somewhat impressed by their favourable conclusions."
This interesting pronouncement of so great and sympathetic an authority
indicates perhaps how far calmly dispassionate science is disposed to go in
the present state of the evidence ; and though it may seem but little to the
more sanguine, I would bid them remember (1) that Professor James has
himself explained how a " will to believe " is justified in cases of this sort,
and how faith may legitimately outstrip knowledge, provided always that
" faith " leads to " works" which confirm it ; and (2) that proof is essentially
cumulative, and that comparatively little more of the sort of evidence
we have already succeeded in getting recorded might complete the proof
sufficiently to shift the ' burden of proof ' on to those who as yet will to
disbelieve. There is plenty of scope, therefore, for energetic exertion both
in improving the evidence and in disposing the social atmosphere more
favourably towards its investigation.

Le Temple Enseveli, by MAURICE MAETERLINCK (Paris, 1902. Bibliotheque-
Charpentier. 3 fr. 50).
This book consists of six chapters, entitled respectively " Justice," " The
Evolution of Mystery," " The Kingdom of Matter," "The Past," "Chance,"
and " The Future." It is with the last two only that psychical research has
any particular concern.
After citing various exceptionally lucky and unlucky careers, the author
concludes that, every possible attempt having been made to explain such
obstinately repeated runs of luck by known physical and moral causes, there
412 J. O. Piddington. [PART
yet remains over and above no inconsiderable number of episodes in such
lives which can only be attributed to the impenetrable will of an unknown
though real power, call it Luck, Fate, Destiny, or what we will. But by
whatever name we call it, this mysterious power is neither God nor Destiny ;
it is not erternal to ourselves, but within us.
Beneath our conscious existence, which owes obedience to our reason and
will, lies a deeper existence, stretching both into an immemorial past and
into a limitless future. M. Maeterlinck calls this existence "la vie incon-
tciente," "I'Stre incontcient," or " finconscient," but since it is but what we
have learnt' to call the subliminal consciousness or the subconscious self
(albeit in a glorified form), and since, too, it is with the immense range
of its activities and with its occasional inrushes into the normal conscious
ness that the writer is particularly occupied, it will make for clearness
if we render the French terms by " subconsciousness " or some similar
expression.
M. Maeterlinck knocks down " the Gods " (as he calls them) only to set up
in their stead the subconscious self, which he endows with almost divine
attributes. It is the veritable Ego, pre-existent, universal, and " probably
immortal." (We like the "probably.") It inhabits another plane of exist
ence, where Time and Space are not. For it there is no far or near, neither
past nor future, nor resistance of matter. It is omniscient and omnipotent ;
and it may not be too much, perhaps, to speak of its active principle as
the essential fluid, the ultra-violet rays of Life. Yet, although it is
probably the common possession of all men, it does not speak to the
intelligent or normal consciousness of all either with equal clearness or
frequency.
But what has this subconscious self to do with, or how can it be held
responsible for, the good or bad luck that may attend a human life ? M.
Maeterlinck answers the question in this way : " An event, propitious or
disastrous, proceeding from the depths of the great eternal laws, rises up on
our path and bars it completely. There it looms, immovable, fatal, unshak
able. With us it has no concern, it is not there for us. Its raison <f(tre is
in itself and for itself alone. Us it simply does not know. It is we who
draw near it, we who, once within the range of its influence, must flee from
it or face it, circumvent or cross it. I will suppose it to be an unlucky event :
a shipwreck, a fire, a thunderbolt, or death, disease, accident, or suffering in
a somewhat unusual form. It waits, invisible, blind, indifferent, a thing
complete, unchangeable, but as yet potential. It exists in its entirety, but
only in the future ; while for us, whose senses adapted to the service of our
intelligence and our consciousness are so made that they perceive things only
successively in time, it is still as though it did not exist.
" For the sake of greater precision, let us imagine the event in question to
be a shipwreck. The ship that needs must be lost has not yet left port ; the
rock or the wreckage that will split her in twain is sleeping peacefully
beneath the waves ; or the storm, that will not break before the month is
out, slumbers beyond our ken in the hidden places of the heavens. Nor
XLV.] Review. 413
mally, if the fiat had not gone forth, and if the catastrophe had not already
taken place in the future, fifty passengera come from five or six different
countries would have embarked. But the ship bears clearly on her the
brand of fate. Perish she certainly must. And so, for months, perhaps for
years before, a mysterious selection has been at work among the travellers
who ought otherwise to have started together on the same day. Possibly
out of the original fifty twenty only embark when the time comes to weigh
anchor. Perhaps not even a single one of the fifty obeys the call of circum
stances which would have necessitated his departure had the future disaster
not been in existence, and, may be, their places have been taken by twenty
or thirty others in whom the voice of chance does not speak with the same
strength. But with this imaginary case before us—which is merely a more
striking illustration of what is constantly happening within the narrower
range of every-day life—is it not more natural to suppose, instead of having
recourse to far-off shadowy gods, that it is our subconscious self which acts
and decides ? It knows, it must know, it must see the catastrophe, for
neither Time nor Space exists for it, and the catastrophe is taking place at
the very moment beneath its eyes, even as it is taking place beneath the
eyes of the Eternal Forces. How it gives forewarning of the coming evil
matters little. Out of thirty travellers who receive warning, two or three
will have had an actual presentiment of the danger ; these are they in whom
the subconsciousness has freer play, and reaches more readily the primary
strata, obscure though they be, of the intelligent consciousness. The rest will
have no misgivings, they will rail at inexplicable delays and obstacles, they
will do their utmost to arrive in time, but start they will not. Some of
them will fall ill, miss their way, change their plans, meet with some trivial
adventure, or a quarrel, a flirtation, a lazy or an absent-minded fit will
detain them in spite of themselves. Others of them, again, will never have
dreamed of embarking on the predestined ship, although logically and fatally
she was the only one that they ought to have chosen.
" In the case of the majority, these efforts of the subconsciousness to save
them are carried out at depths so great that it will never occur to them that
they owe their life to their good luck, and they will believe in all good faith
that they never had any intention of boarding the vessel that the Powers of
the Sea had marked for their own."
As for the unlucky, they must not imagine that the universe is hostile to
them, but rather they should blame their own subconscious selves. " Their
unconscious soul," says Maeterlinck, " their unconscious soul does not do its
duty." And he goes on to ask : " Is it (i.e. the inefficient subconsciousness)
more awkward or less attentive ? Does it sleep in despair in the depths of a
prison more closely barred than others ? Can no act of will stir it from so
deadly a slumber?" Apparently, in M. Maeterlinck's opinion, the case is
not hopeless. Either the supraliminal consciousness (which answers to what
the author calls "la vie intelligente," or "la volonU et Vintelligence ") develops
a sufficient receptivity, or the subconsciousness a sufficient attentiveness to
the needs of its junior partner. To sum up, then, good luck depends upon an
414 J. G. Piddington. [PABT
effective, bad luck on a defective intercommunication between the conscious
and the subconscious strata.
The reception which this bold and novel theory is likely to meet with from
orthodox philosophy can hardly be favourable ; but students of the S.P.R.
Proceedings and Journal, and those especially who have felt the force of
Mr. Myers' papers on the subliminal consciousness will not be too ready
to dismiss it offhand as pure mysticism. In any case it is only possible
to do justice to M. Maeterlinck's conception if we consider it apart from
his ill-chosen illustrations of shipwrecks, railway accidents, fires, etc., and
indeed apart from all disasters which may depend, in part at least, on
human agency ; and if we apply it to the cases of such calamities only
as may be regarded as practically unaffected by man's intervention, e.g. a
volcanic eruption. In cases of the latter class it is logically conceivable
that the subliminal self may act, in some such way as he suggests, by
simply preventing the person from getting within rauge of any particular
natural catastrophe. Any supposed power of prevision, however, implies
that the future is already fixed and is not to be influenced by human
will. Hence the theory is self-contradictory, if applied to cases where
the thing to be avoided may be either caused or modified through volun
tary human action.
But apart from this fundamental confusion of thought, which—as will
be seen from the extracts quoted—pervades the whole argument, it is
chiefly when we come to consider the way in which the case is presented,
and the exaggerated claims put forward on behalf of the subconscious
self that we psychical researchers, with our prejudice for plain well-
attested facts, are likely to part company with M. Maeterlinck. On what
grounds of fact he relies, if indeed he pretends to proffer any facts at
all, it is not easy to say. He would seem to have evolved his doctrine
out of his own inner consciousness, unhampered by any details of evidence,
and then to have thrown in a few generalized facts as an after-thought.
He quotes no authorities ; he makes no acknowledgment of the labours
of those who have ploddingly explored the psychological fields in which
he himself runs riot. It is true that he cites the experiences of a friend,
but they are vague and unconvincing ; and in a foot-note to p. 261 he
makes some remarkable statements, which, if true, would indeed lend
strong support to his conclusions, but unfortunately there is no reason
to attach any credibility to these statements. It is worth while to trans
late almost in full this foot-note, because it contains practically the only
attempt at positive evidence in support of the previsionary and premoni
tory powers with which M. Maeterlinck endows "the unconscious soul."
The note runs thus : " It is indeed a common occurrence and worthy of
note that in the case of great catastrophes the number of victims is
usually infinitely smaller than on the most reasonable calculation of pro
babilities one would have been led to apprehend. At the last minute a
fortuitous and exceptional circumstance has almost always kept away
half and sometimes two-thirds of the people menaced by the as yet in
XLV.] Review. 415
visible danger. A steamer which founders has generally many fewer
passengers on board than she would have had had she not been doomed
to sink. Two trains that run into collision, an express which falls over
a precipice, and so on, carry fewer passengers than on days when nothing
happens to them. The collapse of a bridge most frequently occurs, quite
contrary to what one would expect, just after the crowd has left it.
Unfortunately there is not the same immunity in the case of fires in
theatres and other places of public assembly. But here, as we know, it
is not the fire, but rather the presence of an affrighted and maddened
crowd which constitutes the chief danger. On the other hand, an ex
plosion of fire-damp takes place as a rule when there are considerably
fewer miners at work in the mine than there ought to be in the regular
course. In the same way a powder or a cartridge factory, etc., generally
explodes at a time when the majority of the workmen, who otherwise
would have inevitably perished, have gone away from the works for
some trifling, though providential, reason or other. So true is this fact
that the almost constant observation of it has resulted in a sort of familiar
stock phrase. Any <lay we may read in the newspapers under the items
of general news sentences like this : ' A catastrophe which might have
had terrible consequences, thanks to such and such a circumstance was
happily confined to ... etc.' Or, again : ' One shudders to think that,
had the same accident happened a minute sooner, when all the workmen,
or all the passengers, . . . etc.' "
On this flimsy foundation of newspaper snippets M. Maeterlinck would
seem to have built his theoretic edifice. The futility of the examples
quoted in this foot-note is really too obvious to be worth exposing.
Certainly, if one troubled oneself as little as the author to produce sub
stantial evidence, or made as little allowance for mere coincidence, it
would not be difficult to make out a case for the existence of a malevolent
deity, whose special function was to cause ships and trains to be wrecked,
boilers to burst, theatres to burn at moments^which promised the largest
haul of human victims. Had M. Maeterlinck deigned to consult any
thing so prosaic as the railway annals of his own country, he would have
found in the extraordinary frequency of accidents to trains crammed with
holiday folk on Belgian jours de fete some facts which will not square with
his fancies. Our own researches do seem to point to the possible exemption
of the subconscious self from spatial limitations, but so far they have
contributed little towards rendering probable this larger claim of freedom
from the limitations of time which M. Maeterlinck unhesitatingly makes
for it ; and before such a claim can be considered, better evidence must
be forthcoming than the vague statements of this naive foot-note—state
ments which could be verified or refuted only by means of a world-wide
and utterly impracticable census extending over many years.
But not content with the paucity and poverty of the positive evidence
at his disposal, M. Maeterlinck, in the last chapter of the book, L'Avenir,
is candid enough to produce evidence which, so far as it goes, is un
416 J. G. Piddington. [PART
favourable to the possession by the subconscious self of that very faculty
of prevision on which his whole theory rests.
In this chapter he describes various visits paid by himself or his
friends to clairvoyants, fortune-tellers, mediums, palmists, etc., in Paris.
The results went to show that, whereas there was evidence of the sub
conscious mind being able to get at past or present facts which were or
might have been within the knowledge of the sitter or others, there was
an entire failure to foresee and foretell the Future. And this, so far as it
goes, is in accordance with the results at present arrived at by the S.P.R.
Of all the evidence in favour of supernormal faculties hitherto collected
by the Society, the weakest by far both in quantity and quality is the
evidence for prevision.
This failure to bring forward any original or borrowed evidence of
value is all the more disappointing in the author of La Vie des Abcilles, who
in that delightful work displayed not only a gift for original scientific
research, but also the power of appreciating and marshalling the scientific
observations of others.
To this criticism, if he chanced to read it, the author might perhaps
reply in the words of Symmachus, "wno itinere nan potett perveniri ad
tarn grande secreium," and that there are methods other than those of the
S.P.R. for arriving at the truth. True enough : but what is objection
able is the attempt to combine two methods, the intuitive-mystic with
the scientific. M. Maeterlinck should have contented himself with making
his intuitive guesses at truth and not at the same time have tried to
bolster them up with slipshod pseudo-scientific generalisations.
Notwithstanding these defects, the reader cannot but feel that the
whole book is not only suggestive, but deeply interesting as the record
both of the development and of what are probably the "over-beliefs" (to
use Professor William James' phrase) of an agnostic mind of wide culture
and refined sensibility.
Le Temple Enseveli has been translated into English by Mr. Alfred
Sutro. I have not seen the translation, but the Timet reviewer, while
noting the omission of the whole of the last chapter, "L'Avenir," and
of some passages in the first chapter, " La Justice," considers that the
translator has done his work adequately.

The police dossiers relating to Marie-Anne and her associates were
docketed " Affaire des faux sorciers," and it is perhaps a pity that M. de
Coynart did not adopt this title for his book : for Marie-Anne was not
a sorceress at all, but an utter fraud (which many sorceresses were not);
and also, although Marie-Anne is the central figure of the " band "
XLV.] Review. 417
whose exploits form the subject of this work, she neither brought to
gether the members of it in the first instance, nor are her dupes scarcely,
if at all, less interesting than herself.
It would be useless to attempt to give within the limits of a brief
review more than the merest outline of the contents of M. de Coynart's
book. Such, however, as like to wander along the by-paths of history,
and such as appreciate the merit of a scrupulously document^ revival of
some obscure episode of past days, will be well repaid if they consult
the full narrative.
M. de Coynart's treatment is primarily historical, and only secondarily
and incidentally psychological : yet the adventures of Marie-Anne and her
friends afford points of psychological interest deserving of our attention.
In order to appreciate them, it will be necessary to give a summary—the
barest possible, be it understood—of the events recorded by the author.
Marie-Anne de la Ville, born at Bordeaux in 1680, was the daughter
of a local lawyer of some social position but of little or no fortune.
Her mother died when she was eighteen mouths old, ami this early loss
was perhaps responsible for her subsequent depravity. When only nine
years old, she discovered in an uncle's library several occult books,
from which she learned the traditional forms of incantation, and many
other things not calculated to have the best effect on the brain of an
imaginative child. Of a good spirit named Jassemin, who figured in
one of these mystic works, she had a hallucinatory vision ; and -that the
hallucination was genuine she always maintained, nor need her word
be doubted on this point. At eleven years of age she was sent to the
Convent of the Visitation du faubourg Saint-Antoine at Paris, where
for eight years she remained. Here she probably came into contact with
Mme. Guyon, the Quietist, and to this supposed association M. de Coynart
attributes in part her later developments ; but the inference seems rather
unfair to the worthy Mme. Guyon, and Marie-Anne's early acquaintance
with occultism sufficiently explains the attraction which the subject
had for her in her maturer years.
What happened to her after leaving the convent is not precisely known,
but she seems to have been at large in Paris, and what that meant in
the 18th century is better imagined than described. When next she
is heard of, she had joined a band of treasure-seekers, which, though led
by an inferior police-officer named Divot, was composed of members
drawn from a mixture of social classes from nearly the highest to nearly
the lowest. One of the most important, by reason of his sacred calling,
was a Prior, by name Pinel ; the presence and offices of a priest being
held indispensable to the successful raising of the devil. Marie-Anue
soon became the mistress of the Prior, and, but for short intervals when
her more than easy morals led her to seek a change, remained so during
the three years of adventure which followed ; but it is only fair to the
Prior to add that the liaison was none of his seeking, and that far from
being in collusion with Marie-Anne, he was utterly her dupe, and further
418 J. G. Piddington. [PART
more her stauuchest friend,— a most pathetic figure, more worthy of pity
than of condemnation or contempt.
The band had been in existence some seven or eight years before Marie-
Anne joined it, and in spite of the unbroken failure of its operations,
the ardour of its members had not been damped, nor had hopes of ultimate
success been abandoned. The belief was then, as in past centuries, largely
prevalent among all ranks of society that not only the natural virgin
treasure of the earth but also treasure left hidden by man was guarded
by demons : and the aim of the band of treasure-seekers was to conjure the
demon guardians to deliver up their hoards either simply in obedience
to irresistible incantations, or in exchange for human souls. Marie-Anne
soon became the leader of the company and the prime mover in their
expeditious, because she claimed knowledge of the traditional incantations
and modus operandi, in which the other members were admittedly not
adepts.
It would be outside the scope of this review to narrate the various
and fruitless expeditions undertaken by the company at Marie-Anne's
instigation, or to describe in detail how in face of repeated insuccess she
managed to retain the confidence and support of her companions, how
she literally worked the oracle to provide herself with creature-comforts
at the expense of her associates and particularly of the Prior (ruined
financially as well as morally by his infatuation), how she varied the
monotony of treasure-hunting with interludes of spirit communications
and simple physical phenomena, and how, in short, she ran through an
extensive repertoire of mediumistic tricks and humbugged the whole party
consistently and successfully for a period of three years. The curious
reader must be referred to the book itself, where the story is told fully
and attractively, with great lucidity and some humour.
Three points, however, merit a longer reference : (a) Some instances of
illusion and hallucination. Four members of the baud together with
Marie-Anne were engaged on a treasure-hunt at D'Arcueil. While Marie-
Anne was (or was supposed to be) performing her lengthy incantations,
the others by way of passing the time until her return from the scene
of operations were dining in a neighbouring inn. Two hours passed,
and the four diners, wondering at the delay, set out to see how the
sorceress was progressing ; when, to quote the official record of the Prior
Pinel's evidence before M. d'Argenson, they saw " a man on horseback,
enveloped in a red cloak (although the weather was very fine). He was
about half a league distant from the said Marie-Anne, but when the
Prior and the others drew a little nearer to her, they were surprised to
see the horseman by the side of her, although a moment before he had
been very far away from her. This threw them into such a state of
astonishment that they lay on the ground in order not to see him, being
convinced that the horseman was the Spirit, who was going to maltreat
her because they had had the ^temerity to watch her in spite of her
having forbidden them to do so." Marie-Anne must have witnessed her
XLV.] Review. 419
companions' fright, and guessed the cause of it : for when she rejoined
them her face and head were " covered with bruises," and her head-dress
was gone. Of course the Evil Spirit had thus wreaked his wrath on her
because the others had " broken the conditions " (to use a modern phrase),
and of course the horseman in the red cloak was none other than the
Evil Spirit himself. Another member of the party, M. de Brederodes,
gives a highly coloured account of the same scene, but the relatively sober
narrative of the Prior probably comes nearer to representing the mean
hallucinatory experience as shared by the four percipients.
Now, in her examination before M. d'Argenson, Marie-Anne declared
that no such horseman had come near her. A real horseman there may
well have been, who was seen in the distance by the others and not by
Marie-Anne, but her sharp eyes would not have failed to notice him had he
really come near her. And as there was nothing to be lost or gained by
denying the story of her comrades, Marie-Anne's version is more easily
accepted than the miraculously rapid movements of the mysterious man
on horseback.
On another occasion at Arcueil Marie-Anne had made her companions
stand in a line with their noses turned to a wall, while she with a lighted
wax-taper in her hand was going through her usual performances. The
incantations finished, she caught hold of a branch of an overhanging tree,
and shook it with all her might in order to extinguish the taper. Her
dupes described this incident to M. d'Argenson as follows : " A great
blast of wind, extraordinary for so calm a night, suddenly arose and
shook the branches and put out Marie-Anne's taper."
Once the Prior believed he had heard the Spirit prescribe certain
remedies for Marie-Anne, whereas Marie-Anne stated to M. d'Argenson
that she had merely asked for the remedies "sans contrefaire sa voix"
Another time Pinel and the others said they had seen the Spirit in
the guise of a tall man. Marie-Anne, however, when this episode was
touched on in her cross-examination declared that she had seen nothing.
It must not be supposed that these four instances exhaust the list, for
there were plenty more. The followers of Marie-Anne lived in an atmos
phere of hallucination ; and so strained was their state of expectancy,
that any trivial incident might at any moment be translated by their
fancy into a miraculous event.
(6) The uncritical attitude of the band.
No member of the regular band, nor any of the outsiders who occasionally
witnessed Marie-Anne's performances suspected her bona fides, two un
important exceptions apart,—unimportant because, although one individual,
a novice, said he thought the whole thing was a trick, and another,
equally new to the phenomena, mildly suggested that the Spirit's voice
was only Marie-Anne's disguised,—both very soon convinced themselves
of the genuineness of the sorceress' powers. This almost complete absence
of suspicion was due, no doubt, in part to Mlle, de la Villa's cleverness ;
but unless we remember to transport ourselves back into an age when
420 J. G. Piddington. [PART
belief in magic yet widely obtained, we shall be in danger of unduly
exaggerating her powers of deception.
Nowadays people do not believe in the supernatural without, at least,
first obtaining some evidential facts (or what they consider to be such)
in order to dispel their a priori scepticism. But to the a priori credulity
of Marie-Anne's times such cautious preliminaries would have seemed
uncalled for, and to have questioned the reality of the interference of
evil spirits in human affairs would have appeared almost as ridiculous,
at least to the average man, as it would have not so many years earlier
to doubt that the sun moved round the earth.
(c) The examination and confession of Marie-Anne.
Divot turned informer, with the result that Marie-Anne was arrested
in February, 1703. At the time of her arrest she was found to have
" une esptce de tifflet " in her throat. Thanks to malingering, which quite
took in the young officer sent to convey her to Paris, it was not until
August that she was lodged in the Bastille : whither she had been pre
ceded by seventeen of her accomplices, or rather dupes.
The enquiry was conducted by the celebrated M. d'Argenson in person,
and lasted nearly four months. All the prisoners, except M. de Bredero'les,
were found guilty and were severely punished : Marie-Anne, the chief
culprit, being sentenced to imprisonment for life and to a perpetual diet
of bread and water. She was imprisoned in the Hfrpital, now called
the Salptitriere ; and it is permissible to fancy that had she flourished in
a happier hour, she might have figured among a crowd of sister de'traqueet
as a patient, instead of as a prisoner, within the self-same walls.
Should any reader in the course of perusing the veracious history of
Marie- Anne de la Ville suspect that M. de Coynart has painted his
heroine with too black a brush, and that amidst all the admitted fraud
there may have been glimmerings of genuine psychic power, his hopes
of a possible partial rehabilitation of the sorceress' character will be
rudely dashed when he reaches the last chapter but one, which deals
with her examination before M. d'Argeuson. Her avowal of fraud was
complete : and such reservations as she did attempt to make were con
cerned not with her pretended magic but with her relations with the
Prior Pinel. The woman in her was still capable of a sense of shame,
if the charlatan was not.
The chief interest of her examination lies in the answers, in which
are directly stated, or from which can be inferred, the motives of her
fraud. They may be summarised as follows :
(1) She honestly believed, at least at first, in her magical incantations ;
and if towards the end of three years she did lose, or began to lose, faith
in them, the general tone of her replies to M. d'Argenson's questions seems
to imply that it was only in the efficacy of the particular incantations
to which her acquaintance happened to be limited, and not in the general
possibility of summoning and gaiuiug ascendancy over evil spirits, that
she had lost confidence.
XLV.] Review. 421
(2) She believed iu the truth of the stories of buried treasures.
(3) She resolutely maintained her conviction that the apparition of the
angel Jassemin, which she had experienced in childhood, was " a real thing."
(4) She admitted that she had often pretended to call up and converse
with the spirit merely to please (satisfaire) her companions.
(5) She denied that money was her object, and declared that she fre
quently went through her tricks for the mere fun of laughing in her
sleeve at the credulity of her followers.
Mr. H. G. Wells has made the pleasure of gulling the credulous the
dominant note in the character of the fraudulent medium that he has
portrayed in his Love and Mr. Leurisham. But for such a motive to be
more than fitfully operative demands the possession by the charlatan of a
larger degree of intelligent cynicism than would seem to have been con
sistent with the unthinking Bohemianism of Mlle, de la Ville. It was
one among several motives, no doubt, as perhaps it may be in the case
of all charlatans, but it was not the dominant one.
Love of money, in spite of her denial, was certainly an incentive, though
not, perhaps, one of the strongest ; for Mlle, de la Ville could easily have
turned her wits and her looks to more profitable account than to duping
an impecunious Prior, and it was only rarely that a well-to-do person
joined the band, and then but for a short time. In so far as she had
hoped at first to possess herself of treasure by magic arts, money was her
object ; but, in spite of one or two shady episodes, she must be acquitted
of having primarily aimed at extracting money from her companions.
It is easy enough to conjecture other motives besides those which
Marie-Anne admitted, but I believe that the essential motive lay in her
own credulity. If she had not originally believed that spirits of evil
could be evoked from the nether world and subdued by magical rites,
her career might not indeed have proved less criminal, but it would not
have taken the particular direction which it did.
We are usually content to assume that the practice of fraudulent
mediumship is due to a love of money, or of notoriety, or of deception,
but we might do well to add another motive to the list, namely, the
belief, or at least the expectation, held by a medium at the outset of his
career, that if he perform the necessary ceremonies and follow the recog
nised procedure, supernormal phenomena will follow in due course.
Some lines from the introductory chapter may serve to conclude this
review of M. de Coynart's book : " Dealing though it does for the most
part with very obscure individuals, this history shows to what depths of
credulity persons of all ranks and not wanting in intelligence can descend.
Though this truth will be borne out by a narrative based throughout on
authentic documents, it evidently does not follow that all marvels can
therefore be explained away. But, at least, this history will demonstrate
what great precautions we must all of us take to protect ourselves from
the workings of our own imagination or from the suggestions of others."

Deux&me Congrlt International de Fffypnotisme Experimental et Thera-
peutique. Comptet Rendut (320 pp., large 8vo. Vigot Frdres, Paris, 1902.
10 fre.).
This volume contains a report of the Congress held in Paris in August,
1900, under the presidency of Professor Raymond and Dr. Jules Voisin
of the Salpgtriere. It is edited by Dr. B6rillon and Dr. Farez, and is
well printed and got up with 56 illustrations and diagrams.
About forty physicians and jurists interested in the subject attended
the Congress, representing all parts of the world, and papers were con
tributed by several members who were unable to appear in person. The
papers deal with hypnotism from the psychological as well as from the
purely medical point of view. Among the most important is that by
Dr. Beiillon giving the history of hypnotism. In this he does full
justice to James Braid, whom he considers the founder of the scientific
and modern school, though it is, he says, to Li6beault of Nancy that we
owe the practical recognition of the value of hypnotic treatment.
It is not easy at this time to say anything new on the subject, but
Dr. Oscar Vogt of Berlin, and Drs. Paul Farez and F61ix R6gnanlt of Paris
contribute papers on the value of hypnotism in psychological investiga
tions. Dr. Farez gives illustrations showing how the working of the
subconscious self may be rendered manifest in the hypnotic state. For
instance, a girl aged 25 who was obsessed by the thought that she must
throw herself out of the window, explained when hypnotised that the
idea arose from her having seen such an accident portrayed in an
illustrated paper, though she had no memory of it in her waking state.
Recognition of the cause enabled Dr. Farez to cure the obsession by
counter-suggestion. He tells a somewhat disconcerting story of a dramatic
author who allowed himself to be frequently hypnotised by his wife,
who at last was able to throw him into profound hypnosis by touching
the nape of his neck, and to change his ordinary sleep into hypnotic
trance. She made use of this power to dictate his conduct to him. For
instance, on one occasion M. X. found himself unable to walk up the
stairs leading to a friend's rooms, and thought that he was becoming
paralysed. In alarm he went to Dr. Farez, who hypnotised him and
discovered that the wife had out of jealousy suggested the physical
inability to visit the friend she objected to. If Mme. X. had goue
a little further and suggested to her husband that no one but herself
could hypnotise him, it would have been difficult to overcome her undue
influence.
Dr. RCgnault endeavours to explain by the light of the most recent
discoveries in psychology and neurology how hypnosis assists the action
of suggestion. He argues that in the waking state a sensation sets up a
centripetal nerve current which excites corresponding psychic cells in the
brain cortex, and these he terms "centres of sentiment." These centres
represent sentiments and ideas, and transmit the impulses to the motor
XLV.] Review. 423
neurons. It is the neuron which vibrates the most which induces the
responsive action.
In profound hypnosis, Dr. Regnault thinks, the suggested sensation
acts so powerfully on the psychic cell or centre of sentiment that only
one idea is aroused and, therefore, free choice in conduct is prevented.
This is only another way of expressing Bernheim's contention that
hypnotism enables the operator to stimulate or suppress a function by
acting on its cerebral centre through the suggested idea.
Several physicians including Tokarsky of Moscow, de Jong of the
Hague, Lloyd Tuckey of London, Stadelmann of Wurtzburg, contributed
papers on the treatment of drunkenness by hypnotism ; and the general
experience was of an encouraging nature. BeVillon attached much impor
tance to the creation of a "psychic centre of inhibition" which he brings
about by suggesting to the hypnotised patient that he is unable to con
vey a glass containing alcohol to his mouth. At the same time he is
made to hold a glass in his hand and shown jhow he is paralysed when
he attempts to raise it to his lips. By repetition the suggestion becomes,
aa it were, a fixed idea which effectually pi-events indulgence.
Other papers deal with hypnotism and medical jurisprudeoce (Dr. v.
Schrenck-Notzing of Munich has made this latter subject quite his own) ;
the regulation of the practice of hypnotism by the State ; the relation of
hypnosis to ordinary sleep, etc.

Will Power, How to Acquire and Strengthen, by RICHARD J. EBBARD.
(London, 1902. pp. 275. 8vo. The Modern Medical Publishing Co.)
This is one of many books published lately on the subject of will
power and it is a fair example of its class. The theory of the subliminal
self, so ably worked out by Mr. Myers and other members of the S.P.R.,
is largely responsible for the prominence given to the subject, but the
followers go much further than the pioneers would consider authorised
by facts. According to Ebbard and his school the subconscious self is
not only omniscient but also omnipotent, and has only to be properly
trained and suitably evoked to cure all the ills which afflict the human
body and mind. Herr Ebbard is a profound believer in the Nancy school
of hypnotism, but he considers hypnosis unnecessary. He gives elaborate
tables for self-treatment by suggestion, and he advocates this being
carried out at night while waiting for sleep. At this time, he argues,
it is possible to so influence the mind by repetition of a phrase us to
make it a dominant idea and the determining influence on function and
conduct.
The book contains much good advice, and many of the directions given
are based on sound common sense. The author mixes up a good many
other things with his psychic treatment, so that a patient studying it
might feel a good deal puzzled, and feel inclined to consult Herr
424 Dr. Charles Lloyd Tuckey. [PART
Ebbard—a not unwished-for result, perhaps. Several patent and quack
remedies are vaunted and altogether one is reminded of the saying
attributed to Talleyrand that appropriate incantations and arsenic will

Have You a Strong Will? By C. G. LELAND. (Second and Enlarged
Edition, pp. 284. 8vo. Philip Welby, London, 1902.)
A book by the veteran author of The Brritmann Battadt commands
respectful attention, and when Mr. Leland assures us that his memory
has improved since his seventieth birthday by following out the rules
he explains in his book, we are bound to believe him, and to acknow
ledge the value of the lesson he teaches.
The case of another "Grand Old Man," the late Dr. Brown Sequard,
the famous neurologist of Paris, however, occurs to one's mind, and how
he thought he had discovered the elixir of life and could renew his own
youth and energy by its use.
Mr. Leland discourses in his pleasant style on the different systems of
artificial memory, which are all, he says, based on association of ideas ;
and then he comes to his own system, which he terms direct memory.
Briefly, this consists of cultivating the memory, and so gradually
strengthening it, by learning extracts and things by heart at bedtime
with careful attention and the strong wish to understand aud remember
them. By degrees, the author says, the memory becomes so strengthened
that one is able to remember without difficulty anything leaint in this
manner, the subconscious self being thus educated. Not only is memory
improved, but character can be formed and vicious tendencies can be
amended. Mr. Leland says he began to practise on himself, willing that
he should be able to work all the next day without fatigue. In this
way he acquired confidence and facility, which, he adds, is marvellous in
a man of his age. It will be very interesting if some of the members
of the S.P.R. will carry out the author's suggestions and let us know the
result. A person who can never remember Hates or figures might begin
by impressing a few of these on his mind the last thing before going
to sleep, and gradually increase the task until the normal faculty was
acquired or even surpassed.

Dr. Moll is well known as a writer on hypnotism and allied subjects,
and is a prominent physician in Berlin. In this paper he gives an account
of his investigation of Christian Science in Germany and also in the
United States. He writes from the standpoint of an educated physician,
XLV.] Review. 425
but with an open mind. He admits the cures which Mrs. Eddy and
her followers often effect, but he is convinced that these are only possible
in functional and nervous maladies. Dr. Moll quotes the offer of an
American physician who expresses his readiness to pay $1000 to any one
who can produce a single case of malignant disease cured by Christian
Science. He is an uncompromising opponent of Spiritualism, the pheno
mena of which he thinks are always produced by fraud and deception.
He quotes several gross cases which have occurred in Berlin, and he
seems to have been very unfortunate in his investigations.
Members of the S.P.R. will think Dr. Moll wanting in a sense of
fairness and proportion in his conclusions, and in his classing together
" animal-magnetism, table-moving, telepathy, spirit-rapping, materialisa
tion, and fire-walking." He says be has never, during the many years
he has made occultism a particular study, come across a single pheno
menon which was not "open to explanation by forces known to reputable
science."
Dr. Moll shows the serious risk run in treating all diseases as the
outcome of morbid imagination, and how in such a disease as appendicitis,
when a successful issue depends upon early and correct diagnosis, time
may be lost and life endangered by treating the symptoms as trivial
and neglecting to call in a doctor. He thinks that spiritualists and
Christian scientists are generally sworn enemies to the regular school of
medicine, are often strict vegetarians or enthusiastic homoeopathists, and
generally persons of unstable mental equilibrium. Dr. Moll gives a long
list of spiritualistic and occult societies existing in Berlin, and he thinks
that Germany and other countries are suffering from a psychical
epidemic.
CHAS. LLOYD TUCKEY, M.D.
Zur Psychologie und Pathologie sogenannter occulter Phiinomene. Von DR.
MED. C. G. JUNG. (Leipzig : O. Mutze, 1902, 8vo. pp. 122.)
In this little work Dr. Jung, who is Assistant Medical Officer of the
Psychiatrische Klinik at Zurich, discusses two cases which came under
his own observation. The first, very briefly related, is a case of hallucinatory
attacks followed by amnesia in a patient who suffered apparently from
overwork. The author justly remarks that [some of the leading cases on
which the psychologist commonly relies are little better than anecdotes, and
no more reliable than anecdotes usually are. It is a useful work to replace
these travellers' tales by modern examples which have been submitted
to careful study and analysis.
The second case is of more interest from the point of view of psychical
research. The subject, a female medium of sixteen years of age, developed
a mystical system of natural science in the course of her trances. The
development of her "controls" is carefully traced, but unfortunately no
details are given on one point of great interest. It is stated (p. 24) that
426 N. W. Thomas. [PART
she was able to personate remarkably well dead relatives and even persons
who had merely been described to her. Experiments in personation are
obviously complementary to Professor Hyslop's experiments in identifica
tion, and it is a matter for regret that the author did not see the importance
of such observations. There seems to have been nothing beyond secondary
personality in the trances. Among other phenomena glossolalie was
occasionally observed ; the language was unmistakably a modified French.
N. W. THOMAS.
The Hind of Man, by GUSTAV SPILLER. (Swan Sonnenschein, London,
1902, 8vo. pp. xiv. 552.)
Mr. Spiller has come to the conclusion that psychology is amazingly
backward and in this book sets forth the results of his efforts to advance
it. We learn in the preface that it is the outcome of the application of
the experimental method ; the author professes to have built up his fabric
by introspection ; he reviews incidentally the literature of normal psycho
logy. We can hardly be surprised that a writer who regards the science
of psychology as up to the present non-existent deals hardly with psychical
research and spiritualism (he does not distinguish between them), and as
a matter of fact, hia view seems to be that the whole thing is a superstition.
He says : " How are we to account for members of learned societies
seriously maintaining the objectivity of these pretences [of the Spiritualists] ?
The less said on the subject the better." And again : " There is no science
of spiritism . . . after the short experimental stage come undiluted
dogma and reckless speculation. Professors Wallace, Crooken, Lodge and
James illustrate what I am saying. Only the last of these is a psychologist
and he has never written anything bulky on the subject." After Mr.
Spillert unqualified condemnation of psychologists, as " philosophers, i.e.
those who have settled doctrines to begin with," it is a little difficult
to see on what grounds he thinks that psychologists are best fitted to
investigate spiritism. It is still less clear why no psychologist can l>e
an authority until he has written something bulky on the subject. Again
it is difficult to suppose that Mr. Spiller means anything by accusing Sir
Oliver Lodge and Sir William Crookes of reckless speculation after a
short experimental stage. If they have published nothing bulky, they
have not indulged in reckless speculation. Mr. Spiller's view that the
whole thing is a superstition makes his attitude towards Sir W. Crookes's
experiments rather enigmatic ; he regards them as "interesting." If
the whole thing is fraudulent, one might suppose that experiments
could only be interesting in proportion as the experimenter was deceived.
If there is an objective basis, on the other hand, it is rather hard on
members of learned societies that they may not say so without being
regarded as superstitious. More inexplicable still is Mr. Spiller's state
ment that "competent persons" should examine the whole subject. Mr.
Spiller is quite sure that it is all humbug ; this being so, one does
XLV.] Review. 427
not quite see what his competent person is to do. The remainder of
the work is not quite so revolutionary as Mr. Spiller imagines. The
line he takes is not always very clear and he would probably have
been more effective if he had confined himself to a narrower field.

G. R. CHESTERTON in the Daily Neivs says: "The only book I ever read which
really impressed me with a sense of the problems of the great poor populations of
London. . . . Gives any reader what he really needs—an awful, confounding,
asphyxiating sense of numbers and population."
The Guardian says: "We can heartily commend 'From the Abyss.' We have
never met with any more striking picture of the lives of the vast inarticulate multitude
or any more serious attempt to penetrate their aims and to sympathise with their
difficulties. The book, or booklet, is one which might be studied with profit by every
minister of religion, by every social reformer, and, indeed, by every member of the
leisured class."
The Pall .Mall Gazette s»ys : " It is an essay of singular and amazing power."

Human Personality
And its Survival of Bodily Death.
BY THE LATE FREDERIC W. H. MYERS.
2 VOLS. 8vo. IN PREPARATION.
This work aims at presenting in continuous form the bulk of the evidence,
experimental and otherwise, which points to human faculty operating below
the threshold of ordinary consciousness during the life of earth, and to human
faculty continuing to operate after the body's decay. Among the subjectt
treated of in this book are Alternating Personalities, Hysteria, Genius, Sleep,
Dreams, Hypnotism, Apparitions, Crystal-Gazing, Automatic Writing, Trance,
Possession, Ecstasy, Life after Death. The Author's object was to bring
within the purview of Experimental Psychology many topics as yet unfamiliar
to science, but nevertheless ripe, as he believed, for scienti6c experiment and
discussion.
It is hoped that the book will appear in the early autumn. The proofs of
the greater part of it had been revised by the Author, and it will be brought
out under the editorship of Dr. Richard Hodgson and Miss Alice Johnson.
