ii^hy the Universe Contains Planets"
THE FOURTH LECTURE
STRONOMY informs us that off in the stu­
pendous space that exists between Mars and
Jupiter there is a bevy of heavenly bodies
that are known as the Asteroids. Why and
how they originated have ever been debatable
items with Science. C The Asteroids appear
to be perfectly formed little planets, nicely
balanced in regard to one another so that they
do not collide, but the whole cluster of them
having an orbit around our sun precisely like
Mars, Earth, or Venus. The most popular
theory as to the existence of the Asteroids is that they represent frag­
ments of the primordial material that once composed twin planets
each the size of our earth, that revolved about one another while at
the same time the two of them kept up a yearly revolution about the
sun. For some unknown reason, ages bygone these twin planets
were pulled out of balance and collided with one another, causing a
heavenly holocaust in our solar system and leavening a vast cluster of
little orbs to keep up the journey through solar space.
The peculiar orbits of these Asteroids cast some doubt on the theory.
Be that as it may, here is the point of interest for us in referring to the
Asteroids for the moment—
Astronomy further informs us that whereas, viewed from the distance
of our earth, the Asteroids appear to be in a cluster or unit, each one
of them is truly hundreds of thousands of miles from its companions.
C Moreover, some of those capsule worlds are so small that a person
from the planet Earth could start off from a point on the equator of
one of them at seven o'clock in the morning, walk completely around
3
it, and be back at his starting-point by seven o’clock at night!
In other words, there are true planets whirling by themselves off in
the space between Mars and Jupiter as small as nine miles in diameter
—which would make them about thirty miles around their equators.
A person ambling along at only three miles an hour could easily en­
compass one of them between sunrise and sunset.
Whether or not each of these little cameo planets has an atmosphere, a
water system and vegetation like Earth— making animal or mortal
life possible— we have no means of knowing. Anyhow, the point is
unimportant to our present cause of reference.
If there are asteroids as small as nine miles in diameter, discernible
under certain conditions through modern telescopes, it is reasonable
to assume that there are some even smaller. So let us assume that we
located one asteroid that was a perfectly rounded sphere of rock only
one mile in diameter— a true heavenly body swinging about our sun
precisely like the earth— yet with its nearest asteroid companion as
far distant as our moon.
Let us suppose, to illustrate the idea we are presently to consider, that
upon such one-mile asteroid there is one pond of water as big as the
ordinary city reservoir from bank to bank, and a half-mile distant from
it there is just one tree— one venerable live oak, growing alone as the
tiny planet’s only exhibit of vegetation.
Let us suppose that all the rest of our baby planet is a mere orb of
smooth rock but because there are no other heavenly bodies close
enough to exert a magnetic pull, whatever exists upon the surface is
held there, ± ?
This baby planet turns about, similar to the movement of our earth,
so that it is favored with day and night, but otherwise it is a suspended
sphere of barren rock with naught to alter the monotony of its
surface but one pond and one tree.
There it is, whirling about the sun century after century— a gravita­
tional focus in Free Space for whatever comes into its vicinity.
Now let us stretch our imaginations one step further.
Let us suppose that wandering through Free Space are two immortal
but bodiless spirits.
They observe this isolated capsule planet with its one pond and one
tree, and pause to consider it.
Exactly how these two immortal spirits contrive to move through in­
terplanetary space, or what form they might represent to the eye, lack­
ing mortal bodies to enhouse them, we may— for purposes of our
4
exposition—ignore. But we should not ignore a distinguishable dif­
ference between them as spirits.
'fhe elder of them seems to be possessed of a lightning-like intelli­
gence, keen as to observation, swift in discrimination, devastatingly
logical in his deductions.
His companion-spirit, sexless like himself, is far from his equal in
quality of mentality. He is dull-eyed, slow of grasp, stupid and slug­
gishinhis reactions to what he observes in the star-worlds about them.
C If we want modern comparisons in the physical form, we might
liken the first spirit to an American business executive of the higher
altruistic type, and the second spirit to a mentally-moribund Russian
peasant of the times of Tolstoi.
Observing the pair from a discarnate survey-point ourselves, we might
decide that the more intelligent and wiser spirit had charge of his
stupidand brain-strapped companion in the capacity of mentor-guide,
ft Anyhow, five miles away from the baby planet with its lone pond
andlone tree they come to a state of rest and inspect it.
“At last we have found a heavenly body suitable to your purpose,"
theintelligent spirit announces to the other. "It is wholly uninhabit­
ed, it has perfect isolation, there is a pond for water and a tree for
shade, likewise the tree offers materials for fuel or bodily coverings
asyoutake unto yourself a body. Apparently we don’t need to search
anyfurther."
“W
hat happens to me now?" the second spirit asks.
‘Tmgoing to leave you upon the surface of this asteroid. You’re go­
ing to become intelligent by making your own experiments as you
liveyour lives upon it."
The second spirit has enough understanding to appear a bit dubious,
ft “You’re going to abandon me to solitary confinement on this ball
ofbarren rock? You couldn’t be so cruel!"
“Imnot abandoning you from cruelty, I’m abandoning you through
kindness. I’m giving you the chance to develop the same intelligence
—
through self-supervised trial and error experience upon this asteroid
—
that you’re constantly saying you admire so much in me. You’ll
develop that intelligence by having no one to lean on, merftally or
spiritually, but yourself, for awhile."
“But why should it be necessary?"
“By being thus isolated from all other performing spirits in the uni­
verse, you’ll begin to grasp a clearer picture of yourself. Your plight
w
ill make you think about yourself. It will turn your thoughts in-
5
ward upon yourself, what you are and what you want to become.”
“ It still seems merciless!”
“But if you kept on idling aimlessly about the universe with me, you’d
always be a mere spectator of Creation, your thoughts employed in
wonderments at what other spirits were doing or becoming. Being
isolated so, with a personal asteriod for your temporary residence,
you’ll only wonder about yourself, or the results you’re getting with
circumscribed asteroid possibilities.”
“Did you gain to your intelligence by being isolated at one time upon
such a lone asteroid?”
“ I most certainly did! It’s the Creator’s method with all spirits for de­
veloping the quality of the consciousness.”
“ But how shall I endure the tedium of my aloneness?”
“ When we get upon the surface of yonder asteroid I’ll show you how
to use the powers of your Thought to separate the aggressive mascu­
line traits and faculties in your character from the conserving feminine
traits and faculties. Then I’ll show you how to clothe each set of traits
with a body unto itself. These two bodies, in a manner of speaking,
shall keep each other company. Moreover, they shall be so fashioned
in their organic functions as to create other bodies, which when oc­
cupied by other wandering undeveloped spirits— or rather, half-spir­
its— shall be known as your Children. As these offspring increase
into a sizable company, they shall all provide an interrelated compan­
ionship.” i * i *
“Nevertheless, we shall all be left to a sort of solitary confinement
upon this empty asteroid!”
“Perhaps so! Still, what difference does it make? The whole uni­
verse is naught but a series of such asteroids, small or great in size.
Where you are has no significance. The only thing that counts is to
what extent you develop your intelligence. You really live within
yourself, not in some outward planetary location. Cornel Let’s go
upon the asteroid and see how a body made of the elements can be
materialized for you to live in, and used as your instrument for spirit­
ual experimenting!”

er areas.
|E have then, in this sim ple illustration, all the rudiments
making m ortality what it is.
We have asteroid, or planet, serving as the substance-
stage on which the spiritual dram a shall be played. W e
have pond and tree upon the planetary surface, identify­
ing certain areas as being separate and distinct from oth-
We have spiritual consciousness in disembodied form se­
lecting an orb of rock suspended in Free Space as a locality for per­
formance—but said perform ance being naught but the spiritual
motivation of physical substances, whether concerned with the per­
sonal body or the materials in its environment.
Here is the whole enigma of mortal exhibition reduced to simplest
components, t !* Z p
What does it matter that the nine-mile asteroid in a larger exhibition
is as big as the orb known as Earth? It is still isolation for the spirits
upon it.
What does it matter that in place of one pond five-hundred feet across,
there is a pond five thousand miles across and labeled an Ocean ?
What does it matter, that instead of one lone oak tree there are ten
million trees and a hundred million shrubs, which when segregated by
the interlaps of cleared spaces become identified as forests ?
What does it matter that instead of one moribund and brainstrapped
“peasant** arriving on such a planet in com pany with a Mentor-Guide,
there are Seven Thousand or two billion ?
The fundamental intent of it all still holds— that it is the nature of the
spiritual performance, and not the place of the performance, that fur­
nishes the profit from the knowing of the slightest feature in any of it.
C The “reality** or Mortality is actually the doing of things, the com­
mitting of acts that have their origins in spiritual decidings, through
the medium of material instruments and organisms.
Thus reduced to fundamentals, there is no basic philosophical differ­
encebetween lighting a cigarette and firing a galaxy. A n act is an act!
C The quantities of m aterials involved in consummation of the act
never alter the premise of the spirit-maneuvering. A nd the essence of
all spirit-maneuvering, in any location within the celestial universe
and in any act, from spanking a refractory young one to overturning
a dynasty, is to develop the never-ceasing expansion of the individual
consciousness to progressive realizations that the individual is but an
omnipotent Field of Force which can complete any action that spirit
can conceive.
7
If any of us here and now wanted to entertain a truly new idea, and
do some thinking that could really be termed original, it would con­
sist of this seeming paradox—
That volatile, self-motivating human spirits exist for a cosmic interval
in the forms of physical men and women, and go through all their
frictional displays of character one toward the other, to prove to them­
selves in the Ultimate that they have by no means been mere men and
women, but Fields of Force, capable of registering their eccentricities
on every last iota of energy in the universe.
T o put the matter in another way, each one of us is but a personalized
unit of omnipotent cosmic energy, and the things that we do and the
lives that we live are but exhibits of the degree to which we have
grasped this fact and motivated the organic performings of spirit ac­
cordingly. ±2* t9
T o say to ourselves, each one of us, *1 am not a Man, or 1 am not a
W om an,” but **1 am a Field of Force that at present, for reasons of its
own, is exhibiting in a physical organism in order to get its educative
quota of trial-and-error experimentings in this peculiar asteroid isola­
tion,*' is to throw a different light upon all mortal quandaries..
T o begin thinking of ourselves as something apart from our bodily
limitations is the first step in performing spiritually
Moreover, it is the first step toward grasping life s seeming complica­
tions for what they are: Machinations of Cosmos for making us more
acutely aware of ourselves as omnipotent energy units merely en-
housed in flesh to gain evaluations of ourselves in perspective.
Apparently we go on and on, expanding the potentialities of these
Fields of Force that are ourselves, indefinitely.
The mortal octave, in which a particular Field of Force is employed
at motivating a physical body upon an asteroid that is isolated from
all the other heavenly bodies, cannot be the only sequence of exercise
which this Force gets, for the simple and yet profound reason that its
educative experiences have a limit.
To say that this Force extinguishes merely because it exhausts all the
opportunities for performing afforded by an octave, is to contradict
the essence of the whole education.
Strictly speaking, there actually is an end to educative Thinking and
Profiting in this asteroid octave! When a human being reaches that
point in his earthly experiencing where no situation which he may
encounter or participate in, can add to his concreted wisdom or
perspicacity, and life on life is but a tiresome repetition of lessons
8
which he already knows by heart, he may begin to disintegrate tem­
peramentally from the sheer boredom of profitless duplications of
effort, t ? t ?
A Field of Force, in other words, must continually exercise itself in
some form that is knowable or it ceases to exist as a Field of Force.
C When a human being arrives at that state of consciousness, or
cosmic perception, wherein the sizes or numbers of things no longer
awe him but annoy him, and he perceives no difference between hav­
ing his name carved on a monument for future generations of nitwits
to gape at, and having it carved on a stone that five minutes later is
tossed in a chasm, he is reaching the end of whatever increments the
asteroid isolation possesses to confer on him.
To promise him— as modern theology so frequently does—that his
escape from this insufferable condition is to transfer to a bigger or
more beauteous asteroid where spiritual conditions are more har­
monious—meaning that they demand less personal energy expended
to live—only promises a still greater boredom.
Because he is promised a lesser energy-expenditure whereby to live,
his wisdom tells him that he is being promised a lesser exercise for his
Field of Force, therefore he is being invited into a greater display of
self-extinguishment.
What the True Wise Man— who has come to the end of all possible
profits from the asteroid octave— really wants, is an opportunity to
exercise himself as a Field of Force in a manner that does not forever
keep him objective in his relationship to Things.
He wants to have done with objective Things—which after all, he has
found to be all alike excepting for differences in bulk and pattern.
C. When he has learned every lesson that Things of bulk and pat­
tern have to impart to him, he is then ready for exercisings of Con­
sciousness that are more concerned with projecting Things— that is,
designing and creating Things as an octave of experience in and of
itself—than in observing Things or being the reactive victim of their
properties. i * i y
9
RRIVING at this status of Consciousness in regard to
Things, such a Wise Man is, of course, both willing and
eager to depart permanently an octave where any identi­
fication of his particular Field of Force is dependent in
any way upon his physical enhousements.
That, however, is quite another treatise. What a later
generation of philosophers will come to recognize and preach, is that
Man as both theology and biology know him is but a temporary freak
of spirit manifestation, that the Field of Force that is labeled Man
— when it physically incarnates and isolates itself upon an asteroid—
is but exercising one of its many ways of employing itself for the
discovery of its fecundities, and that the asteroid octave or three-
dimensional world of Things is but a primary experimentation of that
Force. ijr
Grasp this Idea actually, and life holds few rigors!
An asteroid or a planet, any type of heavenly body anywhere in the
universe, is merely a gigantic billiard ball suspended like Mohammed's
Coffin in interstellar space. It cannot fall because there is nowhere
for it to fall. It can collide with other planets as their mutual mag­
netism draws them together, but the distances between them are so
gigantic that it very rarely happens.
An illustration often employed in these Scripts conveys a faint ideaof
what those distances are. If you designate an orange to represent the
sun, then the earth would be represented by a pea forty feet away.
The nearest star to such sun would be another orange, two miles dis­
tant!
C Here then, rotating in free space—which is a way of designating
limitless emptiness— are tens of thousands of such planet billard-balls,
from forty feet to two miles distant from each other in our analogy.
C Viewed from an abstract point off in space—granted they couldbe
seen— they would be but a cluster of such balls rotating everlastingly
in eternal void.
Looking at them, you could say: “So!— that assembly of little balls
is all that there is to the universe! Actually it cannot even be located,
because outside of it there is nothing but incomprehensible emptiness.”
C It is a queer thought to think: that being unable to locate our uni­
verse because there is nothing in eternal emptiness to locate it BY, we
truly do not know where it is—and that therefore, in a manner of
speaking, it is actually nowhere!
A s we draw closer to the cluster of planet billiard-balls, and even more
10
inamong them, we can locate the position of one ball from the other.
Furthermore, we discover ourselves surrounded by so many of them
that our brains cannot grasp them and we begin to grow confused.
([Fundamentally however, that is all the universe is: a cluster of
suspended billiard-balls— and among them, or on them, Conscious
Life operates.
HESE planet billiard-balls are not composed of ivory, of
course, but of different kinds of metal and stone. As
to metal, iron predominates. As to stone, the greater
content of the planets seems to be common granite.
Barring the fact that they are made of fused iron and
granite, however, and that they seem to be enormous of
size only because we are accustomed to think of our bodies ,as so
small in comparison with them, they are still nothing but little spheres
with smooth surfaces, each one surrounded by a little puff of steam
which is a watery atmosphere.
Changes in the temperatures of these atmospheres due to the radiating
heat of suns, produce winds. These winds erode the smooth iron-
granite surfaces of these billiard-balls and powderize them. This
powderized iron and granite falls back or comes to rest upon the sur­
face of the balls when the winds have produced it and is identified as
soil. In this soil, vegetation sprouts and trims the barren surface of
each ball—so that its actual barrenness is screened. This vegetation
multiplies into forests, jungles, morasses. All of these are but decora­
tions and festoons which hide the fact that the planet is nevertheless,'
a smooth billiard-ball, forever rotating in eternal emptiness.
Ifwe could halt ourselves off in that eternal emptiness and inspect this
cluster of rotating balls, we would doubtless exclaim: “So that’s the
universe over which the creatures within it make such a pother! Just
a cluster of free-moving balls, going nowhere because there is no­
where to go-—except the course of their circular orbits! What a
business to get excited about! If a boy took a great handful of marbles
fromhis pocket, and tossed them high in the air, and conditions were
such that they did not fall to the ground but stayed in the air forever,
weshould have the whole universe on a minute scale.”
Grasping this picture of the universe, and wondering why anybody
should get particularly excited about it, seeing that it exists “ nowhere”
that is capable of J>eing located excepting by the spherical units com­
posing it, we turn to another concept. . . .
11
ONSIDERING the size or iron-granite bulk of any one of
these billiard-balls, Man is an infinitesimal upright-walk­
ing insect who confines himself to the surface of one of
the balls known as Earth.
The sun has made temperatures, and the temperatures
have made winds, and the winds have made erosions,
and the erosions have made soil; and the soil has permitted vegetation
to grow and festoon the surface of the billiard-ball known as Earth
so that the human minutiae upon it forget in their scurrying to and
fro that they are confined nevertheless to the surface of a ball rotating
eternally in emptiness.
The strange part of all this human minutiae is that each one is so
wrapped up and concerned in his own personal experiences, as he
scurries in and out amid the vegetation-festoons and breeds this and
that antagonism with the microscopic creatures like him, that he really
doesn't care that he is playing his role upon a rotating ball in eternal
emptiness. Jfc*
Truly, his own consciousness—or sense of being alive and performing
— is everything to him. Even his condition in eternal emptiness is
secondary in importance to this sense of being alive, self-motivating,
and organically performing.
He does not know generally, that this sense of self-realization is some­
thing that doesn't perish, no matter what happens to the instrument by
which he gets his effects. If one instrument is smashed, or becomes
worn out, this sense of self-realization moves out of it and awaits its
chance to get into another instrumentality as it is produced by copu­
lation of the male and female of his species.
It is a condition of his sense of self-realization, that he must consider
his career in the one instrument, or the organism he utilizes at the
moment of such consideration, as the only career that he will ever
know. This makes for a desperate sincerity in pursuing the career in
the current instrument.
If it were generally known and accredited that self-realization is per­
petual and non-extinguishable, the consciousness might become in­
dolent or lethargic and say, “Why try to exert myself for perpetua­
tion of my species, advancement of mortal principle, or social im­
provement? A s I live forever, anyhow, and have selection of
tens of thousands of instruments and organisms in future, self­
effort in any one of them—-to approximate the condition known as
Personal Achievement— is an expensive silliness.** So it is presumed
12
that one span of consciousness, in one organism , is all that is to be
allotted, and therefore the “hum an** spirit is galvan ized to m ak e the
most of it.
Therefore, generation upon generation, age upon age, aeo n u p o n
aeon, these human minutiae experience all the geograph ical an d so cial
predicaments that the planet billiard-ball is capable o f presen tin g.
The day comes when this functioning o f C on sciou sn ess, o r self-
realization, alters. . . .
Scurrying hither and yon on the su rface o f an en d lessly -rotatin g
billiard-ball suspended in em ptiness, is perceived for w h at it is.
Tve gained all the self-realization adroitness that it is p o ssib le fo r m e
to gain as a creature of environm ent,** it decides— m ean in g a self-
motivating Thing meeting objectively w ith ad ven tu res on the b illiard-
ball’s outer surface, furnished, equipped, an d festo o n ed w ith a n in­

my self-performance I*m going to be the su b jectiv e F ield o f F o rc e
that makes contribution to the variety o f exh ib its in th e m ate rialistic
museum that is the Universe.**
It is not a change of habitat for the C o n scio u sn ess.
It is a change in nature!
12-a
F COURSE, ordinary men and women, going about
their three-meal-a-day affairs in this localizedworld, have
a difficult time sensing what such a change in the nature
of Consciousness means. As aforesaid, they cry to them­
selves: “What an insufferable existence, to stay in one
' place and never make one physical motion throughout
all Eternity!’* They are so accustomed to movement of their physical
vehicles* being Life, that anything else stacks up as death. They do
not sense, because it is too fine a point in thinking, that even at the
present moment, while enhoused in physical bodies, their sentient spir­
its are not of themselves moving; they are staying in one place within
the bodily enhousement and it is the bodily enhousement that under­
goes the phenomenon of Movement in a three-dimensional world.
They do not sense, either, that granted they get a sense of spiritual
movement by being enhoused in a body that moves, they still are go­
ing nowhere insofar as their terrestrial universe is concerned.
If they could transport their observing minds off to a geometrical point
in free Space and discern the billiard-ball universe in the manner
previously implied, they would simply see the cluster of balls rising
and falling, rising and falling, rising and falling—always falling only
to rise again. The universe would appear precisely like the balls in
the hands of the competent juggler in vaudeville. No matter what
angle such a discarnate person observed the billiard-ball universe from,
the orbits of the stars, suns, and planets would simply be a rising and
falling, or swinging in a circle. But regarded abstractly as a whole,
the cluster as a cluster would be motionless. It would be going no­
where, because there is nowhere for it to go. The whole composition
would be mere spherical energy, exhibiting in eternal and measure­
less Nothingness. And right at that point, the thinking of the mate­
rial physicist stops and the thinking of the metaphysician begins.
Where is this Eternal Nothingness, in which the billiard-ball universe
exists suspended with nothing to mark its beginning or end?
When we try to think of the proposition that it cannot be located out­
side of itself, we come to the proposition that after all, it is only a sort
of mental concept in Divine Consciousness. And that is precisely
what our Mentors from Loftier Octaves try to tell us that it is!
On the other hand, the nearer we move in toward the billiard-ball
cluster, pass through it with the moving balls all about us, and finally
come to rest on the planet Earth— all illusions of abstraction have
gone, and, as we so often put it, materiality has become so terribly
12-b
real that being divorced from it, even for the period between the
physical enhousements, fills the spirit-soul with a sort of terror.
The secret of this terror is, that any detachment from such reality
seems to lose the spirit-soul a sense of its own identity, or rather, it
loses the standards by which it commonly preserves its sense of Self*
Awareness! .£*
Itdoesn’t grasp that there should be constant periods when the Spirit-
soul should withdraw from materiality in order to preserve the stand­
ards by which it keeps its sense of spiritual identity as well. It doesn’t
see that spirit-soul is identified, not by what it does—in the material
sense of motion—but by what it IS, or what capabilities of thinking
it has developed through experiences with, and in, material fopns.
Whenit is measuring by material standards, close in among thebilliard-
balls, or down upon the surface of one of them, it wants that condi­
tion to maintain permanently. Commonly this desire is called Self-
Preservation. Yet such is its inconsistency, or confusion of erudition,
that even with the desire to have the material standards maintain
permanently, it fiercely fights the notion that after a time in the ab­
stract spiritual status it will return unerringly to material and form
to obtain more education.
We can only explain it by postulating that spirit-soul, like energy in
Matter, tends to obey the law of movement in one direction, or main­
tenance of one condition, till stopped or diverted by some superior
force, Jjr &
We shall go into this deeper in a subsequent Lecture.
INE out of ten people have an unhallowed fright at Death
because from the start of their organic performance on
this planet billiard-ball they have never understood either
the character of Life or its purposes.
They have never had their attention called to the uni­
verse in perspective. C They have let themselves be­
come so completely enmeshed, smothered, or bewitched with the in­
finite materialisms of environment— the furnishings and festoonings
hiding the original sterilities and barrenness of the billiard-ball’s sur­
face— that conscious existence becomes nothing in their thinking and
considering, but the period of their frantic scurryings to and fro as
organisms amid the furnishings and festoons.
In all of it there is similarity to a person’s visiting the Museum of
Natural History in New York City. He goes in at nine and comes out
at five. Throughout the eight hours he wanders through hall after
hall of natural specimens, past case after case of metal, mineral, and
biological exhibits. “While I am among the exhibits, I am alive, says
he, “because I view and examine them. But the moment I depart the
museum I am dead, because I no longer view or examine them.’’
If we met such a person in current society, sincerely holding such
ideas, we would term him psychopathic.
Yet those are precisely the ideas that millions of us hold in regard to
the museum that is the cluster of planet billiard-balls rotating end­
lessly in eternal emptiness.
Suppose, to impress the notion further, the person in the New York
Museum enjoyed himself fairly comfortably up till three o’clock.
Thereafter, as the hands of the clock moved around toward four, sup­
pose he began to exhibit uneasiness. As the clock-hands moved in­
exorably around the dial toward five— and closing-time—suppose that
he became possessed of a frantic terror. Suppose that an observant
attendant asked if he were ill. And suppose our person answered,
“ No, I’m frightened half sick at the prospect of what is due to happen
to me when the clock-hands reach five. You see, I shall cease to exist
the moment I can no longer wander through these rooms and examine
the exhibits.”
Would the attendant not be inclined to put in a call for an ambulance
and guards?
Or perhaps he might argue with our person in this guise:
“ I’ve seen you here every day for a month, have I not?”
”Yes, I’ve been here every day for a month. The first day that I
foil*
j the place and started looking at the exhibits w as the date of
birth!*
Oh, i
^ was, was it? Y et som ething like thirty times youV e seen the
^ of the clock draw near m useum closing-time, haven't you?
You've gone out into the street and left the m useum to be locked
through the night. W hat I’m getting at is, you've never failed to re-
tU
m and resume your inspection of the exhibits, have you, when nine
o’clockrolled around on each succeeding m orning?”
“Yes, somehow or other I've alw ays gotten back in here.”
“Then you couldn't really have died at each closing-time, could you ?
Because if you'd truly died, how could you have been on hand to
resume your inspection next m orning?”
HE "death” which the hum an minutiae assum e that they
are called to "d ie” between each visitation to the
museum that is the furnished and festooned surface of
the suspended barren billiard-ball, is an interval for mere
spiritual contemplation of w hat has been viewed or
examined throughout the previous “ day's” visit. i
f
f
CPeople who “ fight the doctrine o f earthly return,” declaring that
under no circumstances would they care to repeat on life’s experi­
ences, are truly saying: “ H aving visited for one celestial day the
Egyptian Room of the m useum , I've seen it all. Don't talk to m e of
goingback and viewing all the rest of it!”
“Ah, but you haven't seen it all,” som e divine attendant might protest.
“You’ve only seen the Egyptian R oom . You haven't visited the
Grecian Room, the Italian Room , the French Room , or som e forty
other rooms, all containing different wonders of exhibits. U ntil
you’ve seen all that the m useum holds, how can you decide whether
you like it or not?”
“The rooms are all alike! Besides, in the Egyptian R oom today there
was a man who made faces at me, and a small boy who popped pea­
nuts down my neck when I w asn’t looking.”
“But the rooms are not all alike! A nd besides, because a m an m akes
faces at you and a small boy pops peanuts down your collar, that has
little to do with your inspecting the whole m useum as a m useum , or
theprofit that is yours from beholding w hat’s been gathered there.”
“No, I’ve ‘lived my life' in visiting the Egyptian Room . Because I've
seen the exhibits in the Egyptian Room , I'm am ply equipped to go
■ : 13
forth after closing time and lay claim to a knowledge of all wonders
in Cosm osI"
“ But you said previously that you were only alive when you were in
the museum and examining its exhibits. Y ou’re terrified at the ap­
proach of five o’clock and dread the contemplative interval till nine
tomorrow morning. Yet here you’re now telling me that Life is the
business of seeing only the Egyptian Room. I’m declaring to you
that the phase of consciousness known as mortality doesn’t truly
terminate till you’ve visited A LL the rooms and become intimately
acquainted with every exhibit that’s available!**
There is sense in this analogy.
If the truth could only be known, the conventional Fear of Death
is not half so much discomfiture over the prospect of being turned
out into the street of the universe to await the reopening of the mortal
museum in the morning of a fresh life, as it is a colossal self-pity over
the presentiment that mayhap all the energy one has put forth to
arrive at, and spend the life-day inspecting, the Egyptian or Italian or
French or American Room of the planet-museum, has been wasted.
One has not seen all the things that existed to be seen, even in the
Egyptian Room; so the desire for self-preservation is a mania, that
the inspection may be thorough and complete.
Think it over!
Whenever the complications and quandaries of life pile up till they
seem to be unbearable, withdraw off in space hypothetically and look
at the universe as a cluster of planet billiard-balls, rotating in eternal
emptiness, every ball a museum. The manner of the personal going-
out and coming-in to such museum is not of consequence.
What IS of'consequence is the fact that graduation from the billiard-
ball status of located Consciousness is not the procedure till intimacy
with all the Rooms and exhibits in the planet-museum is complete.
Then comes the next phase, or octave, of Consciousness:—
Constructing museums, subjectively, in one’s own right, because the
functioning of the consciousness has altered.
14
ARTH-LIFE, as men and women during this coming
Aquarian Age may finally grasp the true import of it,
does not mean one brief incursion into one body—or as
our recent metaphor had it, a one-day visit to one of the
rooms of the mundane museum—and then a passing on
to higher qualities or functions of Consciousness. if
dEarth-Life means the objective consciousness which endures
and exercises while the spirit employs itself in any form amid the
cluster of the planet billiard-balls, and during the interval in eternal
Time that it spends in viewing the exhibits objectively in ALL of the
rooms of this mundane museum.
To lose One’s organism for a time and not be able to exert a mental-
muscular effort on materials, truly means no more than withdrawing
intothe upper chamber of an earthly house, disrobing to the birth-suit,
and donning a different array of garments.
True, there is a period of nakedness between the putting off of the
first costume and the putting on of the second. But no one is so
foolish as to argue that self-awareness ceases because the body is
naked. And the same should be said for the soul! Neither does
anyone fear loss of identity to,his fellows or relatives because he dis­
appears into the chamber in one costume and comes forth clad in
another. if if
Earth-Life, by the same token, might be termed the period of spirit-
confinement among the billiard-ball cluster of the planetary universe
and during which time all the different costumes of bodies, species,
and races, are worn as suits of clothes.-
And pulling the Mind off to a geometrical point in Eternal Emptiness
and viewing the ensemble of materiality from the objective viewpoint,
does give the seemingly poignant enigmas of mortality the aspects
of relieving silliness.
To understand life in order to discard fear of death, one must under­
stand that the Creator had to prqject the original billiard-ball cluster
inorder that the human minutiae might learn to grasp what objectivity
was in the first place.
None of us could enter the creative-subjective phase of Reality with­
out knowing what it means for Consciousness to function as a thing
APART from materials. ,.r ,
Is the thought prodigious, and not a little monstrous?
If it means very little to you now, don’t worry about it, for as addi-
15
tional experience and study brings greater awareness, you will
it all as easily as you did your “ A B C V ’ l graiP
OW pulling the Mind off to a point in Eternal Empties
not only gives many of the present enigmas of mortality
the aspects of silliness but it means to the true philoso­
pher and seeker after wisdom, that his thinking about the
materiality and composition of the universe undergoes
radical alteration. Pulling the Mind off to a point in
Eternal Emptiness would present a universe that mortal intelligence
in its present state of unfoldment and development— probably couldn’t
recognize. The human mind, in other words, couldn t know where it
was, or what its condition was. Therefore— queer as the proposition
may strike you for the moment— it wouldn t altogether know what
it was, itself! Do you think this reads absurdly ? You won t in a mo­
ment when I give you a suggestion of the physics of the thing.
As aforesaid, we get our ideas of what we are, as men and women -
or freely-deciding spirits each enhoused in a physical mechanism
because of the comparisons we make with environment and the ob­
jects and furnishings thereof, in which we have found ourselves since
birth. We get these ideas through the spiritual reactions from our
physical senses as those physical senses receive in turn the effects
from some sort of collision with the furnishings and objects of such
environment. &
In the primordial state of Spirit we have Consciousness, true. But
it is Consciousness that is capable of recognitions when, as, and if it
enters into an area where materials or objects exist. These recogni­
tions make Spirit aware of the literality of such m aterials, and when
they have taken pattern, Spirit is likewise aw are o f their peculiarities
of form— which it describes as objects.
But never forget throughout this whole course o f instruction that
whereas Consciousness is capable of recognitions of materials and ob­
jects when, as, and if it enters into an area where they abound, the
real effect of the recognitions is the surprised realization that such
Spirit is a separate entity, viewing them !
In this simple proposition, we might say, we have the real “ W hy?”
of the universe, and the reasons for its celestial bodies— as will later
be expounded.
This raises the question: W as the universe made for Man, or Man
for the universe?
16
is a great caste of devout folk— whose sentiments in the mat-
^can by no means be disregarded—who claim that any contention
r? the universe’s being made particularly for Man’s residence and
°rofit is both bombastic and impious. Knowing something of the
fundamentals of Astronomy, they declare that it is well-nigh absurd
tothink of the starry universe in its immensity, as being brought into
existence for so puny and insignificant an entity as Man.
What such good folk are overlooking, is a correct interpretation of
what Man is himself. They accept that Man is the physical minutia
that they perceive running to and fro on the surface of this particular
planet at present. If they once got it through their heads that Man in
his physical organism is one thing, and that Man in his spiritual poten­
tialities and fecundities is quite another, they might regard the
hypothesis that the universe is made for its occupants and residents,
as less bombastic than they dream.
The new concepts are, that Man is merely Spirit in a peculiar primary
state of Form-Recognitions, through which, or by means of which,
he slowly but inexorably attains to colossal unfoldment. Of course,
as he attains to such colossal unfoldment, he ceases being Man as the
world now regards him. We may safely leave this phase of discus­
sion to another time and lecture.
Consciousness, 1 said, is capable of recognitions of materials and ob­
jects—a term meaning Environment— when it has moved in amongst
them and commenced to receive a bombardment of reactions, or ex­
perience a series of collisions, from and with them.
The instant that such Consciousness gives the slightest sign of taking
note that such things are happening, or moves in the slightest degree
to counteract the effects of them, we say that Consciousness is “ func­
tioning!” ±3*
Here again, is a stupendously important point!
Thousands of people, becoming introduced to Basic Wisdom in its
metapsychical aspects, are prone to cry: “ You speak of Conscious­
ness and Functioning Consciousness. But wherein can there be a
difference? How can you possibly have Consciousness without its be­
ing somehow in a state of functioning? If it isn’t functioning, how
can it be Consciousness?”
We have to answer these pupils: You went to sleep last night,
didn’t you? The act of Going to Sleep was one of losing recognition
of environment and the materials and objects that went to make it up.
You slept for eight hours. This morning you ‘awakened.* That is
17
to say, you resumed recognition of the materials and object
vironment. Now you probably wouldn’t be so bold as to * ° en
*
while you were asleep last night, you were actually dead! j?
not die last night when you fell asleep, and return to life this morn^
when you awakened. So therefore, in some form or other, you
have been conscious in the interim. But it was not a state of Func.
tioning Consciousness.” Some psychologists would term it Focused
Consciousness, but I hope to prove to you that Focused Conscious-
ness can be quite something else, in explaining later the difference be.
tween the Sub-Conscious and Ab-Conscious.
An easy way to think of ourselves as we were on coming into the
planetary universe as primordial spirit, is to imagine that all of us w
ere
indeed alive but in a state of Original Sleep. Entering into environ­
ments of planetary materials and forms, each of us gradually awak­
ened” to a sense of form and substance. And as we awakened to a
sense of form and substance, we likewise awakened to a sense of our
own identities. Consciousness, in other words, functioned, and
insofar as the earth-world was concerned, we became living souls.
C The illustration or metaphor is crude at the moment, but let it serve
till we bring up a better.
SAID that if Mind were capable of transporting itself
off to a geometric point in Eternal Emptiness— where it
could regard the physical universe objectively—that it
wouldn’t know where or what it was. But there would
be still another reason why it wouldn’t know. Granted
that Mind carried with it for such an errand of inspec­
tion, all its sensory attributes, the nature of the physical universe is
such that Mind simply couldn’t function in recognitions off at such
a point. Granted that Mind could make the hypothetical trip to a
detached point in Absolute Space, item number one of its circum­
scriptions would be, that it couldn’t SE E ! Understand now, I’m not
referring to the blindness that might come by reason of not having
physical eyeballs to see WITH. W e’re looking for the moment at
Nature’s end of the equation.
Mind at a geometrical point in Free Space that was absolute, would be
unable to realize its objectivity to the universe or that the universe
was off there in a billiard-ball cluster a couple of hundred trillion
miles to the northwest— because no Light would reach it from that
universe, to identify it as to pattern or location, in a form that Mind
18
i j it Light only becom es recognizable— takes the incandes-
c0uld adn^ * tuat is i— when it has som e sort of physical surface
diffused.
S g incandescence which man in his earthly state calls Light, is a sort
of etheric-thought vibration that travels forth from its causation- .
ooint, in what physicists describe as w aves. But we m ust remember
Sat these waves are but Motion— or, to use the more scientific term
again, Energy! They are as invisible as the radio waves carrying the
music of a jazz-orchestra into your home in the evening, unless they
can collide with the dust m otes in atmosphere. In this collision the
miracle of Diffusion is performed. But here again we are up against
enigmas. Diffusion only m eans that having collided with motes in
atmospheric dust, they are thereby rendered into a form that makes
them intelligible for a second collision: on the retina of the physical
eyeball. In the instant of this second collision, Functioning Con­
sciousness picks them up, or transfers their phenomena to the brain
and thence to Mind.
Mind thereupon exclaims: “ Light!** It thinks it is recognizing in­
candescence objectively. Really, it is exclaiming: “ I am aware that
1exist, in that I can perceive the phenomena of the etheric-thought
waves in their peculiarities of performance!**
Never for an instant forget that in all types of collisions and reactions
which Mind is encountering throughout the whole universe, it is first
and foremost thinking in terms of identification of Itself!
Such point being registered, we can reason backwards in this fashion:
For me to know myself, I m ust have the receptive organism to know
when etheric-thought w aves are coming in along the optic nerves from
the retina of my eye. For the etheric-thought waves to come in along
such optic nerves, they m ust impinge on retina. For them to im­
pinge on retina, they m ust become diffused by collision with dust
motes. For such dust motes to exist and receive such diffusing impacts,
there must be atmosphere for them to hang in. A t a point in
absolute free space there would be no atmosphere, hence no dust
motes, hence no collision with the etheric-thought waves, hence no
phenomena that could be recognized as incandescence, hence no
identifications of the marvel known as Light, hence no identification
of the distant billiard-ball universe.’*
Mind outside of atomic conditions then, would hnd itseir m Absolute
Dark. ,
And Absolute Dark is darkness beyond concept.
19
0 , the human mind has to move in among the sta
constellations, planets, and asteroids, to get any f ^
approximation of what the universe of celestial ©rU^S
enly bodies is like. And it has to view them from^K
environment of some sort of atmosphere holding due
motes. Otherwise it is in Stygian Dark, and for all in.
tents and purposes might as well be suspended like Mohammed’s Cof.
fin in the center of some earthly bank-vault at midnight.
To arrive therefore, at a concept or idea of what it would mean to
Consciousness not to have any universe of heavenly bodies on—or in
—which to exist and perform, we might ask ourselves what sort of
individual would result, who happened to be born inside a sealed bank-
vault, or deep underground where no form of incandescence of any
sort ever penetrated, and although possessed of all his senses other­
wise, had to grow to maturity in such surroundings. True, he might
gain to a sense of materials by touch, but what he gained would
only be concepts of the steel sides of the vault or of the basalt walls
of the underground cavity. To such an individual, the world would
simply mean so many square feet of smooth metal or rough rock in
any one of four directions. And he would be prepared to fight you,
or at least call you an imbecile, if you informed him that the world in
any aspect was otherwise. ,
It is after the nature of Consciousness to conceive of reality accord­
ing to the pattern of its sensations in contacting materials or forms of
substance. And Functioning Consciousness never exceeds in any
particular, the particulars of the materials or forms of substance with
which it has had sensory contact.
To put it in another way, there is nothing in your mind— nor can
there ever be anything go into your mind— unless it arrives there by
the prior process of contacting it sensorily or externally, either to the
moment in this present earthly career, or in careers of the past which
you recall in the pattern of memories or instincts.
The universe consists of planets, in our particular case, because plane­
tary bodies provide the stage on which all environments may be set,
by which primordial Consciousness gradually evolves through expe-
riencings into Functioning Consciousness.
Spirit attains to Functioning Consciousness by having careers in en­
vironments provided by materials and patterns of substances known
as objects. And, incidentally, this seems a good place to interject the
thought—or rather, the explanation— that when we speak of “old’*
20
uls or “ young” so u ls, w e m e an le n g th s o f tim e o v er w hich giv en
Spirit Particles h av e b e en th u s aw a k e n in g to a se n se o f th em selv es
in such environm ents an d p a tte rn s o f su b stan ce s.
Consciousness as a primordial form of spiritual expression is eternal
—meaning endless both w ays from the present. But new particles
of Spirit, proceeding out of it to gain proficiency in self-awareness, are
entering into the formal worlds and the substance-environments, all
the while. If this were not so, then the whole universe, spiritually
as well as radioactively considered, would run down. And it is not
running down. Science declares that it is speeding up, or ever-ex­
panding and ever-increasing!
lY PO TH ETIC A LLY , however, for purposes of gaining
to this G reat Intelligence about the purposes of Sub­
stance and form in Matter, let us try to get a notion of
the immensity of the universe and the nature of its
composition, by assum ing that we do move in among
the billiard-balls and have atmosphere provided us, so
that etheric-thought w aves reaching our locality m ay give us identifi­
cation points, or markers, for planetary incandescence. Further, let
us assume that we move in am ong the billiard-balls to the exact point
in Space that is now occupied by our earth, in the heart of our solar
system. But suppose w e conceive of this mighty thing Jiappening:
C Suppose we conceive that having arrived squarely at the geometric­
al point in intersellar space— or space that is located in the center o f
the star-clusters— that is now featured by our Earth, a titanic catar
clysm suddenly yanks the Earth out from under us and converts it to a
gas that can neither be seen, smelled, touched, nor tasted. Suppose
we conceive that this gas passes off into interstellar space without in­
juring us in the slightest, but lets our atmosphere remain behind. In
other words, for purposes of getting across an idea, suppose that
in the twinkling of an eye the earth as a material-globe suddenly
vanished but left us suspended in the midst of its incandescence-mak­
ing atmosphere, exactly where it had been.
How then, would the universe appear to us?
The result should not be difficult to conceive. W e go out under the
skies on a clear autumn evening and see the vast vault of the starry
heavens suspended above our heads. It has the appearance of a
gigantic blue bowl turned upside down, with the heavenly bodies
tacked here and there on the surface of the inside. But it only appears
21
to be an inverted bowl to us because we are standing on a flat D
]
intersecting this horizontalized half-sphere of sky.
If the earth-planet were to be suddenly yanked from beneath our feet
leaving us suspended in its envelope of atmosphere where it had been
a moment before, there would be no bowl-effects— turned upside
down, right side up, or any other way.
We should simply be suspended in Great Space, and all about us, no
matter in which direction we looked, we should see the immovable
fireflies of stars, suns, planets, and asteroids. We too, in such a plight,
would be but entities in free Space— suspended in Nothingness, or
No-Thingness— and fated to remain there throughout all eternal tim
e.
How far away from each other the immovable fireflies might be, w
e
should have small means of knowing. We should have nothing by
which to measure them, for we should have nothing with which to
compare them.
Always recall that measurement is but compare-ment. We get the
length of a thing by comparing it with the length of a foot-rule, a yard­
stick, or a distance of terrain that is accepted scientifically as being a
Mile. Jfcjr
Those immovable fireflies— or billiard-balls, as you prefer might be
tiny candle-flares twinkling a quarter-mile away, or they might be
heavenly bodies a thousand times more powerful than our sun but set
so far distant that they seem but candle-flares.
If we should ask ourselves how thickly they are likewise suspended
in free Space, again we should be at a loss, because we should have
naught with which to compare the space that we would measure as
to contents. ±jr jfc*
A planet, like Earth, therefore, is again absolutely essential to Con­
sciousness in order that it may arrive at estimates of measures and
distances. Without it we should be as much at a loss for the per­
formance of thinking as we now are when our geometry teacher says:
“ I put here a point in free space. Where is it?** A t once you as
pupil demand: “ But I must have some other point, or points, by
which to locate it I** Lacking any such points, no location can be
arrived at, therefore there is no such thing as one point and none
other in free Space. It would be unthinkable because it couldn’t be
located.
We locate the sun, the moon, the various stars and constellations,
at the present time, because we determine their positions in relation
to Earth. With Earth snatched away, we are utterly at a loss to tell
22
uere these heavenly bodies are, exceptin g as w e perceive their rela-
Ynships to each other. E v en so, the actual distances m ean nothing.
}s°the sun a m ere fiery billiard-ball or orange, with the earth as a
planet a mere pea forty feet a w a y ? O r shall w e say that the sun and
earthare 92 million m iles ap art an d containing their present relation­
ships of m ass?
Today, having an earth-planet tw enty-six thousand m iles or so around
itscircumference, w e thus h av e a m easu rin g stick. W e likewise, as per­
sons dwelling upon its outer su rface, h ave an average height o f five
feet and seven inches an d an av erage w eight o f 150 pounds. S o again
we take those m easurem ents a s stan dards— at least in our subcon­
scious thinking. H ow big is a th ing? Or, how sm all is a thing?
Well, how much larger or heavier is it than the height or w eight o f
our physical bodies? O r how m uch shorter or lighter is it than the
height or weight o f our ph ysical bodies ?
So it doesn't m ake the slightest difference to C on sciousness in its ex­
pansion of function, w hether a planet or a universe is great or sm all.
Everything is reckoned in proportion to the m ass or the size o f the
individuals doing the perceiving.
Asking ourselves— with such thoughts in m ind— how thickly the
heavenly bodies are strew n throughout free Space, w e do get an
answer. But it has to be an an sw er that uses the earth-planet for a
measure-stick. So w e get this— a n d it is scientifically accurate—
Suppose you subtract a sphere out o f universal Space— or isolate it—
that is the exact size o f the plan et Earth. U se that for your Space-
measure. Or to put it another w a y : su ppo se that our planet Earth
were hollow in its inside and consisted only o f a great glass shell, som e
eigfyt thousand m iles in diam eter.
Well, free interstellar Space is populated with planets to an extent
comparable with tw enty tennis-balls floating around prom iscuously
in the interior of such glass v e sse l!
And I mean tennis-balls— o f the sam e size that you use on your
tennis-court on Saturday half-holidays.
Twenty of them!
