PSYCHIC EVOLUTION
OR some years now the idea that the human race is on the
F verge, even in the midst, of a great change, has been gaining
popular currency. This theory is by no means limited to politi-
cal prophets and workers for an international order. Nearly every
branch of thought has its version of the world of tomorrow. While
sober scientists are predicting that specialized progress will revolu-
tionize still further our present ways of life, there are scores of exotic
cults which anticipate more miraculous alterations in the future, and
are now attempting to gather supporters for their particular program
of social reform. It is as though the whole world were in labor,
utterly confused as to the meaning of the physical and moral suffer-
ing of all humanity, and longing, with the intensity born of despera-
tion, to believe that, somehow, the millennium is not far off.
The scientiï¬c and other serious literature of the age is full of de-
scriptions of this unrest, but little or no explanation is offeredâ€”at
least, no explanation that is at all adequate to the great psychological
upheaval before us. The fact of change is readily acknowledged,
but its meaning remains obscure. It is for this reason that the ancient
Theosophical view of human evolution is here presented.
N 0 special claim to authority is made for the doctrines that will
be offered in explanation of the emotional turmoil we are experienc-
ing. Theosophy is not made public as a â€œrevelation,â€ nor is mere
â€œbeliefâ€ in these teachings solicited. It claims consideration on the
ground of inherent reasonableness, and its clear application to the
facts as they may be observed by anyone. If it be taken only as a
â€œworking hypothesis,â€ much can be gained from an impartial study
of Theosophical teaching, and consistent judgment and comparison
of these doctrines with all other views of life is sure to result in a
just appreciation of the great contribution of the Teachers of The-
osophy to the modern world.
Naturally, little more than â€œintimationsâ€ of the scope of the The-
osophical philosophy can be presented in the compass of these few
pages. However, should the suggestions here provided arouse the
inquirer to pursue his studies further, he will ï¬nd in the basic texts
of the philosophy a ï¬eld of research that will challenge his highest
faculties and reward even the most extravagant hopes.
2 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
The great scientiï¬c discoveryof the nineteenth centurywas the
Law of Evolution. It was not a reallyâ€œnewâ€ idea, but one well
known to the Teachers of antiquity, of both India and Greece, and
rather than discovered, was â€œrevivedâ€ in a new form. Few
men of the West are aware that the original of this modern doctrine
maybe found in so ancient a scripture as the Laws of M anu. There
is, however, a vitallyimportant difference between ancient and mod-
ern theories of evolution.
As everyone knows, the Darwinian Theory, which maybe taken
to represent the scientiï¬c view of evolution, was developed to explain
the manychanges in form which various species of plants and ani-
mals have undergone through millions of years in the past. Darwin
studied the changes and evolution in bodies, as though no other kind
of progress were possible, and all the scientists who have since added
facts and theories to our understanding of evolution followed his
example. The result has been that we think of evolution as simply
a physical process, in which the powers developed are physical,
whollya product of the growth and perfection of animal bodies.
But there is another kind of evolution than that common to the
lower kingdoms of natureâ€”an evolution peculiar to man, which is
intellectual and moral. The lines of physical, intellectual and moral
evolution are all three present in human beings, and it is possible to
distinguish between them and to realize how essentiallydiï¬erent
theyare, one from the other. Aman mayhave an excellent body,
yet be intellectuallyweak; and the same man mayhave either a
good or a bad moral nature. Awise man maylive in a puny, dis-
eased body, using his understanding to overcome the limitations of
his physical organism. In the same way, remarkable mental powers
maybe joined to moral goodness, in which case we have a sage; or
intellectual abilitymaybe the servant of calculating selï¬shness in
another man, with quite different results for his fellow human beings.
All in all, taking men as we ï¬nd them in our own experience, it should
be plain that theydiffer one from another far more in these psychic
qualities than in anydistinctions of body, and that the true evolu-
tion of mankind lies in the further development of their mental and
moral powers.
This view of evolution takes our inquiryinto a sphere of experience
and studythat is quite unfamiliar to western thought. The whole
question of â€œthe psychic" and abnormal powers and phenomena has
for several centuries been almost entirelyneglected bythe scholars
and scientists of European andAmerican civilization. Not until the
PSYCHIC EVOLUTION 3
past twentyyears or so has there been anyreal willingness on the
part of the leaders of western thought to admit even the possibility
that soul- or mind-powers mayexist and act independentlyof the
physical bodyand the laws of external nature. And even now, with
the most forceful evidence of powers of a psychic character before
themâ€”telepathy, clairvoyance, and even pre-vision are now gener-
allyaccepted byimpartial investigatorsâ€”our scientists are for the
most part still reluctant to consider that there maybe laws of mind
and soul action which should be studied as principles distinct in them-
selves, not dependent on the laws known to physicists and biologists.
The facts are plain, and are increasing with each year of research.
Ultimately, in the course of this century, theywill be recognized as
realities, and an attempt will have to be made to explain them, even
if this requires complete revision of all our western theories of life
and evolution. It was in anticipation of this general trend in modern
thoughtâ€”indicative of the next great step in human evolutionâ€”that
the Third Object of the Theosophical Societywas stated as:
The investigation of the unexplained laws of nature and the
psychical powers latent in man.
Suggestion has been given of what some of the â€œpsychical powers
latent in manâ€ maybe, but what about â€œunexplainedâ€ laws of nature?
The admirer of modern science asks quite naturally, Are not the laws
of nature themselves the explanations?As a matter of fact, they
are not. Lest there be misunderstanding on this score, a passage on
the law of â€œGravitationâ€ maybe quoted from a recent scientiï¬c Writer:
Just because the effects of gravitation are so familiar and because
Newtonâ€™s law accounts so completelyfor the motions of the heav-
enlybodies, except for a few minute effects which Einstein's theory
represents better than Newtonâ€™s, we are apt to forget how mysterious
gravitation is and how little our so-called explanations penetrate the
mystery. . . . Our so-called physical explanations are almost always
mere descriptions of one sort or another.â€˜
H
Newton himself made no pretense of being able to â€œexplain the
cause of gravitation, and said so quite frankly, and it has remained
a mysteryfrom that dayto this. Thus there was everyreason in
the world for Theosophyto propose another approach to the great
questions of the laws of nature and the powers in man. The method
of physical science had, it is true, given us much practical knowledge
concerning the use of the forces of nature, enabling western nations
â€˜Lambert, Walter D., Scientific Monthly, May, 1925.
4. CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
to raise a great civilization upon this foundation, but the meaning of
life remained a secret that Science could not discover, and it is now
evident to all thoughtful persons that the real meaning and purpose
of existence is byfar the most important thing for human beings to
investigate. The teachings ofTheosophyare in the world to meet
this need.
Man has now reached a point where he is beginning to in-quire
what more there is for him to know. He has ceased to think exclu-
sivelyof the material side of life; he is sensing his own nature, feel-
ing within the slow awakening of powers long hidden and asleep,
and he asks: What am I, whence came I, whither do I go?
There is no possible wayof understanding or explaining the an-
swers to these questions except through Evolution, and for Man
this is evolution of the Soul. Man is a spiritual being, and his evolu-
tion is an unfolding from within outward, the expression of spirit
or consciousness through the intelligence he has acquired byexperi-
ence. dll evolution involves the growth of intelligence through ex-
perience, and the consequent further expression of the powers of
Spirit, but in man is manifested a type of intelligence that is higher
than that seen in the lower kingdoms of nature.
The development of intelligence proceeds veryslowlyin the
mineral and vegetable kingdoms, more rapidlyin the animal kingdom.
Evolution in these three kingdoms is represented bychanges in physi-
cal form, byadaptation to external conditions and the elaboration of
organs for specialized functions. Human evolution is of another
sort. Man is not simplyconcerned with states and conditions of
matter; the evolution of intelligence in him has reached that stage
where the being himself knows that he is, that he is conscious, that
he can understand to some extent his own nature and the natures
of the beings below him, and recognize the interrelation of all.
Two-thirds of a centuryago, H. P. Blavatskywrote on the open-
ing page of Isis Unveiled:
Is it too much to believe that man should be developing new sensi-
bilities and a closer relation with nature? The logic of evolution
must teach as much, if carried to its legitimate conclusions. If,
somewhere, in the line of ascent from vegetable or ascidian to the
noblest man a soul was evolved, gifted with intellectual qualities, it
cannot be unreasonable to infer and believe that a facultyof per-
ception is also growing in man, enabling him to descryfacts and
truths even beyond our ordinaryken. We believe in no Magic
which transcends the scope and capacityof the human mind, nor
PSYCHIC EVOLUTION 5
in â€œmiracle,â€ whether divine or diabolical, if such implya trans-
gression of the laws of nature instituted from all eternity. Never-
theless, we accept the saying of the gifted author of F estus, that the
human heart has not yet fullyuttered itself, and that we have never
attained or even understood the extent of its powers.
The two large volumes of this work are devoted to a demonstra-
tion of the hidden powers in man and to an exposition of the philos-
ophyof evolution which alone can explain their presence. All past
historyis the authorâ€™s witness, brought upon the stand of impartial
inquiryand made to show that there have been literallythousands
of men and women in whom the powers of soul have ï¬‚owered more
fullythan in ordinarypersons, whose lives gave evidence of the
course of evolution of the race as a whole in the future.
It was not Madame Blavatskyâ€™s purpose to arouse a mere curiosity
about the wonderful, to raise up a generation of seekers after powers
bywhich the world might be amazed and even enslaved. On the con-
trary, she desired onlythat men might grow into realization of their
own potentialities as spiritual beings, naturally, with an appreciation
of the enormous responsibilities which the possession of such powers
places upon their user. She knew that in the course of the present
cycle there was destined to be a vast unfoldment of the subtler
faculties of perception in the human race; that powers hitherto the
endowment of onlythe seer and the sensitive would tend to become
more common, until ï¬nally, to be without them would be a mark of
atavism and retrogression.
Clearly, so complete a development of psychic powers among
humanityat large will occupymanyhundreds, or rather, thousands
of years. In the scheme of evolution offered in the Theosophical
philosophy, human and all other progress proceeds in accordance
with great cycles, some of them lasting through almost incalculable
periods of time, during which the hosts of human souls involved
in this great period of manifestation return again and again to
earth, according to the law of Reincarnation. Bythis process the
collective experience in the school of life is carried on, each cycle
of incarnation bringing the soul into contact with new relations of
matter and intelligence, thus awakening to action in the beings the
powers and faculties potential in that cycle. The end of all this
learning is the progressive spiritualization of mankind, through a
growing realization of universal brotherhood, and the achievement
of conscious divinityfor each human soul bythe natural develop-
ment of the powers common to all.
LAWS AND PHENOMENA
note very loosely every kind of mental phenomena, such as
mediumship and the higher sensitiveness, hypnotic receptivity,
inspired prophecy, simple clairvoyance or seeing in the Astral Light,
and truly divine seership; in short, the word conveys every phase
and manifestation of the powers and potencies of the human and the
divine Souls.
I
PSYCHISM is a term used in Theosophical literature to de-
The psychic or soul nature of man has powers of its own, which
may be studied in relation to the physical organism. The coordinated
functioning of psychic and physical powers results in the familiar
processes of waking lifeâ€”perception, feeling, thinking, remembering,
imagining and willing. Modern psychology has studied these pro-
cesses with such devotion, and on the assumption that the soul or ego
has no powers of its own separate from the body, that the edu-
cated person of today knows little or nothing of the higher psychology
of the spiritual man, and is even ignorant of the subtle forces which
have their play in the lower psychic or astral man. Hence the
mysteries with which present study of psychic phenomena is sur-
rounded. It is safe to say that not one of the modern investigators
of the psychic world, scientist or some other, has perfected his con-
trol of the inner faculties and powers with which every man is en-
dowed, so that he may exercise them independently of the body, or,
at least, free of the illusions of sense perception. How, then, can there
be knowledge of these things, without the control which is the pre-
requisite to knowledge in every branch of science?
Mediumship is the abnormal manifestation of psychic powers, and
is generally the result of disease of some sort, or prolonged psycho-
logical malpractice. The few determined individuals who have de-
veloped themselves to the point where these powers are obedient
servants of the human will, have been known through history as
adapts. As Madame Blavatsky has written:
The exercise of magical power is the exercise of powers natural,
but superior to the ordinary functions of Nature. Amiracle is not a
violation of the laws of Nature, except for ignorant people. Magic
is but a science, a profound knowledge of the Occult forces in Nature,
and of the laws governing the visible or the invisible world. Spiritual-
ism in the hands of an Adept becomes Magic, for he is learned in
the art of blending together the laws of the universe, without break-
ing any of them and thereby violating Nature. In the hands of an
LAWS AND PHENOMENA
experienced medium, Spiritualism becomes unconscious sorcery; for,
by allowing himself to become the helpless tool of a variety of
spirits, of whom he knows nothing save what the latter permit him
to know, he opens, unknown to himself, a door of communication
between the two worlds, through which emerge the blind forces of
nature lurking in the astral light, as well as good and bad spirits.
To doubt magic is to reject History itself, as well as the testimony
of ocular witnesses thereof, during a period embracing over 4,000
years, beginning with Homer, Moses, Hermes, Herodotus, Cicero,
Plutarch, Pythagoras, Apollonius of Tyana, Simon the Magician,
Plato, Pausanias, Iamblichus, and following this endless string of great
men-â€”historians and philosophers, who all of them either believed
in Magic or were magicians themselvesâ€”and ending with our modern
authors such as W. Howitt, Ennemoser, G. des Mousseaux, Marquis
de Mirville and the late Eliphas Levi, who was a magician himself.
Madame Blavatsky reveals the ridiculous character of the claims
of spiritualists that such sages and great teachers were â€œmediumsâ€
Fancy Christ, Moses, or an Apollonius of Tyana, controlled
by an Indian guide! Spiritual mediums were better known in those
days to the ancients, than they are now to us. The inspired sibyls,
pythonesses, and other mediums were entirely guided by their high
priest and those who were initiated into the esoteric theurgy and
mysteries of the temples. Theurgy was Magic; as in modern times,
the sibyls and pythonesses were mediums; but their high priests were
magicians. That is the reason why no trash was allowed to be given
by unprogressed spirits iii the days of old. The oracles of the sibyls
and inspired priestesses could never have affirmed Athens to be a town
in India, or jumped Mount Ararat from its native place down to
Egypt.
At the same time, the ancients had their illegal mediumsâ€”those
who belonged to no special templeâ€”and thus the spirits controlling
them, unchecked by the expert hand of the magician, were left to
themselves, and had all the opportunity to perform their capers on
their helpless tools. Such mediums were generally considered ob-
sessed and possessed, which they were in fact. According to Bible
phraseology, these mediums were ordered to be put to death, for the
intolerant Moses, the magician, who was learned in the wisdom of
Egypt, had said, â€œThou shalt not suffer a witch to live.â€ Alone
the Egyptians and the Greeks, even more humane and just than
Moses, took such into their temples, and, when found unï¬t for the
sacred duties of prophecy, cured them in the same Way as Jesus Christ
cured Mary of Magdala and many others.
Thus Magic exists, and has existed, ever since prehistoric ages.
Beginning in history with the Samothracian Mysteries, it followed its
8 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
course uninterruptedly, and ended for a time with the expiring
theurgic rites and ceremonies of Christianized Greece; then reap-
peared for a time again with the Neoplatonic, Alexandrian school,
and, passing by initiation to sundry solitary students and philoso-
phers, safely crossed the medieval ages, and notwithstanding the
furious persecutions of the Church, resumed its fame in the hands
of such Adepts as Paracelsus and several others, and ï¬nally died
out in Europe with the Count St. Germain and Cagliostro, to seek
refuge from frozen-hearted scepticism in its native country of the
East.
While knowledge of the laws governing psychic phenomena was
lost to the western world with the rise of Christianity, the phenomena
themselves did not cease occurring. From biblical days until the pres-
ent, religious history is full of accounts of psychic inspiration. The
crudely emotional â€œspeaking in tonguesâ€ is with us yet, and just as the
ancient Jews were guided by prophecy, so there are today Christian
sects who turn for guidance to the vaticinations of a select few of
the sensitives among their members. The visions and visitations ex-
perienced by so many of the Christian Fathers were especially psych-
ic. The demonology of the Dark Ages, the witch-hunting and heretic-
baiting for hundreds of years by â€œChristianâ€ priests, the periodic out-
breaks of wild enthusiasm for this, that or the other practice or belief
-â€”these are the evidences of psychism through western history. When
the manifestations have been associated with genuine religious devo-
tion, and personal purity, then a kind of spiritual vision, a higher
psychism, reveals itself in the clairvoyant perception and unmistakable
prophetic power which develop in sensitive individuals. But psychism
in company with evil ways and low habits of thought always leads to
unspeakable moral degradation. The fate of mediums who employ
their unnatural gifts for pay is sufficient evidence of this. The barter-
ing of psychic powers for material gain is a kind of prostitution that
Nature ï¬nds intolerable, and the price paid by the medium for his
weakness is often the loss of personal immortality.
The lives of the saints of the Catholic Church are an almost unin-
terrupted history of psychic phenomena. Unquestioning faith in the
reality of the other world, coupled with child-like belief in Christian
dogmas, brought intense psychic experiences to thousands of loyal
Christians. As the historian, Ennemoser, relates:
Visions were most frequent in convents, where solitude, ascetic
practices, fasting, uncared-for diseases, as spasmodic convulsions, the
unoccupied, often dreaming and overflowing imagination, gave
numerous opportunities for the formation of these objective pictures.
The history of the middle ages, even as far as the sixteenth century,
LAWS AND PHENOMENA9
is scarcelymore than a historyof magnetism and a universal system
of so-called witchcraft and magic. Visions were so common that
rules were given to distinguish those of divine origin from false de-
lusions and the temptations of the devil.
Manyof the â€œwitchesâ€ burned at the stake bythe Church were
simple psychics, mediums, who knew onlythat theysuffered inward
experiences that theycould not understand and could not control. In
other cases, these manifestations took the form of what the sensitive
imagined to be divine inspiration, leading to a life of consecration in
the service of this spiritual guidance. ]oan ofArc was such a pure
psychic, suffering the usual fate of the reformer who dares to op-
pose the â€œspiritualâ€ monopolyof established religion. It is charac-
teristic of everypsychic vision that the medium sees the apparition,
or hears voices, which seem to conï¬rm or elaborate upon the beliefs
of the medium himself. Thus even the great Swedenborg, whose
visions startled all Europe, and whose clairvoyant report of the
Stockholm ï¬re convinced even Emmanuel Kant of the existence of
this power, was subject to misconception and error. The invisible
world of psychic perception is as diverse in its aspects as the physical
one, and inï¬nitelymore difficult to understand. Thus Swedenborg,
claiming to have met the inhabitants of Mercuryin the spirit-world,
described them as being dressed in clothes such as were worn in
Europe at that time. No psychic ever sees quite correctly, however
remarkable maybe the approximations of his sight.
II
There are laws of psychic perception taught byTheosophy, some
of which maybe stated as follows:
Thought passes to and fro from man to man. At a higher
level it does the same from higher intelligences to man, and all in a
sphere beyond the material. Men, from different causes, rising to
different levels above their ordinaryouter selves, come into the
psychic plane where all is spread out before them. Theysee and read
onlythat for which theyare ï¬tted, and comprehend onlythat for
which theyare prepared. Through conscious or unconscious exalta-
tion theyrise into or come in contact with some current of thought or
unspoken word which enters their brains bydivers roads. Compre-
hended partly, perhaps, but being entirelyforeign to their normal
personal manner of thinking,â€”knowing theyhave heard a voiceâ€”
it is ascribed to a Spirit, although in fact it maybe the thought of a
living man theyhear, feel, see or are repeating. All men who by
effort or training lift themselves consciously, or are lifted uncon-
10 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
sciously above the material, secure the wisdom, knowledge and in-
spiration of other planes. How much they understand of these
visions will depend upon their knowledge of occult philosophy.
Clairvoyant perception, unless supported by philosophical per-
spective, is absolutely unreliable. Clairvoyants have on innumerable
occasions given correct descriptions of events and persons they could
never have known or seen, but other innumerable times they have
failed. If it were not always a matter of doubt and difficulty, natural
clear-seers would have long ago demonstrated the unerring range
of their vision by discovering uncaught criminals, by pointing out
where stolen property could be recovered, by putting a ï¬nger on a
moral plague-spot which is known to exist but cannot be located.
Yet this they have not done, and theosophists are conï¬rmed in the
old teaching that the ï¬eld of clairvoyance is full of delusions.
The prime cause for delusion is that the thought of anything makes
around the thinker an image of the thing thought about. And all
images in this thought-ï¬eld are alike, since we remember an object by
our thought-image of it, and not by carrying the object around in our
heads. Hence the picture in our aura of what we have seen in the
hands of another is of the same sortâ€”for untrained seersâ€”as our
ideas on the subject of events in which we have not participated.
So a clairvoyant may, and in fact does, mistake these thought-pictures
one for the other, thus reducing the chances of certainty. If an
anxious mother imagines her child in danger and with vivid thought
pictures the details of a railway accident, the picture the seer may
see will be of something that never happened and is only the product
of emotion or imagination.
Mistakes in identity come next. These are more easily made on
the astral plane, which is the means for clairvoyance, than even upon
the visible one, and will arise from numerous causes. So numerous
and complex is this that to fully explain it would not only be hopeless
but tedious. For instance, the person, say at a distance, to whom
the clairvoyant eye is directed may look entirely different from real-
ity, whether as to clothing or physiognomy. He may, in the depths of
winter, appear as clad in spring clothing, and your clairvoyant re-
ports that, adding probably that it symbolizes something next spring.
But, in fact, the spring clothing was due to his thoughts about a
well-worn comfortable suit of this sort, throwing a glamor of the
clothing before the vision of the seer. Cases like this have been
verified. The lover, dwelling on the form and features of his be-
loved, or the criminal upon the one he has wronged, will work a pro-
tean change and destroy identiï¬cation.
LAWS AND PHENOMENAII
Another source of error will be found in the unwitting transfer to
the clairvoyant of your own thoughts, much altered either for better
or for worse. Or even the thoughts of someone else whom you have
just met or just heard from. For if you consult a seer on some line
of thought, having just read the ideas on the same subject of another
who thinks verystronglyand veryclearly, and whose character is
overmastering, the clairvoyant will in all likelihood feel the influence
of the other and give you his ideas.
III
In the light of these principles, it should be plainlyevident that
psychic visions are usuallydressed up bythe imagination of the seer,
and the historyof psychism gives full support to this explanation.
In the Middle Ages, sensitives saw angels and devils. Nuns had
visions of Christ, and suffered from strange delusions of heavenly
marriage, showing the close relation between the sexual instinct and
the psychic or astral plane. The correlation of sex aberrations with
religious mania is well-known to psychiatrists, and the similar con-
nection of the commoner types of obsession has been observed by
physicians who have tried in vain to bring some relief to weak-willed
victims of spiritualistic practices. One has simplyto turn the pages
of mediaeval books on witchcraft, such as Malleus Maleficarum, the
â€œWitch-hammer,â€ published in 1489, to see that the Incubi and
Succubi which so horrified pious Christians of that day, became, in
the nineteenth century, the â€œspiritâ€ brides and grooms of modern
Spiritualism.
The form taken bypsychic manifestation is determined primarily
bythe moral level of those to whom it comes, and in bright relief
to the commoner types of psychic experience are the great healing
powers born to certain philanthropic physicians of the past. Such a
man was Valentine Greatrakes, who lived in Ireland in the seven-
teenth century. In 1662 he discovered that he had mesmeric power,
and was able to cure diseases of all sorts simplybythe laying on of
hands. After healing thousands in his native country, he went to
England, exercising his beneficent power for the relief of many
eminent persons, all of whom testified to the miraculous nature of
his cures. The famous scientist, Robert Boyle, was among those who
acknowledged the healing power possessed byGreatrakes.
The seventeenth centurywas quite literallya continuous drama
of psychic phenomena. The visions of such religious leaders as
George Fox and John Bunyan began at about the middle of the
century. Fox made it clear that he believed himself inspired bythe
I2 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
Deity, and the Quaker doctrine of Inner Light, a pure and en-
nobling form of psychism, has continued to the present day. Bunyan,
more extravagant in his emotionalism, seems to have gone mad under
the influence of â€œthe spirit.â€ Soon after his marriage, in 1649, â€œhe
prayed to trees, to a broomstick, to the parish bull. He tried to
work miracles, ordering the puddles in the road to dry up and stak-
ing his salvation on the result.â€ His later life was more rational,
although GraceAbounding, which Bunyan wrote in 1666, is in these
days said to contain â€œparticulars sufficient to fill up the certificate and
case-book of a mental specialist.â€ One of the founders of the Phila-
delphian Brethren, an English mystical society of the seventeenth
century, was Dr. John Pordage, whose visions were even more dra-
matic than those of the more famous religious leaders of that day.
Pordage relates that he and the members of his society witnessed
daily scenes in heaven and hell. â€œThey beheld the Prince of Dark-
ness, and damned souls in the shape of men, pass by in grand proces-
sion in chariots of clouds, and surrounded by lesser spirits in swarms.â€
The visions, claimed the Philadelphians, continued for months.
George Fox often performed â€œspiritualâ€ cures, and many of the
early Friends manifested clairvoyant and prophetic powers. The
Quakers certainly discovered some minor secrets of occultism, for
Cotton Mather relates that they used in his time to proselyte people
by merely stroking or breathing upon them. Persecuted as they
were, mesmeric powers must have grown among them as one result
of their constant devotion to what they believed to be right.
The rappings, movement of objects and other wonderful occur-
rences that have come to be associated with modern spiritualism,
have been known in every age. In 1716-17, the home of John Wesley,
who was later to found the sect of Methodism, was the theater of
knockings, groans and even apparitions. Full accounts of these hap-
penings have been left by the Wesley family. Later in the eighteenth
century, about a hundred years before the phenomena of 1848, Ger-
many and Switzerland had their spiritualists, developing, or believ-
ing in phenomena identical almost in all particulars with those of
America. Among the various manifestations were so-called â€œspirit
writing,â€ and other forms of intercourse with what many thought
to be the spirit world. In 1756, Emmanuel Swedenborg sat in a
house in Gottenberg and described the great fire that was then rag-
ing in Stockholm, 300 miles away. Two days later a courier from
Stockholm confirmed Swedenborg's account in every detail, from
the time the fire started to when it was put out, even as to the
particular houses that were destroyed.
PSYCHISM AND SPIRITUALISM
I
E: century of western history is marked by waves and out-
bursts of psychic experience and phenomena. The cycle has
its premonitory symptoms during the early decades of the
century, and usually flowers at the midpoint, continuing and spread-
ing its influence for a time, then diminishing gradually until the
beginning of the next cycle. An interesting illustration of this cycle
is provided by the Shakers, an ascetic Christian sect of which scarcely
a dozen members are today alive. The psychological history of the
Shakers really begins with George Fox, founder of the Society of
Friends, who in 1647 became filled with the conviction that he was
a chosen instrument of Providence. He felt that the voice of God
spoke within him. The religious reforms accomplished by the Quak-
ers are well known, and the theosophist has nothing but respect and
admiration for the nobility of purpose which animated George Fox
and so many of his self-sacrificing followers. But we are presently
concerned with the fact that his inspiration, whatever its origin, took
the coloring of the emotional nature of George Foxâ€”was filtered
through his psycheâ€”and the significance of the moving force he felt
in his heart was given an interpretation he thought to be the true one.
George Fox made no impartial comparison of his psychological
experience with the psychological experiences of other men. Instead,
he interpreted what he felt according to the prevailing religious
beliefs of his times. This fact identifies his experience as essentially
psychic in character.
So it was with Ann Lee, the â€œMother Annâ€ of the Shakers. She
was a member of â€œThe United Society of Believers in Christ's Second
Appearing,â€ a small Quaker sect which was led by James and Jane
Wardley in England at the middle of the eighteenth century. This
group of religious enthusiasts had been formed under the inspira-
tion of some Camisards, French Huguenots who, years before, had
fled to England to escape the persecutions which followed the revoca-
tion of the Edict of Nantes. Like so many who suffer for their
beliefs, the Camisards believed they had clairvoyant inspiration.
Mrs. Wardley was subject to seizures of â€œthe spirit,â€ bringing her,
as she thought, special illumination, and she predicted the second
coming of Christ in the form of a woman. Ann Lee, who joined the
Wardleys in 1758, was born of poor Manchester parents and in her
girlhood suffered from hysteria and convulsions. She preached in
the streets of Manchester, accompanying her moving exhortations
14 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
with shouting, the unintelligible â€œspeaking in tongues,â€ and other
physical manifestations. Hence the name, â€œShaking Quakers,â€ which
later became simply â€œShakers.â€ Imprisoned for this behavior, Ann
Lee claimed that Jesus appeared to her in her cell and became one
with her â€œin form and person,â€ which led the Wardleys and their
followers to recognize in her the female Christâ€”-the Bride of the
Lamb. Persecutions only excited her to another revelationâ€”that
America would be the scene of Christâ€™s Kingdom on Earth. Emigrat-
ing to the New World in I774 with a handful of followers, â€œMother
Annâ€ established the ï¬rst Shaker community near Albany. A few
years later they were joined by a number of Baptist converts living
in Lebanon, and from that time the community grew and branched
out in Massachusetts and Connecticut.
The Shakers were perfectionists, believing that they had estab-
lished a veritable heaven on earth, and if their conduct is any cri-
terion, this conviction was well founded. Some writers have likened
them to the ancient Essenes. Their personal lives were models for
a successful communistic enterprise. It is curious that as a sect, Shak-
erism survived and ï¬‚ourished for more than I00 yearsâ€”longer than
any other attempt at a communistic societyâ€”despite the rule of
complete chastity established byAnn Lee. They lived on a simple
fare, few of them eating meat, and were almost never ill. Celibates
all, their numbers were augmented only by conversion, and by I860
some 6,000 Shakers were in America, living in communities in New
York and New England. Of peculiar interest is the Shaker com-
munity dance, which was a sort of shuffling march to one of their
hymns, varied by occasional â€œwhirlingâ€ for a considerable time.
Although the Shakers always professed to have intimate inter-
course with the â€œspirit world,â€ special intimations of the psychologi-
cal upheaval which was to occur in America came to the Shakers in
I837. There were at that time sixty Shaker communities. The chil-
dren of the Lebanon settlement were the ï¬rst to experience the de-
velopment of clairvoyant powers, and were seized with trances. It
was not long before nearly all the members of the various Shaker
settlements found themselves in communication with â€œspirits.â€ Much
of their music they professed to have learned from â€œspirits.â€ Rea-
lizing, however, that these manifestations would have marked them
as insane in the eyes of a sceptical world, they maintained complete
secrecy about their intercourse with â€œspiritsâ€â€”most of whom were
Indiansâ€”until after 1848. After the remarkable phenomena of the
Fox sisters and other mediums had attracted widespread interest, an
elder of the community, Frederick B. Evans, related the visitations
PSYCHISMAND SPIRITUALISM 15
experienced bythe Shakers, which had begun eleven years earlier.
He said that the spirits had told the Shakers that the phenomena
were destined to spread throughout America and Europe. Nearly
everyShaker was a medium, according to their own word, and for
seven years after the ï¬rst â€œinvasionâ€ of the spirits whole houses of
Shakers were periodicallyobsessed byIndian â€œspirits.â€
The experiences of the Shakers were more or less unique in their
collective anticipation of the psychic phenomena which ï¬‚ooded over
America, marking the mid-centurycycle of psychism. There were,
however, several individuals to whom religious revelations of a spir-
itualistic character came during this earlier period. In I830 Joseph
Smith and six of his followers organized the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-daySaints to spread the teachings which had been revealed
to him in a series of visions. He was, he claimed, personallyvisited
bytwo persons of the HolyTrinity, the Father and Son. Later it
was made known to him that he had been selected to preach a new
gospel, and an angel who appeared to him directed the discoveryof
the gold plates on which the Book of Mormon was engraved in an
unknown language. Enabled to translate the scripture bymeans of
glasses provided bythe Lord, Joseph Smith became the prophet
whose new revelation was regarded as of equal authoritywith the
Jewish and Christian scriptures. In thirtyyears the Mormons were
well established in Utah and elsewhere, their number totalling some
200,000. Todaythere are 750,000 Mormons, serious men and
women who are universallyrespected for their honesty, industryand
sobriety. The head of the Mormon Church is believed bythe Mor-
mons to receive revelations direct from God, obtained through
dreams or waking visions, â€œbyvoices without visional appearance, or
byactual manifestation of the HolyPresence before the eye.â€
Joseph Smithâ€™s ï¬rst vision followed his attendance at a religious
revival held in Wayne County, NewYork. These outbursts of re-
ligious psychism resulted in several such â€œinspirations.â€ The ï¬erce
revival of I831 began the moodymeditations of John Humphrey
Noyes, who was to found the communityof â€œBible Communistsâ€ at
Oneida Creek. He abandoned law and took up the studyof theology.
Finding no light in his course in divinityat Andover, he went toYale,
and there he learned through dreams that God had a divine plan
which he, Noyes, was to realize in its perfection on earth. There fol-
lowed a re-interpretation of the Gospel of Paul, which led to the
formation of the Perfectionists according to the program revealed
to this prophet of Christian communism. Like the Mormons, the
16 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
Noyes communitysuffered manyvicissitudes, but due to the inde-
fatigable labors so frequentlyexhibited bythose who think them-
selves divinelyinspired, it achieved a success in economic and social
organization that is todaywell known. The Oneida Communityis
famous for the silverware produced in its factories. Both com-
munities have held unconventional ideas on the subject of marriage-
the Mormons as part of their religious doctrines, the Oneida com-
munists as practical eugenists attempting to improve the race physi-
callyas well as â€œspiritually.â€
Another forerunner of the spiritualistic cycle of the nineteenth
centurywas the famous seer of Poughkeepsie, Andrew Jackson
Davis. Born in 1826, as a boyhe heard voices which gave him
advice and comfort. He developed clairvoyant powers and it was
discovered that he could diagnose disease. His powers were studied
and fostered bya travelling mesmerist, William Levingston, and in
I844. Davis began to report long ï¬‚ights of soul experience while in
trance. He claimed to have two venerable instructors whom he later
identiï¬ed as Galen and Swedenborg. In his nineteenth year he began
writing about his psychic experiences, the Rev. William Fishbough
acting as his amanuensis, who took down the revelations declared
bythe young man after he had been placed in a trance condition.
During the course of his life Davis wrote twentybooks, including a
remarkable autobiographygiving account of his clairvoyance and his
psychic adventures, and his visions of the meaning of death and the
states after death. His Harmonial Philosophycomprised a series
of volumes and became virtuallythe bible of the spiritualists, passing
through fortyeditions. This work contains a remarkablycoherent
theoryof cosmogonysimilar to that of Swedenborg, and a detailed
description of the â€œspiritual world.â€ It also expounds a theoryof
evolution. Davis predicted the coming cycle of spiritualism, writing
in I847 that â€œthe world will hail with delight the ushering-in of that
era when the interiors of men will be opened, and the spiritual com-
munion will be established. . . .â€ He should, however, be regarded
as a seer rather than an ordinarymedium, for he speciï¬callyre-
nounced the idea of â€œcontrolâ€ byspirits, although admitting their aid.
II
It should be realized that the abnormal states of consciousness
which had grown familiar to the people of Europe through the work
of Mesmer and his disciples were not unknown inAmerica. The doc-
trine of animal magnetism and its curative power ï¬rst taught bythe
Viennese genius had various embodiments inAmerica under other
PSYCHISMAND SPIRITUALISM 17
names. As earlyas 1830 John Bovee Dods lectured in New Eng-
land on â€œElectrical Psychology,â€ proclaiming electricityto be the
connecting link between mind and matter. AFrenchman, Charles
Poyen, began giving public demonstrations of Mesmerism inAmer-
ica in 1836. Wandering through New England in 1838, Poyen met
Phineas Quimby, at Belfast, Maine. Quimby, who was then thirty-
six, soon discovered that he, too, had unusual mesmeric power. Ob-
taining a sensitive, Quimbybegan to diagnose the ills of the people
of the village, using the clairvoyant perception of his subject. He
found byexperiment that it made little difference what medicine he
advised, becoming convinced that his cures were effected bymental
influence. On the basis of such experience Quimbyevolved the theory
that all disease is a mental delusion which can be eradicated by
thought. After years of successful practice at Portland, Maine, he
received in 1861 a letter from a Dr. Patterson, asking that Quimby
exercise his â€œwonderful powerâ€ to free Mrs. Patterson (later Mrs.
MaryBaker Eddy) of her invalidism. The essential ideas of Dr.
Quimby's therapy, which he began to record in 1859 in the now
famous â€œQuimbyManuscripts,â€ are best known to the world as
Christian Science.
New Thought, too, derives principallyfrom the doctrines of
Phineas Quimby. In 1869 a Swedenborgian minister of New Hamp-
shire, Warren Felt Evans, pupil and patient of Quimby, began the
flow of New Thought literature with publication ofThe Mental
Cure, which, it appears from comparison, was little more than a re-
ligious version of Quimby's understanding of what he had learned
from his own practice of Mesmerism. Thus, what had originally
been the scientific revelation of the eighteenth century, Mesmer's
rediscoveryof the nervous fluid of the human psyche, and its extra-
ordinarycurative power through the will of the adept-physician,
slowlybecame, byfiltering through the untutored and materialistic
minds of the age, spread bywandering quacks, and interpreted by
ignorant though honest enthusiasts, the source of a hundred and one
psychic cults and sects, each cherishing a fragment of the truth, but
more often misusing it than not.
Much of modern psychoanalysis, too, traces indirectlyto Mesmer.
Janet and Charcot, who both exercised great influence over Sigmund
Freud, developed their doctrines in the atmosphere of the decadent
mesmerism practiced bythe French schools of psychologists. There
is little, of course, in modern psychoanalysis that Mesmer would
recognize, but the basic principle of all psychoanalytical therapy, the
1 8 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
inï¬‚uence wielded byanalyst over the patient, remains as the shadow
of Mesmerâ€™s great contribution. Modern hypnotism, too, is a limited
adaptation of Mesmerâ€™s technique, shorn of its moral and meta-
physical signiï¬cance.
III
We turn, now, to the origins of modern spiritualism in the nine-
teenth century.
In December, 1847, John D. Fox and his familymoved into a
small house in the little village of Hydesville, in Wayne County,
NewYork. Almost at once â€œknocksâ€ or rappings began to occur
during the night. The sounds could not be explained as the result of
anynatural cause and seemed to proceed from a bedroom or the
cellar beneath. The three girls, the youngest of whom was twelve-
year-old Kate, complained of being touched bycold hands. On the
night of March 31, 1848, the familyretired early, being exhausted
from these increasing disturbances which interfered with their rest.
The rappings, however, came louder than ever. Kate Fox, sitting
up in bed, was amused bythe sounds, and snapping her ï¬ngers
cried out:
â€œHere, Mr. Splitfoot, do as I dolâ€
This led to the startling discoverythat the invisible agencywhich
caused the rappings would respond to intelligent direction. Raps ac-
companied her movements. â€œOnlylook,â€ cried Kate; â€œlook, it can
see as well as hearlâ€ The sounds corresponded to her noiseless
motions. It was soon discovered that it was possible to communicate
with this agency, -questions being answered byraps which numbered
the letters of the alphabet. Neighbors were called and excitement
swept the communityof Hydesville. Messages purporting to come
from the â€œspiritâ€ of a murdered pedler were obtained in this way.
From information thus received investigators discovered the remains
of a man who had been buried in the cellar. Bythis strange event,
and bythe correct guessing of the ages of persons, a measure of
veracitywas established for the â€œspirits.â€ Interest in the phenomena
spread and soon the Fox children were made the subject of an unend-
ing series of experiments and public exhibitions, for it had been
observed that the manifestations seemed to require their presence.
It became evident that the communications were not limited to those
from the deceased pedler, but included messages from a host of
â€œspirits,â€ one of them claiming to be Benjamin Franklin. In order
to escape the throng of curious wonder-seekers who gave the family
no peace, and to avoid the persecutions of the sceptical and unbeliev-
PSYCHISM AND SPIRITUALISM 19
ing, the Fox family moved to Rochester. Mrs. Fox, a sincere Meth-
odist, was much disturbed by the abnormal manifestations which
everywhere followed Kate and her older sister, Margaretta. The
distracted mother prayed continually that the torment might cease,
and during the early days of the â€œrappingsâ€ her hair turned white
in a single week. Both she and the children strove in vain against
the â€œspirits,â€ which kept demanding public exhibitions. The oldest
of the girls, Leah, who was then a music teacher living in Rochester,
wrote many years later:
The general feeling of our family . . . was strongly adverse to all
this. . . . We regarded it as a great misfortune which had fallen upon
us; how, whence or Why we knew not. We resisted it, struggled
against it, and constantly and earnestly prayed for deliverance from
it. . . . If our will, earnest desires and prayers could have prevailed
or availed, the whole thing would have ended then and there, and
the world outside of our little neighborhood would never have heard
more of the Rochester Rappings, or of the unfortunate Fox family.â€˜
Nevertheless, the return of the rappings after a cessation of two
weeks is said to have been greeted with joy by the family. Re-
luctantly, they undertook to follow the demands of the â€œspiritsâ€ and
become public mediums. To this occupation they devoted the rest
of their lives.
Meanwhile, following the publicity given to the Fox children, it
became known that similar manifestations were taking place else-
where. In the words of Alfred Russel Wallace, â€œ. . . at the same
time other mediums were discovered in different parts of the country,
as if a special development of this abnormal power were then occur-
ing.â€' This seemed, in effect, a conï¬rmation of the assurance given
by the â€œspiritsâ€ to the Fox sisters that the manifestations were not
to be conï¬ned to them, but would go â€œall over the world.â€ Rappings
occurred as far west as St. Louis and Cincinnati, and in Maine,
Massachusetts and New York. By I 8 50 sÃ©ances arranged according
to the direction of the â€œspiritsâ€ were being held in California, Ore-
gon, Texas, and in several southern states. Religious-minded men
and women formed Spiritualist sects, claiming messages from the
apostles and the Hebrew prophets of old. Thomas Lake Harris,
writer and preacher, joined with Spiritualists to found the â€œApostolic
Brotherhood,â€ which culminated in a spiritualist community known
as the Mountain Cove Movement. Many clergymen developed
psychic capacities and became leaders of small bands of spiritualists.

20 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
Despite vicious attacks on the new â€œrevelationâ€ by sceptics and
orthodox Christians, interest in Spiritualism spread rapidly. Here
and there men of cultivation and learning were attracted to sÃ©ances.
A few Well-known scientists began to investigate the alleged phe-
nomena. Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune, sat with
the Fox sisters in New York, saying in a sympathetic article,
Whatever may be the origin or cause of the â€œrappings,â€ the ladies
in whose presence they occur do not make them. We tested this
thoroughly, and to our entire satisfaction. Their conduct and bearing
is as unlike that of deceivers as possible; and we think no one ac-
quainted with them could believe them at all capable of engaging in
so daring, impious, and shameful a juggle as this would be if they
caused the sounds. And it is not possible that such a juggle should
have been so long perpetrated in public.â€™
Among the eminent men who became convinced of the reality of
spiritualistic phenomena was Judge W. Edmonds, a justice of the
Supreme Court of New York, known for his honesty and fearless-
ness. He publicly defended the mediums in letters to the press. N.
P. Tallmadge, a former governor of Wisconsin, was another who
supported the claims of the mediums after attending a sÃ©ance given
in Washington by the Fox sisters. In the years I851 and I852 sev-
eral spiritualistic journals were established, in which all manner of
supernatural communications were recorded. While the original
phenomena of Kate and Margaretta Fox had been limited to â€œrap-
pings,â€ other phases of the phenomena developed with the multipli-
cation of mediums. Automatic writing became common; messages
alleged to be from the illustrious dead were given by entranced
sensitives, and â€œspirit lightsâ€ and the movement of heavy bodies
were repeatedly reported.
From these beginnings modern Spiritualism spread all over the
world. Few scientists were willing to jeopardize their reputations
by deigning to recognize even the possibility that the phenomena
were not fraudulent. Notable exceptions, however, included the
celebrated Dr. Robert Hare, professor of chemistry in the University
of Pennsylvania, who in I854 published Spiritualism Scientiï¬cally
Demonstrated, an account of the elaborate experiments which con-
vinced him that the manifestations were genuine. He had originally
undertaken the task of investigation in order to destroy scientiï¬cally
â€œthe gross delusion called Spiritualism,â€ but was soon overwhelmed
by evidences of the supernormal. However, even so eminent a man
â€™ Quoted by Emma Hardinge (later Mrs. Britten) in Modern American Spiritual-
ism, New York, 1872.
PSYCHISMAND SPIRITUALISM 21
as he was unable to persuade the American Association for the Pro-
motion of Science to consider the subject of psychic phenomena.
That body at one of its annual conventions turned down all the pro-
posals for investigation which he presented. No more successful in
gaining a hearing from the scientiï¬c world was Prof. James Mapes, president of the Mechanics Institute, a distinguished chem-
ist who had been honored by numerous scientific bodies here and
abroad. Beginning his study of spiritualistic phenomena in order to
redeem respected friends who, he declared, were â€œfast running to
mental seed and imbecility,â€ he ended as an advocate of spiritualism.
IV
It must not be supposed that because Theosophy admits the reality
of these phenomena, it also approves the theories of the Spiritualists.
Nothing could be further from the truth. Afull explanation of the
identity of the seance â€œspiritsâ€ and of spiritualistic phenomena gen-
erally is provided in the pamphlet, Where Are the Dead? (pub-
lished by Theosophy Company). This pamphlet, which is made
up of statements taken from the basic teachings of Theosophy,
should be studied carefully in connection with the whole problem
of Spiritualism. Theosophy does not deny the existence of disem-
bodied spiritual intelligences, but it shows that such beings cannot
be reached by the methods of the Spiritualists. As Madame Bla-
vatsky explains in The Secret Doctrine, it is only â€œby paralyzing
his lower personality, and arriving thereby at the full knowledge of
the non-separateness of his higher Self from the One absolute
SELF,â€ that man can, during his terrestrial life, arrive at that state
of consciousness in which such soul-communion with high spiritual
beings is possible.
Theosophy teaches also that the spirits of the dead cannot return
to earthâ€”save in rare and exceptional cases (see Where dre the
Dead?), nor do they communicate with men except by entirely sub-
jective means. That which does communicate, through the medium,
or appear objectively as a â€œmaterialization,â€ is nothing more than
the phantom of the ex-physical man, his more or less coherent psychic
remains. The spiritual individuality of the disembodied cannot ma-
terialize, nor can it return from its own exalted mental sphere to the
plane of terrestrial objectivity. The idea alone that the intellectual
conscious souls of oneâ€™s father, mother, daughter or brother find
their bliss in a â€œSummer Landâ€ is enough to make one lose respect
for oneâ€™s departed ones. To believe that a pure spirit can feel happy
22 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
while doomed to witness the sins, mistakes, treachery, and, above
all, the sufferings of those from whom it is severed bydeath and
whom it loves best, without being able to help them, would be a
maddening thought.
Everything depends on the view taken of Spirit and Soul, or
Individualityand Personality. Spiritualists confuse the two into
one; Theosophyseparates them, and says that no Spirit will revisit
the earth, though its former â€œanimal soulâ€ may. The â€œspookâ€ that
visits the seances, mistakenlycalled a â€œspiritâ€ bythe Spiritualists,
is onlythe lower animal intelligence of the man that has died. The
gross physical memories of this entity, which is the psychic corpse
of the deceased, maybe drawn to a seance and acquire artiï¬cial life
from the vital psychic atmosphere surrounding the medium. In the
mediumâ€™s aura it lives a kind of vicarious life and reasons and
speaks through the mediumâ€™s brain, deceiving the sitters with frag-
mentaryrecollections of the past. But such communications are no
more â€œspiritualâ€ than the playing of a cracked phonograph record.
Other manifestations, such as â€œrappings,â€ slate-writing, and the
so-called â€œmaterializations,â€ are produced bythe mediumâ€™s astral
body. (See section on Hypnotism.) The laws governing such phe-
nomena are given in greater detail in the portions of the Theosophi-
cal literature devoted to this subject. What is important to be
noted here is the grave danger to both medium and sitters in ex-
posing themselves to the degrading inï¬‚uences of contact with these
â€œshellsâ€ or psychic remains, which have been separated from the
higher part of the soul and remain in the earthâ€™s atmosphere, slowly
disintegrating, and spreading psychic infection and moral disease
among those who become passivelyopen to their inï¬‚uence.
Mediumship and dabbling in Spiritualism, on the supposition that
such practices are â€œspiritual,â€ can bring onlysuffering, and even
mental and physical break-down, in the end, to the psychicallyin-
clined. Theosophy, from the earliest days of the Movement, has
always warned against experimentation and curiosity-hunting in the
ï¬eld of psychic phenomena, as an ignorant playing with sinister
forces that act invisiblyand destructivelyon the victims of spiritual-
istic delusions.
While interest in Spiritualism graduallydied out during the clos-
ing years of the nineteenth century, and was seldom heard from in
the ï¬rst decade of the twentieth century, the loss of loved ones
occasioned byWorld War I brought a sudden revival of the doc-
trines of the Summer Land of spirits. The spiritualistic writings of
PSYCHISM AND SPIRITUALISM 23
the eminent physicist, Sir Oliver Lodge, came into prominence, and
the pitiful account of his â€œcommunicationsâ€ with his son Raymond,
killed in the war, won the sympathy of the few and the curiosity of
the many. A study printed by the Journal of 14 bnormal and Social
Psychology (July, 1942) reports that the number ofAmerican
magazines devoted to Spiritualism grew from ï¬fty-two in 1915 to
a peak of 136 in 1920, then falling off to ï¬fty-eight in 1930. English
publications dealing with the same object increased from seven to
seventy during the same period and fell off to fourteen in 192 5.
Similar increases occurred for journals in the more digniï¬ed ï¬eld
of â€œpsychic research.â€ One of the effects of this revival of interest
was the Scientiï¬cAmerican investigation of â€œMargery,â€ famous
Boston medium, which, while probably increasing the circulation of
that worthy magazine for a short period, accomplished little for the
science of psychic research. The committee of scientists, headed by
Dr. Harlow Shapley of the Harvard Observatory, who sat with the
medium, officially reported nothing of importance, although the em-
inent psychologist, Dr. William McDougall, who served on the com-
mittee, a few years later was instrumental in establishing the pro-
gram of study of telepathy (now called Extra Sensory Perception)
at Duke University. Dr. McDougallâ€™s motives in undertaking
psychic research were almost unique among scientiï¬c men in that they
approximated the reason that H. P. Blavatsky gave for the intelligent
investigation of supernormal phenomena. He said in 1923:
Unless Psychical Research can discover facts incompatible with
materialism, materialism will continue to spread. No other power
can stop it; revealed religion and metaphysical philosophy are equally
helpless before the advancing tide. And if that tide continues to rise
and advance as it is doing now, all signs point to the view that it will
be a destroying tide, that it will sweep away all the hard-won gains
of humanity, all the moral traditions built up by the efforts of count-
less generations for the increase of truth, justice and charity.
In 1937, just one year before his death, Dr. McDougall repeated
his appeal for the rejection of materialism with some leading ques-
tions in the ï¬rst issue of a journal devoted to the investigation of the
supernormal powers in man. â€œWhat,â€ he asked, â€œare the relations
of mind and matter?â€
Are mental processes always and everywhere intimately and utterly
dependent upon material or physical organizations? Do the volitions,
the strivings, the desires, the joys and sorrows, the judgments and
beliefs of men make any difference to the historical course of the
events of our world, as the mass of men at all times have believed?
24 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
Or does the truth lie with those few philosophers and scientists who,
with or without some more or less plausible theory in support of their
view, conï¬dently reject well-nigh universal beliefs, telling us that
the physical is coextensive with the mental and that the powers and
potentialities of mind may be deï¬ned by the laws of the physical
sciences?
The philosophic interest in psychic research harbored by Dr. Mc-
Dougall has been all too rare. Even the somewhat trivial methods
introduced in the Duke program of investigationâ€”the â€œguessingâ€
of cards stamped with symbolsâ€”have been imitated in forms of
parlor entertainment, and too often the telepathic powers discovered
by individuals in themselves have stimulated a course of mediumistic
â€œdevelopment.â€ It is a pity that Dr. McDougall did not realize the
importance of â€œmetaphysical philosophyâ€ as the all-important guide
to investigation of psychic phenomena. Nothing short of philosophy
has the power to prevent the blind rushing of multitudes after the
will-â€™o-the-wisps of â€œspirits,â€ and to sharpen the discrimination of
those who ï¬nd hidden capacities blossoming within themselves. The
increasing instances of psychism in the late thirties and early forties
of the present century are but preludes to a mighty storm of phenom-
enalism and wonder-seeking, destined, according to the law of cycles
taught byTheosophy, to become a psychological hurricane during
the period that is now almost upon us.
While the nineteenth century cycle of psychism did not show its
real strength until 184.8, there was at that time no planetary war
to hasten the longing for communication with those unnaturally cut
off from life in the full bloom of youth. Then, as now, premonitory
symptoms occurred, as among the Shakers, and there were the ex-
periences of theAmerican seer, Andrew Jackson Davis, and of
Daniel Dunglas Home, the English medium, but no foundation for
extensive acceptance of the phenomena existed before 184.8. Only
the heterodox followers ofAnton Mesmer had any intimation of the
psychological laws which might have helped to explain the medium-
istic â€œmiracles,â€ and these few outcasts soon joined the Spiritualistic
movement, of which they became some of the leaders and inter-
preters. It remained for Madame Blavatsky, in 1875, to give voice
to the essential warnings which spiritualists so sorely needed.
There is a law of occult development that works its inexorable
way with all such children of their age who dare to raise the veil
of Isis:
It is impossible to employ spiritual forces if there is the slightest
tinge of selï¬shness remaining in the operator. For, unless the inten-
PSYCHISM AND SPIRITUALISM 25
tion is entirely unalloyed, the spiritual will transfonn itself into the
psychic, act on the Astral plane, and dire results may be produced
by it.
It was not for nothing that Jesus urged his disciples, â€œCome ye out
and be ye separate.â€ Unless the heart be purged of all impurity, all
compromises with human weakness and desire set aside, no door will
be found to the sacred temple of truth, and the terrible occult reality
will inevitably destroy all those who rashly approach without learn-
ing ï¬rst the rule of obedience to time-honored laws.
V
The â€œscientiï¬câ€ investigation of psychic phenomena, as distin-
guished from the religious sects of Spiritualism, has been going on
for many years, adding little knowledge of the laws of the phe-
nomena, but at least convincing all those who have honestly looked
into the ï¬eld that supernormal events are a reality, whatever may
be their meaning. While psychic research is still a somewhat sec-
tarian cultus on the fringe of orthodox and accepted science, it can-
not be denied that these conductors of psychic autopsies have slowly
been gaining recognition. The ï¬rst study of spiritualistic phenomena
by a respected man of science was Prof. Wm. Crookesâ€™ Researches in
the Phenomena of Spiritualism, published in the 1870's. Since his
day other leaders have lent their names to psychic research, the most
outstanding in America being William James, the eminent psychol-
ogist. Charles Richet, the French biologist, admitted to a belief in
the fact of psychic phenomena, candidly confessing his inability to
explain them. In 1920 Baron von Schrenck Notzingâ€™s Phenomena
of Materialization appeared, a weighty volume which left little doubt
that materializations of subtle psychic forms do occur under pro-
pitious conditions. Another highlight in this progressive â€œnaturaliza-
tionâ€ of psychic science was the award in 1937 by Duke University
of a doctoral degree in Philosophy to John F. Thomas, whose con-
tribution to â€œknowledgeâ€ was a 320-page record of spiritualistic
communications from his deceased wife!
The work of investigators like W. Dunne, whose Experiment
With Time (1927) brought the scientiï¬c world convincing testi-
mony of the fact of prophetic dreams; of Dr. Charles Jung, who
made the startling discovery that dream symbols often have the
same pattern as alchemical ï¬gures of the Middle Ages; of Prof.
Bart J. Bok, eminent astronomer of Harvard, who now admits that
there is some truth in astrology, and of many other workers in re-

search, has been undermining the scepticism of scientists for a decade
or more. Dr. Einsteinâ€™s qualiï¬ed approval of Dr. Gustav Strom-
bergâ€™s attempt to (provide a scientiï¬c basis for immortalityin The
Soul of the Universe must also have had its effect.
Meanwhile, literaryï¬gures, all the wayfrom minor luminaries
like Nina Wilcox Putnam and Stewart Edward White to writers
in True Story, have been purveying their psychic revelations to a
growing crowd of enthusiasts and believers. The noted author of
Credo, years later, in The Unobstructed Universe, revealed a life-
long interest in Spiritualism, and set forth claims to receiving from
the spirit of the late Mrs. White, herself a sensitive, a new psychic
cosmologyand philosophyof life.
The Spiritualist cults are gaining a new lease on life bythe recent
appearance of several child mediums, innocent victims of psychic
curiosity, whose achievements have been thoroughlyexploited bythe
sensation-seeking press. Picture magazines, avid for circulation-get-
ting material of this quality, have reproduced the more extraordinary
of â€œspiritâ€ photographs, drawn from private collections. Lilydale,
NewYork, the Spiritualist Mecca, has more than once received
dramatic presentation; notably, in Life for Aug. 2, 1937, when
the whole mythologyof nineteenth centuryspiritualism was revived
and illustrated, with appropriate description in the quip-like style of
the Life editors. -
Teachers of hypnotism abound, and despite warnings byphysi-
cians high in their profession, the fascination of this conjurorâ€™s art
is interesting otherwise sober medical men in techniques that are
broadlyadvertised bythese modern Charcots. Especiallypernicious
attempts are being made in scientiï¬callyauthoritative quarters to
dispel the popular idea that hypnotism is â€œBlack Magic,â€ while the
cures it has supposedlybrought about are recounted in glowing terms.
Volumes could be devoted to description of these symptoms of
renascent psychism, of the unbelievable naivetÃ© of modern cultists,
and of the tragic ignorance of the occult laws that men who imagine
themselves scientists are on the verge of violating in extreme degree.
Suffice it that the evidence is ample to show that the world of psychic
interests and undertakings is a veritable jungle of confusion, full of
fascinating sights and sounds, and rich in the attractions of escap-
ism so longinglysought bya world strained almost to the breaking
point bythe ï¬erce selï¬shness and competitive struggle for existence
which dominate modern â€œcivilization,â€ and bythe unrelieved ten-
sions of periodic wars.
HYPNOTISMAND â€œYOGAâ€
HE real character of hypnotismand hypnotic phenomena is
I difficult for the average man to recognize, not only because of
the admitted ignorance of scientiï¬c investigators in this ï¬eld,
but also, because of the unknown areas of human nature which are
involved. All present practice of hypnotismtraces directly or indi-
rectly toAnton Mesmer, the great healer and occultist of the eigh-
teenth century. Unfortunately for modern medicine, however, Mes-
merâ€™s doctrines were not accepted in professional circles, and the
development of hypnotismfell into the charge of men who were
either ignorant of occult law, or irresponsible in the use of the mes-
meric force. Today the medical historians of hypnotismrejoice that
hypnotismhas been divorced fromMesmerâ€™s theories, as though the
separation were a great step of progress, little realizing that Mesmer
had knowledge of the psychological constitution of man that enabled
himto use his power in a way not open to ordinary men.
Recent years have witnessed a rapid increase in the practice of
hypnotism. In the name of â€œscience,â€ students in scores of colleges
anhd uniyersities are being used as subjects in hypnotic elalcperirpents,
w ile p ysicians are more and more turning to this met od o con-
trolling the minds of their patients. Amateurs, often lacking the
skill of more experienced practitioners, are introducing hypnotism
as parlor entertainment. Meanwhile, â€œexpertsâ€ are claiming that
hypnotismis â€œharmlessâ€ for normal persons. One such writer, Dr.
Paul Campbell Young, had the temerity to maintain, in the Psycho-
logical Bulletin for September, 1926, that â€œbooks that point out the
dangers of hypnotismare far more dangerous than hypnotismitself.â€
Echoing such allegedly â€œscientiï¬câ€ pronouncements, popular writers
for the mass magazines are carrying to the uninformed and defence-
less public the news that hypnotismis capable of miraculous â€œcuresâ€
in many cases of mental and physical ills. In the Reader's Digest
for October, 1943, an article named â€œHypnotismComes of Ageâ€
makes the unqualiï¬ed statement: â€œYou will suï¬‚er no harmful mental
or physical after-eï¬‚ects. Itâ€™s quite possible that hypnosis will fail to
produce the desired results in your case, but youâ€™ll be no worse off
for the trial.â€ The pernicious falsity of this statement would be diffi-
cult to equal. It suppresses facts that are well known and is merely
propaganda for hypnotism.
28 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
The dangers of hypnotism were better understood ï¬fty years ago
than they are today. Jean Marie Charcot, the famous French in-
vestigator of hypnotic states, wrote in the Forum for April, 1890:
For several years the principal towns of Europe have been over-
run by persons . . . bearing high-sounding titles, who invite the
people to hypnotizing performances given in the local theatres. . . .
We can track a showman magnetizer of this sort by his victims
everywhere. When he has gone, it is noticed that subjects . . . with
whom he succeeded best become nervous and irritable. Some of them
fall of their own accord into a deep sleep, out of which it is not
easy to awaken them; thereafter they are unï¬tted for the per-
formance of the duties of every-day life. Others, and they the
majority, are seized with convulsions resembling the crises of con-
ï¬rmed hysteria.
Charcot maintained that the practice of hypnotism should be
limited to trained physicians. William Q. Judge, co-founder, with
Madame Blavatsky, of the Theosophical Movement, in commenting
on Charcotâ€™s view, added his own opinion that hypnotism should be
prohibited by law. â€œNo one,â€ he urged, â€œbut some few high-minded
and learned physicians should be allowed to practice it. I would as
quickly prohibit the general mass of physicians from using it as the
general mass of the public, for I regard it as a dangerous and
injurious power. In the present age I would vote for its total seclu-
sion from use for the present.â€
The following analysis of hypnotism, taken from Mr. Judge's
writings, gives the Theosophical reasons for condemning the practice.
ll 1! Ill
One theory for use in explaining and prosecuting hypnotic research
is about as follows. Man is a soul who lives on thoughts and per-
ceives only thoughts. Every object or subject comes to him as a
thought, no matter what the channel or instrument, whether organ
of sense or mental center, by which it comes before him. These
thoughts may be words, ideas, or pictures. The soul-man has to have
an intermediary or connecting link with Nature through and by
which he may cognize and experience. This link is an ethereal double
or counterpart of his physical body, dwelling in the latter; and the
physical body is Nature so far as the soul-man is concerned. In this
ethereal double (called astral body) are the sense-organs and cen-
ters of perception, the physical outer organs being only the external
channels or means for concentrating the physical vibrations so as to
HYPNOTISMAND â€œYOGAâ€ 29
transmit them to the astral organs and centers where the soul per-
ceives them as ideas or thoughts. This inner ethereal man is made
of the ether which science is now admitting as a necessarypart of
Nature, but while it is etheric it is none the less substantial.
Speaking physically, all outer stimulus from nature is sent from
without to within. But in the same waystimuli maybe sent from
the within to the without, and in the latter mode is it that our
thoughts and desires propel us to act. Stimuli are sent from the astral
man within to the periphery, the physical body, and maydominate
the bodyso as to alter it or bring on a lesion partial or total. Cases
of the hair turning greyin a night are thus possible. And in this way
a suggestion of a blister maymake a physical swelling, secretion,
inï¬‚ammation, and sore on a subject who has submitted himself to
the inï¬‚uence of the hypnotizer. The picture or idea of a blister is
impressed on the astral body, and that controls all the physical
nerves, sensations, currents, and secretions. It is done through the
sympathetic nervous plexus and ganglia. It was thus that ecstatic
fanatical women and men bybrooding on the pictured idea of the
wounds of Jesus produced on their own bodies, byinternal impres-
sion and stimulus projected to the surface, all of the marks of crown
of thorns and wounded side. It was self-hypnotization, possible only
in fanatical hysterical ecstacy. The constant brooding imprinted the
picture deeplyon the astral body; then the physical molecules, ever
changing, became impressed from within and the stigmata were the
result. In hypnotizing done byanother the onlydifference is one
of time, as in the latter instances the operator has simplyto make
the image and impress it on the subject after the hypnotic process has
been submitted to, whereas in self-hypnotization a long-continued
ecstasyis necessaryto make the impression complete.
When the hypnotic processâ€”or subjugation, as I call itâ€”is sub-
mitted to, a disjunction is made between the soul-man and the astral
body, which then is for the time deprived of will, and is the sport of
anysuggestion coming in unopposed, and those mayand do some-
times arise outside of the mind and intention of the operator. From
this arises the sensitiveness to suggestion. The idea, or thought, or
picture of an act is impressed bysuggesting it on the astral body,
and then the patient is waked. At the appointed time given bythe
suggestor a secondarysleep or hypnotic state arises automatically,
and then, the disjunction between soul and astral bodycoming about
of itself, the suggested act is performed unlessâ€”as happens rarely
-â€”the soul-man resists sufficientlyto prevent it. Hence we point to
3O CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
an element of danger in the fact that at the suggested moment the
hypnotic state comes on secondarilybyassociation. I do not know
that hypnotizers have perceived this. It indicates that although the
subject be dehypnotized, the influence of the operator, once thrown
on the subject, will remain until the dayof the operator's death.
But how is it that the subject can see on a blank card the pic-
ture of a object which you have merelywilled to be on it? This
is because everythought of anyone makes a picture; and a thought
of a definite image makes a definite form in the astral light in which
the astral bodyexists and functions, interpenetrating also everypart
of the physical body. Having thus imaged the picture on the card,
it remains in the astral light or sphere surrounding the card, and is
there objective to the astral sense of the hypnotized subject.
The great question mooted is whether there is or is not anyactual
fluid thrown off bythe mesmerizer. Manydenyit, and nearlyall
hypnotizers refuse to admit it. H. P. Blavatskydeclares there is
such a fluid, and those who can see into the plane to which it belongs
assert its existence as a subtle form of matter. This is not at all in-
consistent with the experiments in hypnotism, for the fluid can have
its own existence at the same time that people maybe self-hypnotized
bymerelyinverting their eyes while looking at some bright object.
This fluid is composed in part of the astral substance around every-
one, and in part of the physical atoms in a finelydivided state. By
some, this astral substance is called the aura. But that word is in-
definite, as there are manysorts of aura and manydegrees of its
expression. These will not be known, even to Theosophists of the
most willing mind, until the race as a whole has developed up to that
point. So the word will remain in use for the present.
This aura, then, is thrown off bythe mesmerizer upon his subject,
and is received bythe latter in a department of his inner constitu-
tion, never described byanyWestern experimenters, because they
know nothing of it. It wakes up certain inner and non-physical
divisions of the person operated on, causing a change of relation
between the various and numerous sheaths surrounding the inner
man, and making possible different degrees of intelligence and of
clairvoyance and the like. It has no influence whatsoever on the
Higher Self, which it is impossible to reach bysuch means. Many
persons are deluded into supposing that the Higher Self is the re-
sponder, or that some spirit or what not is present, but it is onlyone
of the manyinner persons, so to say, who is talking or rather causing
the organs of speech to do their office. And it is just here that the
HYPNOTISMAND â€œYOGAâ€ 3:
Theosophist and the non-Theosophist are at fault, since the words
spoken are sometimes far above the ordinaryintelligence or power
of the subject in waking state. I therefore propose to give in the
rough the theoryof what actuallydoes take place, as has been known
for ages to those who see with the inner eye, and as will one day
be discovered and admitted byscience.
When the hypnotic or mesmerized state is complete--and often
when it is partialâ€”there is an immediate paralyzing of the power
of the bodyto throw its impressions, and thus modifythe concep-
tions of the inner being. In ordinarywaking life everyone, without
being able to disentangle himself, is subject to the impressions from
the whole organism; that is to say, everycell in the body, to the
most minute, has its own series of impressions and recollections, all
of which continue to impinge on the great register, the brain, until
the impression remaining in the cell is fullyexhausted. And that
exhaustion takes a long time. Further, as we are adding continually
to them, the period of disappearance of impression is indeï¬nitely
postponed. Thus the inner person is not able to make itself felt.
But, in the right subject, those bodilyimpressions are bymesmerism
neutralized for the time, and at once another effect follows, which
is equivalent to cutting the general off from his armyand com-
pelling him to seek other means of expression.
The brainâ€”in cases where the subject talksâ€”-is left free suf-
ï¬cientlyto permit it to obeythe commands of the mesmerizer and
compel the organs of speech to respond. So much in general.
We have now come to another part of the nature of man which
is a land unknown to the Western world and its scientists. Bymes-
merism other organs are set to work disconnected from the body,
but which in normal state function with and through the latter.
These are not admitted bythe world, but theyexist, and are as
real as the bodyisâ€”in fact some who know saytheyare more real
and less subject to decay, for theyremain almost unchanged from
birth to death. These organs have their own currents, circulation
if you will, and methods of receiving and storing impressions. They
not onlykeep them but veryoften give them out, and when the
person is mesmerized their exit is untrammelled bythe body.
Theyare divided into manyclasses and grades, and each one of
them has a whole series of ideas and facts peculiar to itself, as well
as centres in the ethereal bodyto which theyrelate. Instead now of
the brainâ€™s dealing with the sensations of the body, it deals with
something quite different, and reports what these inner organs see
32 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
in any part of space to which they are directed. And in place of your
having waked up the Higher Self, you have merely uncovered one
of the many sets of impressions and experiences of which the inner
man is composed, and who is himself a long distance from the Higher
Self. These varied pictures, thus seized from every quarter, are
normally overborne by the great roar of the physical life, which-is
the sum total of possible expression of a normal being on the physical
plane whereon we move. They show themselves usually only by
glimpses when we have sudden ideas or recollections, or in dreams
when our sleeping may be crowded with fancies for which we cannot
ï¬nd a basis in daily life. Yet the basis exists, and is always some
one or other of the million small impressions of the day, passed un-
noticed by the physical brain, but caught unerringly by means of
other sensoriums belonging to our astral double. For this astral
body, or double, permeates the physical one as colour does the bowl
of water. And although to the materialistic conceptions of the pres-
ent day such a misty shadow is not admitted to have parts, powers,
and organs, it nevertheless has all of these with surprising power
and grasp. Although perhaps a mist, it can exert under proper
conditions a force equal to the viewless wind when it levels to earth
the proud constructions of puny man.
In the astral body, then, is the place to look for the explanation
of mesmerism and hypnotism. The Higher Self will explain the
ï¬‚ights we seldom make into the realm of spirit, and is the God-â€”
the Fatherâ€”within who guides His children up the long steep road
to perfection. Let not the idea of it be degraded by chaining it to
the low ï¬‚oor of mesmeric phenomena, which any healthy man or
woman can bring about if they will only try. The grosser the oper-
ator the better, for thus there is more of the mesmeric force, and if
it be the Higher Self that is affected, then the meaning of it would
be that gross matter can with ease affect and deï¬‚ect the high spiritâ€”
and this is against the testimony of the ages.
The mesmeric ï¬‚uid brings the paralysis about by ï¬‚owing from the
operator and creeping steadily over the whole body of the subject,
changing the polarity of the cells in every part and thus disconnect-
ing the outer from the inner man. As the whole system of physical
nerves is sympathetic in all its ramiï¬cations, when major sets of
nerves are affected others by sympathy follow into the same condi-
tion. So it often happens with mesmerized subjects that the arms or
legs are suddenly paralyzed without being directly operated on, or,
as frequently, the sensation due to the ï¬‚uid is felt ï¬rst in the fore-
arm, although the head was the only place touched.
HYPNOTISMAND â€œYOGAâ€ 33
There are manysecrets about this part of the process, but they
will not be given out, as it is easyenough for all proper purposes
to mesmerize a subject byfollowing what is alreadypubliclyknown.
Bymeans of certain nerve points located near the skin the whole
system of nerves maybe altered in an instant, even bya slight breath
from the mouth at a distance of eight feet from the subject. But
modern books do not point this out.
When the paralyzing and change of polarityof the cells are
complete the astral man is almost disconnected from the body. Has
he anystructure? What mesmerizer knows? How manyprobably
will denythat he has anystructure at all? Is he onlya mist, an idea?
And yet, again, how manysubjects are trained so as to be able to
analyze their own astral anatomy?
Disjoin this being from the outer bodywith which he is linked,
and the divorce deprives him of freedom temporarily, making him
the slave of the operator. But mesmerizers know verywell that the
subject can and does often escape from control, puzzling them
often, and often giving them fright. This is testiï¬ed to byall the
best writers in the Western schools.
Now the inner man is not byanymeans omniscient. He has an
understanding that is limited byhis own experience, as said before.
Therefore, error creeps in if we relyon what he says in the mesmeric
trance as to anything that requires philosophical knowledge, except
with rare cases that are so infrequent as not to need consideration
now. For neither the limit of the subjectâ€™s power to know, nor the
effect of the operator on the inner sensoriums described above, is
known to operators in general, and especiallynot bythose who do
not accept the ancient division of the inner nature of man. The
effect of the operator is almost always to colour the reports made
bythe subject.
Body, soul, and astral man properlyin relation give us a sane
man; hypnotized, the relation is broken and we have a person who
is not for the time whollysane. Acute maniacs are those in whom
the disjunction between astral man and soul is complete. VVhere the
hypnotized one remains for months in that state, the astral man has
become the slave of the bodyand its recollections, but as the soul
is not concerned no real memoryis present and no recollection of
the period is retained.
The varied personalities assumed bysome subjects brings up the
doctrine of a former life on earth for all men. The division between
soul and astral man releases the latter from some of the limitations
34 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
of brain memory so that the inner memory may act, and we then
have a case of a person reÃ©nacting some part of his former life or
lives. But a second possibility also exists,â€”that by this process
another and different entity may enter the body and brain and mas-
querade as the real person. Such entities do exist and are the astral
shells of men and women out of the body. If they enter, the person
becomes insane; and many a maniac is simply a body inhabited by
an entity that does not belong to it.
The process of hypnotizing is as yet unknown in respect to what
does happen to the molecules. We claim that those molecules are
pressed from periphery to center instead of being expanded from
the inside to the surface. This contraction is one of the symptoms
of death, and therefore hypnotizing is a long step toward physical
and moral death. The view expressed by Dr. Charcot that a subject
is liable to fall under the inï¬‚uence at the hands of anyone should be
admitted, as also that in the wake of the hypnotizer will be found a
host of hysteriacs, and that it all should be regulated by law is un-
questionable. I go still further and say that many persons are already
in a half-hypnotized state, easily inï¬‚uenced by the unprincipled or
the immoral; that the power to hypnotize and to be sensitive to it
are both progressive states of our racial evolution; that it can and
will be used for selï¬sh, wicked, and degrading purposes unless the
race, and especially the occidental portion of it, understands and
practises true ethics based on the brotherhood of man. Ethics of the
purest are found in the words of Jesus, but are universally negatived
by Church, State, and individual. The Theosophical doctrines of
man and nature give a true and necessary basis and enforcement to
ethics, devoid of favoritism or illogical schemes of eternal damna-
tion. And only through those doctrines can the dangers of hyp-
notism be averted, since legislation, while affixing penalties, will not
alter or curtail private acts of selï¬shness and greed.

There is no question but that hypnotism brings â€œresultsâ€ of a sort,
but so will partial knowledge of any of the laws of nature. Asavage
may be taught to set off a charge of explosive that is miles away.
He will hear the report and conclude by highly scientiï¬c reasoning
from cause to effect that he knows what happens when he presses
the plunger. But not until he is led to the place of the explosion
does he discover that the charge has torn away the side of a hill,
or reduced a human habitation to ruins. Modern scientiï¬c ignorance
HYPNOTISM AND â€œYOGAâ€ 35
of the psychological constitution of man completes the analogy, for
the effect of hypnotism may be just as catastrophic as the more vio-
lent eï¬‚ect of an explosion. One is external and physical, the other in-
ternal and psychic, attacking the inner organism of man with a subtle
disintegration that remains unperceived until its ravages are far ad-
vanced. It is not contended that hypnotism invariably produces this
result, but that, in view of the nature of the process, such is the com-
mon effect. Many factors, among them the motives of both prac-
titioner and subject, enter in. The real causes of disaster are the
non-moral approach to manâ€™s subtle psychological nature, and the
blinding ignorance of the semi-occult character of the forces that are
invoked. '
Dangers similar to those involved in hypnotism confront those
who indulge in the Eastern psychological practices that have re-
cently become popular in the West. Many people begin â€œbreathing
exercisesâ€ and postural disciplines under the delusion that they are
â€œspiritual.â€ Suffice it to point out that the Oriental teachers dispose
of this idea by calling all such practices Hatha Yoga, which means,
simply, physical discipline. There is nothing spiritual about it.
The hazards of Hatha Yoga are undreamed of by the average
westerner. Afew years ago, an English writer, Gerald Heard, spoke
of breathing exercises as â€œthe most instant and powerful of all the
physical methods of affecting, altering and enlarging consciousness.â€
While tempering this judgment with some warnings against the
consequences of this physical kind of â€œyoga,â€ he adds that â€œit is a
risk we have no choice except to take.â€
For those who are attracted to taking this â€œrisk,â€ the following
experiment, conducted byWm. Q. Judge, is described. Mr. Judge
wrote:
The persons present were myself, a well-known physician whose
name I can give, and the practitioner. The physician ï¬rst took the
personâ€™s pulse for three minutes and found it to be running at ninety-
six beats per minute; and then the experiment began with the prac-
tice with the following result:
First minute. Pulse fell to 91 beats.
Second minute. Pulse fell to 81 beats.
Third minute. Pulse remained at 81 beats.
Adelay of ï¬ve minutes then occurred, when the practice was begun
again for six minutes, with the following result:
First minute. Pulse running at 91 beats a minute.
36 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
Second minute. Pulse fell to 86 beats.
Third minute. Pulse remained at 86.
Fourth minute. Pulse fell to 76.
Fifth minute. Remained at 76.
Sixth minute. Remained at 76.
This shows a reduction in the pulse action of twenty beats in
fourteen minutes. It also shows that after the ï¬rst three minutes
the intermission of ï¬ve minutes was not enough to enable the pulse
to go back to ninety-six beats, at which it started. The ï¬rst three
minutes showed a fall of ï¬ve beats in the ï¬rst minute and ten in
the next minute, making ï¬fteen beats reduction for the three minutes.
It therefore appears that one of the accompaniments of this prac-
tice is a distinct effect upon the action of the heart, and as all the
Hindu books invariably state that great caution should be used and
that there are dangers, we can see here a very great danger found in
an effect upon the heartâ€™s action, resulting in a reduction of pulse
beats of twenty beats in fourteen minutes. The Hindu books to
which I have referred, and which are the only works through which
inquirers have heard about these practices, also say that a guide who
is fully acquainted with the subject is necessary for each student, and
that every one of these practices requires an antidote for its effects
through other regulations tending to neutralize the bad physical
effects. Students have been too anxious to try these experiments
without paying any attention to the cautions given out, and I know
of some cases in which, while well remembering that the cautions
had been uttered, persons have pursued these practices by themselves
without assistance.
* * * * *
Discussing so-called â€œpractical yogaâ€ in another place, Mr. Judge
called attention to the fact that the directions found in the
Upanishads, with regard to breathing and postural exercises, should
never be practiced except under the following conditions: (a) a
complete knowledge of all the consequences, with a knowledge of
correctives to be applied when changes take place; and (b) the pos-
session of a thoroughly competent guide to point out errors, to
restrain endeavour and to indicate danger, as well as to cure troubles
that ensue.
Yet in the face of all this, and of re-peated warnings, there are
those who will foolhardily begin the practices in complete ignorance.
HYPNOTISMAND â€œYOGAâ€ - 37
They do not even pursue the ethical regulations that accompany all
the others, such as the doing away with all vices, bad habits, unchar-
itable thoughts and so on; but go in for the practices, merely in the
hope of procuring psychic powers. It is time it were stopped, and
time that those who give out this literature looked into what they
give out to a grasping and stiff-necked generation. That damage
has been wrought cannot be contested, in face of actual experience.
It is well known that these postures, even when ignorantly used,
bring on physiological changes in the body, with great nervous de-
rangements.
The need of the West is not for Hatha Yoga, but of that other
and higher discipline, known in the Orient as Raja Yoga. Hatha
Yoga is a practical mortiï¬cation of the body, by means of which
certain powers are developed. Raja Yoga, on the other hand, dis-
cards those physical motions, postures and recipes relating solely to
the present personality, and directs the student to virtue and altru-
ism as the bases from which to start. Besides the higher objective
presented by Raja Yoga, there is the enormous danger which the
western student exposes himself to by attempting Hatha yogic
development. Even though he may follow rules given by a teacher
more or less informed, he will inevitably arouse about him inï¬‚uences
that do him harm, and he also carries his natural functions to cer-
tain states now and then when he ought to stop for a while, but,
having no knowledge of the matter, may go on beyond and produce
injurious effects. The greatest objection to it, however, is that it
pertains to the material and semi-material man,â€”roughly, to the
body, and what is gained through it is lost at death.
PSYCHOLOGY OF THE ANCIENTS
HILE the phenomena and beliefs known today under
the general name of â€œSpiritualismâ€ are often thought
to be of recent origin, dating back less than one hundred
years, a study of history will show that these abnormal manifesta-
tions have been present among all peoples and in all times. Actually,
it would be diï¬‚icult to ï¬nd an epoch in which psychic phenomena
were not better understood than they are today. Our ignorance of
these matters is due to the materialism of both science and religion,
the one denying the phenomena altogether, the other ignoring them,
or, in the case of the Catholics, making the devil and his ï¬ends the
scapegoats for all unnatural events, excepting, of course, the â€œmira-
clesâ€ performed by loyal Christians, which are explained by divine
intervention l
The ancients, however, thought otherwise. Belief in spirits and
invisible worlds, and in the possibility of intercommunication between
men and intelligences existing on other planes was, until quite re-
cently in our history, common to all mankind. The religions and
philosophies of the ancients are ï¬lled with allusions to â€œgodsâ€ and
â€œspiritsâ€ of various kinds. The symbolic and legendary accounts of
creation found in the Puranas of India describe an almost inï¬nite
diversity of such beings known by the generic name â€œDevas.â€ Their
total number, according to the Hindus, is 330,000,000. H. P.
Blavatsky described them as â€œthe embodied powers of states of
matter, more reï¬ned than those with which we are familiar.â€ While
the term Devas may be rendered â€œGodsâ€ in English, it must not be
supposed that they are all degrees of being far above man. They
represent the various powers and forces in nature, each class pos-
sessing a degree of intelligence, but the kind of intelligence we see
manifested in the various kingdoms.
Personiï¬cation has always been the method of teachers who have
had to deal with the mind of the masses, and hence we ï¬nd tales
of the â€œGodsâ€ in every land, of beings who have been anthro-
pomorphized by the popular imagination, and then worshipped.
The secret teachings of the great religions of the world explain the
inner meaning of these allegories, of which we have a familiar ex-
ample in the Mysteries of Greece. St. Paul, in the ï¬rst epistle to the
Corinthians, says, â€œKnow ye not that we shall judge angels,â€ making
clear that he had been initiated by the Pagan philosophers of his
time. For the angels of Christianity are but the devas of India, the

daimons of Greece, borrowed from the past by the Christian Fathers
and Catholic theologians. Jehovah himself, the personal God of
the Old Testament, was but one of the subordinate powers of Nature,
the tutelary spirit of that great prophet-medium, Moses, whose per-
sonal ambition led him to pass off his â€œfamiliarâ€ as the very Spirit
of God!
Belief in â€œspiritsâ€â€”legitimate because resting on the authority of
experiment and observationâ€”vindicates at the same time another
belief, also regarded as a superstition, namely polytheism. The lat-
ter is based on a fact in nature; spirits mistaken for Gods have been
seen in every age by men: hence belief in many and various Gods.
Monotheism, on the other hand, rests upon a pure abstraction. Who
ever saw God?â€”that God, we mean, the Infinite and the Omni-
potent, the one about whom the monotheists talk so much? Poly-
theismâ€”when once man claims the right of divine interference on
his behalfâ€”is logical and consistent with the philosophies of the
East, all of whichâ€”whether pantheistic or deisticâ€”proclaim the
One to be an infinite abstraction, an absolute Something, which
utterly transcends the conception of the finite. Surely such a creed is
more philosophical than the religion whose theology, proclaiming
God in one place as a mysterious and an incomprehensible Being,
shows him at the same time so human and so petty a God as to con-
cern himself with the breeches of his chosen people while neglect-
ing to say anything definite about the immortality of their souls or
their survival after death!
The mere presence, however, of doctrines relating to the existence
of invisible beings, or â€œspirits,â€ of itself offers little in rational ex-
planation of spiritualistic phenomena. Otherwise the blanket charge
of diabolism made by the Roman Catholics such as de Mirville and
des Moisseaux, and more lately by Montague Summers, would
suffice. Actually, there is plenty of evidence to show that the an-
cients had knowledge of those many classes of beings which the Spirit-
ualists so loosely denominate â€œspirits of the dead,â€ that they were in
many cases masters, instead of merely the passive mediums, of the
occult powers. They knew from a profound metaphysical philosophy
and discipline that there are many classes of spirits, some good,
some bad. Of the latter all too many mediums have learned to their

even unto the thighs they shall reach.â€ (Exodus xxviii, 42.) God a linen-draper and

sorrow . . . and too late. Jakob G0rres, a German author of the
last century, conversing with some Hindus of the Malabar Coast,
asked if there were ghosts among them. They replied that there
were, but recognized them as â€œbad bhuts,â€ principally the remains
of suicides and murderers, or of those who died violent deaths. These
spirits ï¬‚utter about and appear as phantoms. Night-time is favor-
able to them, they seduce the feeble-minded and tempt others in a
thousand different ways. (Mystique, iii, 63.)
When Madame Blavatsky told her Hindu friends of the efforts
of European and American Spiritualists to communicate with the
dead they exclaimed in undisguised horror: â€œCommunion with
bhutsâ€”communion with souls that have become wicked demons, to
whom we are ready to offer sacriï¬ces in food and drink to pacify
them and make them leave us quiet, but who never come but to dis-
turb the peace of families; whose presence is a pollution!What
pleasure or comfort can the Bellate (white foreigners) ï¬nd in com-
municating with them ?â€
This does not mean that the sages of antiquity disbelieved in
beneï¬cent spiritual inï¬‚uences, but only that they distinguished
clearly between the material and earthly shades known in the East
as Bhuts or devils, and the purely subjective spiritual intelligences
that work for the elevation and inspiration of mankind. The East-
ern teaching, however, is that such communion is possible only after
a long period of extreme discipline, through which the disciple at-
tains by successive stages the powers of inner perception which belong
to the adept or initiate. First of all, in this training, the slightest
tendency to passivity must be destroyed. Unless this is done the
aspirant may become the victim of malicious entities which inhabit
the lower psychic atmosphere of the earth. Passivity, note well, is
the sine qua non of successful mediumship, which in the ancient view
exposes the sensitive to the baleful emanations of the lowest of the
invisible spheres.
The Gods or Devas of the Orient were known to the Greeks as
Daimons. Their view of the invisible world and its various inhab-
itants was essentially the same as that of the Hindus. In Platonic
philosophy the souls of exalted men were literally â€œgods,â€ in that
they participated in the One. In many places Plato shows his famil-
iarity with the ancient Aryan philosophy. In the Phaedrus he de-
scribes the highest initiation of the Mysteries, whereby one became
the spectator of â€œentire, simple, immovable, and blessed visions,
resident in a pure light.â€ The Timaeus gives account of the
â€œDaimons who inhabit the air, are always near to us, . . . inter-
PSYCHOLOGY OF THE ANCIENTS 4.1
mediate between gods and men.â€ The Bhuts of the Hindus are
identiï¬ed in the Phaedo as â€œghostly apparitions of souls which have
not departed pure.â€ Xenocrates, a Platonist who expounded many
of the unwritten theories and teachings of his master, taught that
the Daimons are intermediate beings between the divine perfection
and human sinfulness, and he divides them into classes, each sub-
divided into many others. But he states expressly that the individual
or personal Soul is the leading guardian Daimon of every man, and
that no Daimon has more power over us than our own. Thus the
Daimon of Socrates is the God or Divine Entity which inspired him
all his life. It depends on man either to open or close his percep-
tions to the Divine voice.
Heracleides, who adopted fully the Pythagorean and Platonic
views of the human Soul, its nature and faculties, speaking of
Spirits, calls them â€œDaimons with airy and vaporous bodies,â€ and
affirms that Souls inhabit the MilkyWay before descending â€œinto
generationâ€ or sublunary existence.
The fact is that the word Daimon was applied by the ancients, and
especially by the Philosophers of the Alexandrian school, to all
kinds of spirits, whether good or bad, human or otherwise, but the
appellation was often synonymous with that of Gods or angels.
Under the general designation of fairies, and fays, the spirits of
the elements appear in the myths, fables, traditions, or poetry of
all nations, ancient and modern. Their names are legionâ€”peris,
devs, djins, sylvans, satyrs, fauns, elves, dwarfs, trolls, norns, nisses,
kobolds, brownies, necks, stromkarls, undines, nixies, goblins, ponkes,
banshees, kelpies, pixies, moss people, good people, good neighbors,
wild women, men of peace, white ladiesâ€”â€”and many more. They
have been seen, feared, blessed, banned, and invoked in every quarter
of the globe and in every age.
These nature-spirits, or elementals, as they have been called, must
not be confused with human ghosts or the psychic remains of those
who have died. Proclus has written explicitly of the â€œsecond death,â€
by which these remains of the psychic man are left behind:
After death, the soul continueth to linger in the aerial body, till
it is entirely puriï¬ed from all angry and voluptuous passions . . . then
doth it put off by a second dying the aerial body as it did the earthly
one. Whereupon, the ancients say that there is a celestial body
always joined with the soul, which is immortal, luminous, and star-
like. . . .
42 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
This is obviously the â€œspiritual bodyâ€ spoken of by St. Paul,
whose triune division of manâ€”body, soul, and spiritâ€”was in per-
fect accord with the Greek conception. The aerial body mentioned
by Proclus is, like the physical, mortal; it is the psyche, â€œfrom ele-
ments it was formedâ€”to elements it must return.â€ The nous, or
understanding, according to the Greeks, is the eternal spirit in man.
Plutarch wrote of the fate of the psyche, or lower human soul:
And of these souls the moon is the element, because souls resolve
into her as the bodies of the deceased do into earth. Those, indeed,
who have been virtuous and honest, living a quiet and philosophical
life, without embroiling themselves in troublesome affairs, are quickly
resolved; being left by the nous and no longer using the corporeal
passions, they incontinently vanish away.
The more coherent of these psychic â€œcorpses,â€ made so by an
intensity of the passions during life, are the Elementaries of the
Kabalists, the Incubi and Succubi of the MiddleAges. Especially
to be feared were the victims of suicide and sudden death, for whom
the natural terminus of life had not come. Of these the N eoplatonist,
Porphyry, wrote:
The soul, having even after death a certain affection for its body,
an affinity proportioned to the violence with which their union was
broken, we see many spirits hovering in despair about their earthly
remains; We even see them eagerly seeking the putrid remains of
other bodies, but above all freshly-spilled blood, which seems to
impart to them for the moment some of the faculties of life.
These entities were known to the Romans as â€œlarvae,â€ or ma-
lignant spirits of the dead. Good human spirits became â€œgods.â€
The Roman celebration of Lemuria included rites which were sup-
posed to rid the home of lingering shades or shells.
The Magi and theurgic philosophers objected most severely to
necromancy, or the â€œevocation of souls.â€ â€œBring her [the soul]
not forth, lest in departing she retain something,â€ says Psellus, a
Neoplatonist of the Byzantine Renaissance. â€œIt becomes you not
to behold them before your body is initiated, since, by always allur-
ing, they seduce the souls of the uninitiatedâ€â€”says the same philos-
opher in another passage.
The ancients objected to necromancy for several good reasons.
â€œIt is extremely difficult to distinguish a good Daimon from a bad
one,â€ says Iamblichus. If the spell of a good man succeeds in pene-
trating the density of the earthâ€™s atmosphereâ€”always oppressive to
it, often hatefulâ€”still there is a danger that it cannot avoid; the
soul is unable to come into proximity with the material world with-
PSYCHOLOGY OF THE ANCIENTS 43
out that on â€œdeparting, she retains something,â€ that is to say, she
contaminates her purity, for which she has to suffer more or less
after her departure. The evil terrestrial â€œDaimonsâ€ seek to intro-
duce themselves into the bodies of the simple-minded and idiots,
and remain there until dislodged therefrom by a powerful and pure
will. Jesus, Apollonius, and some of the apostles, had the power
(( Y)
to cast out devils, by purifying the atmosphere within and with-
out the patient, so as to force the unwelcome tenant to ï¬‚ight.
Although Aristotle himself, anticipating the modern physiologists
and behaviorists, regarded the human mind as a material substance,
he fully believed in the existence of a â€œdoubleâ€ soul, or spirit and
soul. He laughed at Strabo for believing that any particles of matter,
per se, could have life and intellect in themselves sufficient to fashion
by degrees such a multiform world as ours.
Of the gross terrestrial. shells, Porphyry remarked:
These invisible beings have been receiving from man honours as
gods; . . . a universal belief makes them capable of becoming very
malevolent; it proves that their wrath is kindled against those who
neglect to offer them a legitimate worship.
He said further,
Daimons are invisible; but they know how to clothe themselves
with forms and conï¬gurations subjected to numerous variations,
which can be explained by their nature having much of the corporeal
in itself. Their abode is in the neighborhood of the earth . . . and
when they escape the vigilance of the good Daimons, there is no
mischief they will not dare commit. One day they will employ brute
force; another, cunning. . . .
It is a child's play for them to arouse in us vile passions, to impart
to societies and nations turbulent doctrines, provoking wars, sedi-
tions, and other public calamities, and then tell you â€œthat all of these
are the work of the gods.â€ . . . These spirits pass their time in
cheating and deceiving mortals, creating around them illusions and
prodigies; their greatest ambition is to pass as gods and souls.
Iamblichus, the great theurgist of the Neoplatonic school, and
instructor of Porphyry in sacred magic, wrote in The Mysteries of
the Egyptians that the bad Daimons â€œmanifest themselves but under
the shadowy forms of phantoms.â€ They â€œrequire darkness. . . .
The sensations they excite in us make us believe in the presence and
reality of things they show, though these things be absent.â€
A careful reading of Isis Unveiled, supplemented by independent
research into the psychological teachings of the ancient Hindus and
Greeks, cannot fail to show, ï¬rst, the basic uniformities in the de-
44 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
~-
scriptions of various sorts of psychic phenomena, and, second, the
essential identity of the explanations offered. If the investigator
will make the entirely justiï¬able assumption that the ancients may
have had psychological knowledge, based upon personal experience,
which far transcends our own, such research will undoubtedly lead
him to discoveries that conï¬rm in principle and in many details the
Theosophical teachings regarding these phenomena. It should be
recognized and admitted that while western civilization may have
reached new heights in the ï¬eld of technology and mechanical inven-
tion, it is childish and even arrogantly provincial to assume that'a
knowledge of the psychic, intellectual and moral constitution of man,
superior to our own limited understanding in these departments,
could not have existed in the past.
Unless some such recognition is made, and a respectful hearing
accorded to the representations made for the great psychologists
of antiquity, it may well happen that the ï¬‚ood of psychic irregular-
ities resulting from the emotional cataclysm of war, and the natural
turning of public interest to things psychic, will deliver millions of
gullible victims into the hands of charlatans and exploiters of the
â€œpsychic.â€ There is a science of these things, there are principles to
be known, laws to be grasped, and warnings to be issued and ob-
served. But that science will never grow from the materialism of
modern psychology, nor from dilettante undertakings in spiritual-
ism and â€œmagicâ€ by sophisticated curiosity hunters.
The moral science of psychology has its foundations in a spiritual
conception of man, developed in terms of strict metaphysical prin-
ciples, with clear doctrines of the migrations and changes of the
soul in relation to embodied existence. The proofs and tests of that
science are not available to those who refuse to conform to the
ethical precepts on which it is founded, or who will not look in the
direction from which the evidence of its verity is forthcoming. Little
can be done for such as these, nor has the theosophical student any
particular obligation to them. The teachings of Theosophy, whether
as anciently expressed, or in their modern exegesis, are for those who
want them; who, genuinely bewildered by the claims and counter-
claims of mediums, pseudo-occultists, and â€œyogisâ€ from the East,
puzzled by the agnosticism of science, and the apathy of religion,
are determined to find out if there are such things as psychic phe-
nomena, and hidden or occult powers in man, and what, if any, may
be the meaning of them all. Theosophy is primarily a philosophy of
life, but it is also practical psychology which comprehends in its pur-
view all the strange and inexplicable experiences that come to men.
PSYCHISM TODAY
magazines of the day, and who notes the character of books
being published for popular circulation, that there is a growing
interest in so-called â€œpsychicâ€ subjects. The rigidly materialistic
outlook of yesterdayâ€™s science, once regarded by most people as the
ï¬nal authority in all important questions, no longer prevailsâ€”a
change in attitude which is as much due to the philosophical, even
mystical, tendencies among leading scientists themselves as to any-
thing else. The vast unexplored area of supernormal psychological
powers resident in man is receiving the attention of orthodox scien-
tiï¬c investigators, and these workers, while not without their oppon-
ents, are slowly gaining the approbation of thoughtful men and
women. Concurrently with these developments in the scientiï¬c and
academic world has come a renascence of popular interest in the
â€œoccult,â€ the mysterious and the supernatural. Although lacking the
scholarly sanction of modern university authorities, this widespread
attraction to psychic wonders, spiritualistic phenomena and the like
is far more signiï¬cant of the trend of human thought and activity
than the erudite and guarded speculations of a few scientists. Some
broad tendency of human nature is gradually emerging, ï¬nding ex-
pression through various channels and at diï¬erent levels of intel-
ligence. So numerous are the indications of this change in attitude,
and so far-reaching its eï¬ects on modern life, that one is justiï¬ed
in proposing the question: Is it mere coincidence that men and
women in all walks of life are turning to the psychic and occult,
whether it be for purposes of religious satisfaction, scientiï¬c inquiry,
or even amusement, or can there be discerned some unifying prin-
ciple, some broad psychological conception which will account for
this almost universal trend?
I
IT is quite evident to everyone who reads the newspapers and
Perhaps the most telling indication of the supremacy of psychism
lies in its negative aspectâ€”the breakdown of the rational method of
dealing with human problems. This we ï¬nd to a startling degree in
recent political events in Europe. Democracy, which is the spirit of
rationalism embodied in government forms, is a thing of the past
on the European continent. During the medieval period, Philos-
ophy, as historians have said, was the handmaiden of Theology.
Now, in the modern age, Science, which was to have been the
liberator of all mankind, has taken its place beside both Theology
and Philosophy, and all three minister to that supremely emotional
46 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
entity, the totalitarian state. The utterances of the dictator are
oracular and ï¬nal for manymillions who have abrogated their right
of independent thinking.
InAmerica, the religious groups which have been most success-
ful in gaining adherents in recent years are those which relegate
reason to an unimportant -position in the scheme of moral life.
There is, for example, the Oxford Movement headed byDr. Frank
Buchman. The Buchmanites â€œtalk with God.â€ God tells them what
to do. This, of course, makes everything verysimple, once you
get a wire through to the supreme Deity. One need not think for
himself when one has God for his personal daimon. â€œGod has a
Plan,â€ saythe Oxford enthusiasts, untroubled bythe searching
investigations of philosophers who have not as yet been able to
convince either themselves or anyone of intelligence that a personal,
thinking and planning â€œbeingâ€ can at the same time be omnipresent
and universal-â€”the highest there is. The ethics of the Oxford
Movement are indeed admirableâ€”Absolute Love, Charity, Honesty,
Truthfulnessâ€”but one cannot help remembering that the same
Robespierre who as head of the Committee of Public Safetyin the
Paris Commune murdered thirtymen a day, twelve years previously
had retired from the judgeâ€™s bench in the cityofArras because his
conscience would not permit him to pronounce the sentence of death.
What if Godâ€™s plan should change? The crusades were one of â€œHisâ€
designs, and so was the Spanish Inquisition.
What of the hundreds of oriental seers, yogis and â€œspiritual
teachersâ€ who have invaded the shores ofAmerica during recent
years, gaining for themselves immense personal followings?Almost
without exception, their prospectuses read, â€œGain health, wealth,
happiness bythis new, easy, secret method! Develop your will, your
secret powers, bylearning from me!â€ The emotional exaltation
produced in the devotees of these pseudo-spiritual teachers often
ends in insanityand it cannot fail to warp the intellectual powers
almost beyond repair. The native sages and prophets are not less
numerous, nor less wilyin their methods of exploiting the religious
nature of their fellow men. Correspondence courses in spiritual
development do a thriving business. The ignorant, the naive and the
miserable payan annual toll of millions of dollars to purchase the
â€œsecrets of the ages.â€ There is literallynothing that these mer-
chants of psychic glorywill not promise for a modest fee.
There is no index of modern psychism superior to the magazine
news-stand. Psychic Science, Mysticism, Psychology, Spiritualism,
PSYCHISM TODAY 4.7
Astrology, Mental Healing, Hypnotism-â€”these are but a few gen-
eral labels to indicate the contents of scores of national magazines
with aggregate circulations running into manymillions. The ap-
petite of the wonder-seeking psychic is insatiable. Nothing but the
promise of new and more mysterious miracles will satisfy. Gar-
nished with terms borrowed from the vocabularyof both science
and religion, often spiced with veiled sex appeal, written in the sen-
sational style of yellow journalism, these publications cater to the
most susceptible area of human natureâ€”the psycho-religious hunger
for miracles, for personal salvation, personal power and aggrandise-
ment. More insidious than frank prostitution of the body, the pan-
derers to psychic intoxication are perverting minds and souls en masse.
There are aï¬‚inities between these psychic periodicals and the
numerous picture magazines which have recentlyï¬‚ooded the coun-
try. The latter are essentiallyâ€œpsychicâ€ in character, holding the
attention of the reader through a vivid sense impression instead of
intellectual content. The reading matter is succinct, deï¬nitive, and
impresses the mind of the reader with conclusions which he rarely
questions. No thought is required of the picture-magazine fan; he
sees, is entertained, and he believes. Actually, the picture maga-
zines have appropriated a technique carefullydeveloped through
manyyears of experience byadvertising experts. Picture magazines
use the same principles of attention-getting, fascination, and con-
version to the â€œmessageâ€ of the advertiser that have made fortunes
for so manyof these exploiters of the foibles and weaknesses of
human natureâ€”the psychic nature. The methods of the radio ad-
vertiser are similar, the onlydifference lying in the fact that the
impression is auditoryinstead of visual. The oily, patronizing tones
of the announcersâ€”little better than conï¬dence men who have been
naturalized into respectabilitybythe â€œbignessâ€ of the business en-
terprises theyrepresent, and bythe degrading standards of com-
mercial honestywhich we accept unthinkinglyâ€”lull the listeners into
passive acquiescence. It is all so easy, so effortless! Moving pic-
tures combine both auditoryand visual impressions to make wish-
fulï¬llment dreams for the masses. This is Hollywood's contribu-
tion to the stultiï¬cation of independent thought inAmerica and else-
where. Whyshouldâ€”h0w canâ€”men think, be rational, or survive
as a democratic society, when practicallyall of their leisure time is
spent in absorbing, like so manypsychic sponges, the persuasive and
sensation-producing sights and sounds readilyprovided bythe
â€œpracticalâ€ psychologists of this psychic dispensation?
48 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
A catalogue of the various brands of psychic intoxicants could be
continued indeï¬nitely. The gamut of emotionalism in modern life
includes the familiar exhortations of the revivalist and the respond-
ing ecstasy of his listeners; the uninhibited abandon of youthful
swing enthusiasts in their dervish frenzy; the tense appeals of politi-
cal partisans arousing the dogs of class hatred, the clamor of unsatis-
ï¬ed greed, and all the springs of outraged selï¬shness on which the
demagogue depends for his success. Wherever there is human action
based on the instinctive drives of the animal man, on the hunger for
sensations, on the satisfaction of desires without regard for the con-
sequences, there is psychism unleashed and enthroned. When the
psychic nature reigns, reason never serves as a check, being called
upon only to justify, to rationalize the ï¬ats of the emotions.
What are the consequences of an unregulated emotional life? Of
imagination or fantasy run wild? Of dabbling in â€œmagic,â€ in spir-
itualism and the â€œoccult artsâ€?Ask a psychiatrist this -question, and,
ignorant as he may be of the realities which these labels conceal, he
will relate horrors that would make the tales of Poe sound like
bedtime stories. A writer in Harperâ€™: recently described our time
as â€œTheAge of Schizophrenia,â€ of split-personality, so named be-
cause of the splitting apart of the emotional from the intellectual life
which characterizes the mental state of literally millions of people.
We learn that â€œschizophrenic patients occupy one-ï¬fth of all the
hospital beds in the United States, reckoning in general hospital as
well as in mental hospital beds.â€ Turn to the literature of psychiatry
on the subject of â€œObsession,â€ a term retained from the theories of
obsessing demons believed in in the Dark Ages, and see what -propor-
tion of the victims of this kind of insanity are or have been spiritual-
ists or mediumistically inclined. Find, if you can, the line between
religious fanaticism and actual madness. In the wake of the visiting
yogis and psychic seers are to be found human beings with emotion-
ally shattered lives. They were told that a certain kind of breathing
would bring them knowledgeâ€”they would â€œsee things.â€ They did
the breathing exercises, and now they can't stop seeing things, are
going crazy, or have gone. Others, who thought Hatha Yoga was
â€œspiritual,â€ ï¬nd that their organisms break down under the insidious
discipline. In many such cases, insanity may be a blessing in disguise,
deferring until a later incarnation the moral trial which may then
come at a time when the character of the victim has grown stronger
and more able to withstand psychic temptations.
New forms of psychism are evidenced by bizarre new arrivals in
the ï¬eld of religious cults. The newspapers teem with advertise-
PSYCHISM TODAY 49
ments of swamis, yogis and â€œparamahamsasâ€ who claim to be in
touch with all manner of celestial beings and teachers, whose wisdom
is now for sale, generallyon the easypayment basis. Psychic apos-
tles vie with one another in their claims of knowing the unknowable,
doing the impossible, and revealing everylast secret of the universe.
The more fantastic the claim, the more are attracted as followers,
it appears. We have latelybeen favored with incarnations of Saint
Germain, Jesus, and George VVashington. From Tibet comes a
â€œwhite lama,â€ formerlyofArizona, who promises to relieve the
sophisticated of their ennui byinstruction inAsiatic Mysteries never
before made public. Others join religious with political appeals, and
allege that a corps of statisticians and researchers are now perfect-
ing the blueprints for a new â€œplannedâ€ (magic word!) society.
Who can wonder that, a few years ago, when Orson Welles pro-
duced a Martian invasion on his radio program, listeners from
Florida to Oregon rushed distractedlyabout, wondering how to
protect themselves from these horrid visitors out of the sky, and
even a college professor or two went out to look for them some-
where in the Jerseymeadows!
In I939, Walter Lip-pmann, with a wisdom he could hardlyhave
himself understood, named the tragic victims of modern psychism
â€œthe spiritual proletariat of the modern age.â€ Theyâ€œhear all the
latest news and all the latest opinions, but have no philosophyby
which theycan distinguish the true from the false, the credible from
the incredible, the good from the bad.â€ And, he adds, â€œthe eruption
of their volcanic and hysterical energyis the revolution that is
shaking the world.â€
II
Here, inAmerica, a great psychic mutation is under way, the full
developments of which maynot disclose themselves for scores of
years. Now, at its outset, little more is visible than the paroxysms
of the decline of an old order, the backwash and carnage of a
world that has lost its sense of legitimate purpose. Modern writers
have habituated themselves to think of this transition in political
terms, founding their judgments of what the future holds on theories
of societywhich had their beginning in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries. But the change which the human race is entering upon is
more profound byfar than anymere political alteration. When it
is complete, new concepts of realitywill have emerged and won ac-
ceptance, and tomorrowâ€™s social order will have adapted itself to
laws of human relations as yet onlyguessed at bythe few.
5o CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
The biological analogyof â€œmutationâ€ is a good one, for this
change, according to the Theosophical view, will mark a fundamental
alteration in the inter-relation of the principles of manâ€™s psychic
organism. One of its results will be general recognition that man
is not merelya physical being, but is more essentiallyan embodied
mind, embodied feelings, hopes, aspirations and desires. These
principles, in the cycle to come, will be acknowledged as the primary
attributes of human beings, and the orbits of scientiï¬c and religious
investigation will thus attain new orientation. But, as with everyre-
alignment of the evolutionaryforces, an epoch of confusion, of false
starts and misguided attempts to anticipate the course of natural
development, will inevitablyprecede the ï¬nal adjustment of the
race to this new period of human growth and self-expression.
Destruction and failure will seem to be predominant characteristics
of the cycle, and despair the watchword of the many. For those
whose horizons are circumscribed to the past, whose philosophies
are rigidlycommitted to the old assumptions of western civilization,
the change will seem to mark the â€œend of the world,â€ and indeed it
will, for them. Like the dreamer too suddenlyawakened from his
slumber, like the miser impoverished bya single miscalculation, like
the child called upon to be and act as a man when he has neither
the knowledge, nor the courage nor the strength, the opening of this
new vista in human aï¬airs will drive manyinto the current of eï¬lux,
where theywill cling to the shattered fragments of the past as the
onlysymbol theyknow of the life that was.
But for others, the epoch will be recognized as a mightychallenge
to their moral resources and their self-reliance. The ascending torch
of human intelligence will meet the intenser ï¬‚ame of egoic divinity
in its descent to a more complete participation in the life on earth.
An age of builders will dawn, of educators and healers, without pre-
cedent or comparison in the historyof present humanity. This is the
message and the prophecyofTheosophy, brought to the world to
lighten the wayto the â€œnew order of ages,â€ and to ease the travail
of its birth.
Hence the warnings, the strict injunctions of the Teacher, H. P.
Blavatsky. She took no morbid delight in spreading a Jeremiad
doctrine of fear and retribution. She but repeated what she knew
of the eternal law of cycles, upraised and proclaimed out of the
lore of the perfected men of the race, whose wisdom and practical
knowledge of cyclic evolution alone can bring humanitythrough the
terrible dangers of the transition age. Speaking toAmerican theoso-
PSYCHISM TODAY 51
phists of the last century, she told of these dangers, and of the
opportunities for service that are unfolding in the present:
As the preparation for the new cycle proceeds, as the fore-runners
of the new sub-race make their appearance on the American con-
tinent, the latent psychic and occult powers in man are beginning to
germinate and grow. . . . Your position as the fore-runners has its
own special perils as well as its special advantages. Psychism, with
all its allurements and all its dangers, is necessarily developing among
you, and you must beware lest the Psychic outrun the Manasic and
Spiritual development. Psychic capacities held perfectly under con-
trol, checked and directed by the Manasic principle, are valuable aids
in development. But these capacities running riot, controlling instead
of controlled, using instead of being used, lead the Student into the
most dangerous delusions and certainty of moral destruction. Watch
therefore carefully this development, inevitable in your race and
evolution-period so that it may ï¬nally work for good and not for
evil; and receive, in advance, the sincere and potent blessings of
Those whose good-will will never fail you, if you do not fail your-
selves. . . .
Theosophy alone can save the Western world from that selï¬sh
and unbrotherly feeling that now divides race from race, one nation
from the other; and from that hatred of class and social considera-
tions that are the curse and disgrace of so-called Christian peoples.
Theosophy alone can save it from sinking entirely into that mere
luxurious materialism in which it will decay and putrefy as civiliza-
tions have done. In your hands, brothers, is placed in trust the wel-
fare of the coming century; and great as is the trust, so great is
also the responsibility.
There is nothing â€œevilâ€ or â€œwickedâ€ in the psychic nature itself.
The evil results from lack of control, from the free indulgence of
desire which, when unleashed and increasingly gratiï¬ed, becomes
insatiable in its demands. The more the powers of mind are de-
veloped, the more extensive become the responsibilities of man, and
the greater the crimes of which he is capable. Misuse of mental
powers, and here misuse means selï¬sh use, is incalculably more far-
reaching in its destructive effects than the abuse of physical powers.
Uncontrol, which is the veritable root of psychism, leads to progres-
sive stages of irresponsible exercise of powers, ending in brutal lack
of concern for the welfare of others, if for no other reason than that
the existence of those others has been forgotten during the ever
more engrossing pursuit for satisfaction. The selï¬shness and narrow
partisanships of a civilization founded on material and physical
-powers are as the petty sins of children when compared with the
52 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
possible applications of psychic powers for selï¬sh ends during the
cycle to come. A point is reached in the union of desire with intel-
lect and the subtler forms of psychic perception, when rationalization
of selï¬shness becomes absolute. This is the death of all morality,
and the beginning of a deliberate career in evil for evilâ€™s sake. The
only protection against such a fate for the human race is the practice
of moral discipline, and the study of Theosophy, the philosophy
which will convince mankind that such discipline is both necessary,
just and desirable. Comprehensive grasp of the hidden laws of
nature, even intellectually, is not possible without thorough investi-
gation of the Theosophical teachings as a whole.
For example, the cyclic character of psychic manifestations is de-
pendent on the Theosophical teaching of the three lines of evolution,
and the successive emphasis which the course of human development
places upon the principles involved in these divisions. A passage
from the Ocean of Theosophy will illustrate:
We ï¬nd Theosophy teaching that at the present point of man's
evolution he is a fully developed quaternary with the higher principles
partly developed. Hence it is taught that to-day man shows himself
to be moved by passion and desire. This is proved by a glance at the
civilizations of the earth, for they are all moved by this principle,
and in countries like France, England, and America a gloriï¬cation of
it is exhibited in the attention to display, to sensuous art, to struggle
for power and place, and in all the habits and modes of living where
gratiï¬cation of the senses is sometimes esteemed the highest good.
But as Mind is being evolved more and more as we proceed in
our course along the line of race development, there can be perceived
in all countries the beginning of the transition from the animal pos-
sessed of the germ of real mind to the man of mind complete. This
day is therefore known as the â€œtransition period,â€ when every system
of thought, science, religion, government, and society is changing, and
menâ€™s minds are only preparing for an alteration. Man is not yet
fully conscious, and reincarnations are needed to at last complete the
incarnation of the whole trinity (the higher, spiritual man) in the
body. When that has been accomplished the race will have become
as gods.
The mysteries of psychic phenomena are to be accounted for by
the as yet imperfect incarnation of mind, which is a progressive de-
scent, and which re-quires a corresponding aspiration and striving on
the part of mankind. It is because the full powers of mind are not
yet active in the race that the scientist is wandering in the dark, con-
founded and confused by all that hypnotism and other strange things
bring before him. Because these powers are withheld until the appro-
PSYCHISM TODAY 53
priate evolutionary cycle, the learned are compelled to speak of the
â€œsubconscious mind,â€ the â€œunconscious,â€ and the like. Hence, also,
the bewilderment of both scientists and theologians, when, in the
last century, the ï¬‚ood tide of psychism broke loose over the American
continent. But, as in each cycle more and more of the higher powers
of man will become accessible, greater knowledge, and power, too,
will become possible. Finally, with full power and responsibility,
with minds fully illuminated, all men will be compelled to choose
between good and evil ways, the one leading to heights of spiritual
achievement in the common brotherhood of man, the other path,
dark with selï¬shness, to moral ruin.
Writing in 1893, William Q. Judge expressed the hope that â€œby
the time the next tide begins to rise, the West will have gained some
right knowledge of the true philosophy of Man and Nature, and
be then ready to bear the lifting of the veil a little more.â€ That tide
is now upon us, and to help on the progress of the race to a better
knowledge of psychic evolutionâ€”its extraordinary promise, if un-
derstood, for the good of mankind, and its terrible dangers, if al-
lowed to proceed in ignorant selï¬shnessâ€”is the object of this
pamphlet.

UNVEILED: A Master-Key to the Mysteries of Ancient and
Modern Science and Theology. By H. P. BLAVATSKY
This exhaustive study of Religion and Science in the light of Theosophy was
the ï¬rst presentation of the Wisdom Religion to the Western World. It
devotes many chapters to the phenomena of Spiritualism, both of the nine-
teenth century and of other periods. No thoughtful reader can put down
this work without having gained enormously in understanding of many
important subjects which are wholly neglected in the usual histories of
religious and scientiï¬c thought up to the present.
Vol. Iâ€”SCIENCE, xlv-i-628 pages. Vol. IIâ€”THEOLOGY, iv+64o pages.

THE OCEAN OF THEOSOPHY By WILLIAM Q. JUDGE
An epitome of the Theosophical Philosophy designed to serve the needs of
the ordinary reader. Over a period of thirty years, this book has proved
its value as the text used by study classes in Theosophy in many parts of the
world. While briefer than the works of Madame Blavatsky, the Ocean
provides a comprehensive view of the entire system, is easy to understand
and gives thorough and adequate treatment of the great problems of evolu-
tion and human destiny.

THE LAWS OF HEALING: Physical and Metaphysical
Despite the many advances of modern medicine and the enormous sums
spent in laboratory experimentation and research, the physical and mental
ills of civilization increase year by year. A leading physician engaged in
public health work recently pointed out that half the deaths now taking
place in the United States are caused by chronic di.reaseâ€”-â€œa plague of as
great a proportion as any to which mankind has been subject.â€ The rise in
psychic and mental disorders in our time is well known. The La=ws of
Healing, while making no quack promises of miraculous recovery, offers in
brief space the fundamental principles of health in body and soul. It also
provides an analysis of the various doctrines of â€œmind cure," and the
popular â€œgerm theory of diseaseâ€ is critically examined.

WHERE ARE THE DEAD? Theosophy Versus Spiritualism
With the decline of orthodoxy in religious beliefs, unprejudiced inquiry
into the meaning of death becomes possible. Today men seek a rational
faith in immortality to replace the complacent acceptance of dogmas which
stultify instead of stimulating the mind. This pamphlet is intended to serve
independent search for soul-knowledge. It presents the foundation of a
philosophy of spiritual existence for the human ego, whether embodied or
disembodied. The claims of the Spiritualists are contrasted with the
Theosophical doctrine of immortality; and psychic laws, forces and phe-
nomena are explained in relation to the processes of Reincarnation.
