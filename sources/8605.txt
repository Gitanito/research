She realizes she is going to   				die and receives hope and comfort through nightly conversations   				with her favorite doll Angel, who helps her embrace a new   				perspective on dying and the possibility that consciousness may   				survive after death. Her fear of death is ultimately lifted by   				new-found spiritual wisdom and by the account of a near-death   				experience told to her by a young companion.

Evelyn Elsaesser   				Valarino's extensive knowledge of near-death experiences informs   				this astonishing book. It will be of great benefit and comfort   				to those facing their own death, or for parents and care-givers   				of those with serious illnesses. It will also enrich anyone who   				is reflecting on this essential aspect of life.
