  		              		Experience Description   

    On May 11, of 2020, I was at work.  I'm a firefighter/EMT. I work 48-hour shifts and this was my second day of work. At approximately 4 a.m., I had some chest discomfort but disregarded it. At 7 a.m., I ended my shift and went home. My wife normally leaves for work around 2:30 p.m. in the afternoon. I complained about a little shortness of breath. But, again disregarded this as  just being tired. My wife told me that if my chest pain got any worse to call our daughter, who is a nurse. She could  come check on me since she lives nearby.  My daughter called shortly after that to see if I needed her to come over. I told her that I was o.k.
  
  About 5 minutes after that phone call, out of nowhere, I had the feeling like something very heavy was sitting on my chest.   I was sitting  in a forward position, taking in as many deep breaths as I could. It started to scare me.  I was home all by myself, so I made the decision to  call 911.  Then, I text my daughter and wife and told them I needed an ambulance. My daughter and wife both beat the ambulance to our home.  On the way to the hospital, the paramedics gave me an albuterol breathing treatment, which seem to have helped at first. The ambulance ride was very short.
  
  When I arrived at the hospital, I felt a little better knowing that I was at the hospital.  I received another breathing treatment. When that treatment was done, which was about 15 minutes after my arrival, I was telling a nurse that I was having still having problems  breathing. The nurse told me to wait because  I would be getting another treatment in about 45 minutes. Then  she left the room. The breathing got worsse, so I pushed the emergency room button.  I could take in air but couldn't exhale. An emergency room doctor walked in and yelled for assistance.  They rushed me to another room where they had more technical equipment. There were two  emergency room doctors trying to give me some sort of drugs through an IV in each arm. I could tell that if I took in one more breath, it would be my last.  I  told myself, 'This is it!'
  
  The next thing I know, I am floating really high above the most amazing forest I had ever seen. It went on for miles. Off in the distance, was   a beautiful lake that was calm with  no waves. I felt no pain. I was moving, but at a very slow pace. I felt like I wanted to be in this place.  I had no worries.

  But in the blink of the eye,  I was back in the hospital bed.  The emergency room doctor was telling me how lucky I was, and that I would need to stay in the hospital for a few days because  I was positive for COVID-19. I was then put on a bypass machine to help my breathing. The emergency room doctor told me that he would  call my wife and update her on my progress.  He also said that if I was not better by the time he comes back, that I would need to go on a ventilator.
  
  My breathing did get better and after 4 days I was able to go home and quarantine for 2 weeks.

  I now have a different outlook on death; not so much fear anymore.
