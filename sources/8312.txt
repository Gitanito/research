  		              		Experience Description   

    In September 2017, I had an infection in my foot and leg for a few days. It became so painful, I had to go to the accident and emergency clinic in the late evening. I was admitted to the main hospital that was 17 miles away. My diagnosis was cellulitis that had then caused septicemia. I was drifting in and out of consciousness that night. 
  
  Several hours later, in the night, I was conscious as I heard a female voice coming from near my left shoulder. There was absolutely zero room for even a child to stand in that space. The voice was kindly. I opened my eyes. At what would be waist level if I'd been standing up, there was a tunnel of light. It looked a bit like a vortex in the middle of the space by the right side of my bed. It was so soft looking, like down on a baby chick.  It was the softest thing I have ever seen. There was a sense of movement, such that if you went into the tunnel,  you'd be moved up. There was the most wonderful sense of supernatural peace. It is  hard to put into words. I was not at all afraid and it all seemed utterly natural. The voice said, 'You can come if you want to, but you can never come back.' This voice was supernaturally kind and peaceful too. I immediately and without thinking said,'No, I must stay. My children need me.' I have 3 children who were  ages  19, 17 and 15 at the time. Immediately, but gently, the voice and the vortex disappeared.
