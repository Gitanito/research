This book was written and originally pub­
lished by its author many years ago. Like rare
wine, its value has multiplied with age.
The original “Dr. Q book” was the first all-
revealing book of professional mindreading secrets,
and the basic principles then exposed are so funda­
mentally sound today that it becomes the duty of
the House of Nelson to re-publish this masterful
book, in a deluxe edition, that its teachings may
be perpetuated.
It is sufficient to say that the author, C. Alex­
ander, internationally known a decade ago as “The
Man Who Knows", accumulated over one million
dollars as a professional stage mindreader, hyno-
tist and magician. His keen mind and the appli­
cation of these methods as a stage performer were
years in advance, and so sound and basically true
as these teaching today that it is the publisher’s
desire to again make available this rare informa­
tion and valuable data to the profession at large.
It is not beyond the realm of possibility that
another will follow in the footsteps of the author,
and duplicate his phenomenal success.

PREFACE
In presenting this book to the magical fraternity
and the world at large, the author wishes it dis­
tinctly understood that he neither affirms nor
denies the existence of psychic and spiritual
phenomena, because it would certainly be taking
in’ too much territory for him to refute state­
ments made by Sir Oliver Lodge, Sir William
Crookes, Russell Wallace, Professor Hyslop, Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle, and hundreds of professors
in various seats of learning, who all affirm that
our dead do communicate with us through raps,
automatic writing, mediumship, etc. Also that
they may be seen materialized, as we knew them,
in the flesh; that they speak through the lips of
others, but in their own tones and accents; that
they speak directly through trumpets, hung in
mid-air by no human hands; that they levitate
heavy bodies and remove sleeved garments from
mediums, whose hands are held by skeptics. The
time has now come, it seems to me, not to refute
these scientists, but to separate the wheat from
the chaff, or the real from the unreal, so that we
all may know what to believe.
Therefore, it is the purpose of the author, in
presenting this book, to deal only with that which
he knows to be counterfeit, so that it may help in
the research of genuine psychic phenomena.

INTRODUCTION
In 1910, while playing in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, I had the
pleasure of meeting a gentleman, whom we will in the future
refer to as Dr. “Q".
He was, of all the rogues and scoundrels I have ever en­
countered in my professional life, the confidence man “par ex­
cellence”, as the French would say; not by the excellence of his
high charatcer, to be sure, or his moral worth, but by his artistic
superiority.
t
In this country he celebrated himself under many aliases,
which he used as fancy or occasion directed. He witnessed all
of my performances, while in Honduras, and we became very
friendly. His one regret always seemed to be, in his telling me
the story of his life and different experiences, that he had dis­
obeyed the laws of the land and was so closely hunted by officials
that he dared not set foot back in the States. He was doomed
to spend the rest of his days in exile, away from home and
friends.
Dr. “Q” was no small man in his way. He was a handsome
man too, possessing a finely shaped face, with large, dark, not
quite black eyes and eyelashes, such as would arouse the en­
thusiasm of the master painters and which gave to those eyes
that sweet alluring expression so irresistible to women; or when
reflecting the light of anger from them added a two-fold horror
tp their expression, enough to make the strongest man quail,
for the man seemed then a very demon. The Doctor was about
five feet ten inches in height, elegantly proportioned, his form
being perhaps as nearly perfect in every respect as any man on
this wide globe could boast of. Grace, dignity and strength
combined in it, and when at all aroused Dr. “Q” was as lithe and
flexible as a cat, or better perhaps, a tiger.
This marvelous fellow could imitate anything from the
grimace of a pretty simpering girl to the Falstaffian stolidity of
a Dutch judge, and was one of the most excellent story tellers
in consequence. He dressed faultlessly and never, never over­
dressed. He played the part of the literary savant to perfection.
The ladies doted on him and the men—which was regrettable—
lent him money. So much for the personality of this capital
villain.

10 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q'
He was born in 1860, and it was the intention of his people
to educate him for the ministry, but when seventeen years of
age his mind turned towards dramatic art, and he ran away
from home with a little “fly-by-night” stock company. He re­
mained with them ten months and was discharged in Galveston,
Texas, for making too violent love to the daughter of the man­
ager of the company, leaving him stranded in a strange city,
with but fifteen dollars in his pocket.
He was so desperately in love with the girl, who had left
with the company, that he walked the streets night and day, and
one afternoon he stopped in front of a psychic palmist and
clairvoyant’s office on Tremont street. He read in the window
of the marvels this great clairvoyant could do, such as telling
full names and dates, bringing about your greatest wish, reunit­
ing the separated, and causing the one that you love to love
you, etc. This, of course, in his worried state of mind, appealed
very strongly to him, and he decided to go in and test the
powers of this great man.
On entering, he was requested to write on a slip of paper
his full name and occupation, and the three questions that he
most desired to know. This he did, and the medium grasped
his hand, looked him in the gye, called him by his full name,
and told him that he was in a very worried state of mind, very
deeply in love with a wonderful girl, but that the magnetic con­
ditions surrounding him were all wrong and that he would have
no peace of mind, nor the return of the love from this wonderful
girl, until these magnetic conditions were straightened out; but,
that he, the medium, for a fee of $10.00 could furnish him with
a subtle powder which he could take home and bum, and all
would be well.
This of course seemed very plausible to the youngster, for
had not the great medium been able to tell him his full name,
and the great secret worry that was gnawing at his heart. If
this wonderful thing were possible, it undoubtedly would also
be possible for the medium to make all conditions right, so Dr.
“Q” gave the medium his last ten dollars, leaving him with only
three dollars in his pocket, and at that moment the die was cast
that started Dr. “Q” upon his nefarious career as' a fake medium
and confidence man. After giving the medium the money he
was given in return a little package of incense and told to go
home and bum this at twelve o’clock each evening for a week,
and that all would then come well. The youngster took the
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q” 11
package of incense, rented a fifty-cent room and that night at
twelve o’clock burned a little of the incense as he was directed,
and as he did so common sense asserted itself, and showed him
how improbable it was that this could have any effect upon a
girl and her father who were by this time in Houston, many
miles away. He came to a realization of the fact that the medium
had duped him, and that he had’been tricked. The following
morning he was in a very avengeful frame of mind, and as soon
as the pawnshops were open he pawned his watch and pur­
chased a cheap pistol, and proceeded immediately to the ren­
dezvous of the medium, entered and brushed aside the curtains
to the private sanctum sanctorium of the medium, drew the gun,
leveled it at the medium’s head, and demanded his ten dollars.
This the medium immediately handed him. He then demanded
that the medium explain to him how he had been able to tell
him his name, and his questions. -There seeming to be no al­
ternative for the medium, with the gun pointed at his head, he
explained that after Dr. “Q” had written his name and questions
on the paper and folded it up, that he, .the medium, had then
quickly exchanged the pellet for a dummy one, which he burned
in front of the youngster, and while the boy was watching it
burn he had unfolded the real pellet in his lap and read what
was written on same. Thus he was able to convince all of his
dupes. It was so simple it was laughable. The pistol was put
away, all enmity was forgotten, and the boy and the medium
became good friends. The medium realizing the boy possessed
a wonderful personality, and. seemingly not afraid of a buzzsaw,
offered him the opportunity of becoming his assistant, and from
then on his life was just one trick after another, sometimes In
jail, sometimes with thousands of dollars in his pockets and the
pampered pet of society, until the day I met him, like a hunted
beast, making his last stand, an outcast in Tegucigalpa, Hon­
duras.
In the following pages I will give many of his experiences,
methods of operation, etc., as well as the methods of many other
famous fraudulent mediums whom I have met.
CRYSTAL GAZING
Crystal gazing is very ancient. History tells us that there
is no country that did not have its seers or crystal gazers. Some
looked into a sphere of crystal, and some looked into a sphere
of glass, or some similar substance, and endeavored to see within
the pictures or images which apparently presented themselves'
in it while thus gazing.
The Egyptians used a crystal in their practice of divination,
and throughout history we find traces of this art. History tells
us that Alexander the Great had a crystal in his lighthouse at
Alexandria, Egypt, supposedly made by Aristotle. This crystal,
or gazing ball, was supposedly made of gold, silver, copper, and
brass, and it was supposed that he was able to tell by gazing
into it, when ships were two or three days’ journey at sea com­
ing to attack him.
In the middle ages it was again revived, especially by the
celebrated Dr. Dee, who lived during the time of Queen Eliza­
beth of England. His crystal, or gazing ball, is now in the
British museum.
In more recent times, crystal gazing has been made a sub­
ject of study by the Psychological Research Societies, and many
books have been published on the subject It is very simple,
and conceded to be the safest means of psychic development
It is not necessary to use a crystal or gazing ball. Any polished
object should bring about the same results.
On account of so deep an interest having been taken in this
work, it, like all other things, has been counterfeited, until, at
the present time, it is almost impossible to distinguish the
fraudulent from the genuine. It is my purpose in this article
to deal only with the fraudulent, believing in so doing it will
materially assist psychological research societies in distinguish­
ing between the real and the counterfeit.
Crystal gazing of the fraudulent kind is used in many dif­
ferent ways. Many times it is used merely as a matter of clean,
wholesome entertainment, by an honest magician or artist whose
sole object is to mystify and entertain, and desires his work
considered so.
1Z
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q” 13
Then again, it is used by a class of charlatans for a sup­
posedly magical entertainment, but with the sole object in view
of getting a superstitious class of people into their power, and
thus bleed them from their last dollar through the practice of
this method of chicanery.
It is used also by another class of charlatans for private
office work, where they are supposedly able to call up spirits
of the departed and have them give messages to the living
through the aid of the crystal, for which a very large fee is fre­
quently charged.
In all of these fraudulent methods of presenting the act,
the medium, as we will in the future call him, has but three ob­
jects in mind. The first is to learn what the dupes desire to
know; the second is to be able to get this information into their
possession unbeknown to the dupe, and the third is to be able
to get as much money as possible for so doing, regardless of the
effect that it may have upon his dupes.
Of getting the questions, there are many different methods.
Unless a silent or a spoken code is used, the dupes are always
requested to write their questions. One method of obtaining this
writing, as you will see later on under heading of the “Anna
Eva Fay Act,” is by use of the waxed pads. A second method
is to have a large number of boosters in the audience, who in­
gratiate themselves into the confidence of the audience until
they are able to learn their questions and thus give them to the
medium. A third method is to have the questions written by the
audience or dupes upon pieces of paper, and then exchanged in
what is known as a switch bag, or changing biag. A fourth
method is by a changing basket. A fifth method is by gathering
the questions, placing them in a brass urn upon a table on the
stage, supposedly burning them, but in reality passing them
through the base of the table, through a trap in the stage, and
into the hands of the medium’s confederate. A sixth method is
by having the audience write upon pieces of paper that are held
upon a clip board, and inside of the board, which is covered with
paper representing wood, is a carbon paper and white sheet of
paper. A seventh method is to have the questions gathered by
the assistant, and as they are going to the boxes to collect ques­
tions, the real questions are placed in their pockets, and the
duplicates substituted in their hands. For the eighth method
questions are written at home, and upon entering the theatre
14 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q"
they are gathered up by an assistant, who supposedly takes them
to the stage, but easily changes them when out of sight.
These methods can be varied from time to time, so that it
would be hard to say positively just exactly what was used at
any individual performance.
Now that the medium, or his confederate, has the questions -
in his possession, the next and most important thing is to be
able to get this information to the medium upon the stage, and
eliminate the suspicions of the audience that he could have
possibly seen the questions and memorized them. This is gener­
ally done by the performer, or medium, remaining upon the
stage at all times. The questions are communicated to him by
one of the following methods, leaving the audience under the
impression that the questions have been always before them,
because, as a rule, except the burning method, or the waxed pad
method, the duplicate questions are placed on the stage, in full
view of the audience. _ •
Perhaps the oldest method of the communication of the in­
formation from the confederate to the medium upon the stage, is
by having the medium sit in a chair, close to the footlights, and
then allow himself to be covered by a sheet, and immediately
the covering is placed upon him, he will start to call names of
the writers of the questions, and in a roundabout way, give the
answers. This is accomplished-by having a rubber hose run
through a small hole in the stage, and the moment the medium
is covered by the sheet he reaches down, pulls up the tube, and
puts it to his ear, and at the opposite end is the confederate,
who has a ten' cent tin funnel shoved into the end of the hose,
and into this he reads the questions. Dr. “Q” once related a
very peculiar experience he had while using this method. Busi­
ness had been very bad, and he was unable to pay salaries on
time. Nevertheless, his confederates believed that he was pos­
sessed of a considerable sum of money. So as soon as they had
gathered the questions, and were down under the stage, and the
learned professor was under the sheet, and had the hose up to
his ear, the confederate said: “Doctor, reach in your pocket and
drop your wallet directly behind your chair, or we will not allow
this hose to be passed back down through the stage again, and
you will be exposed.” The Doctor was helpless, so he fumbled
around the sheet, got his purse, and dropped it back of his chair
on the stage. One of the confederates stepped out, and while
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q” IS
supposedly adjusting the sheet, picked up the purse, and the
performance went merrily on.
At this time, the Doctor was using for the latter part of his
entertainment hypnotic work, and as he was a fake hypnotist,
the same as he was a fake medium, he was always subjected to
many curious experiences. The following he related to me as
having happened in the city of B--------, Montana:
“My show had gone on the rocks in Canada, and I was just
able to get over the line to B--------, and at that time only had
one assistant. On landing in B--------, my total capital was
twenty-five cents, but we had been booked at the opera house,
and the advertising was out, and we looked forward to a very
good house. So I gave my capital of twenty-five cents to my
assistant, and told him to go and get supper, and also to fix ten
or twelve boys to act as hypnotic subjects. As a rule, he was
able to do this for fifty cents each, and we usually paid them
after each performance. By fixing them, I mean he would go to
them and tell them that they could see the show free, and re­
ceive fifty cents, if they would come upon the stage and do just
exactly as the professor told them. If he told them to go to
sleep, they were to pretend to go to sleep; if he told them to
place their hands together so that they could not open them, pull
as they might, they were supposed to place their hands together,
and under no condition be able to pull them apart. My assistant
returned to the theatre a few moments before the curtain went
up, and we had a packed house, as we carried wonderful billing
matter, and the first act of my performance, which consisted of
billet reading under the sheet, by way of the rubber hose, went
off in wonderful shape, except for a huskiness in the voice of
my assistant that I noticed through the hose, which was seem­
ingly caused from him having perhaps used the twenty-five
cents that I had given him for liquor, and then dined upon the
free lunch, which was a wonderful asset in those days for a
showman who was short. I made my opening speech, introduc­
ing hypnotism, and requested the audience for subjects. Four­
teen came upon the stage. They were well dressed, white collars
and polished shoes, and I wondered how my confederate had
been able to get such wonderful looking young men to come up.
But he had firmly assured me before the performance that he
had fixed a swell bunch of subjects, and I naturally took his
word for it. I had them all seated, in a semi-circle, and stepped
to the first one, had him place his hands together, looked him
16 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q'
square in the eye, and told him that it would be an impossibility
for him to take his hands apart. With a silly grin he immedi­
ately took them apart. I tried this experiment with all of the
subjects, and every one of them immediately took their hands
apart after having them clasped together. The house was packed
to the doors, and the audience commenced to hiss me, and I real­
ized there was something wrong. I took a look in the wings, and
there was my assistant snoozing soundly. I had one of the boys
of the committee stand up, went through the actions of hypno­
tising him, and told him that he would gradually find himself
falling forward. But he remained erect. Then with both hands
I grasped his head, and gradually rubbed my thumbs over his
eyelids, to allay the suspicions of my audience, and I said to
him, 'Are you not next?’ He said back to me: 'No, next to
what?’ I said: ‘Go to sleep then, and do as I tell you, and I will
give you $5.00.’ He said: ‘I should say not; go ahead and put me
to sleep—you are the learned professor, so let me see you do it.’
I bade him be seated, as I saw it was useless. The audience had
begun to get noisy, and noisier, and were commencing to give
me the horselaugh. As I walked by the wings I kicked my as­
sistant oh the shins, and he awoke. I then supposedly attempted
to put the boy nearest the wings to sleep, but in place of talking
to the boy, whose eyes I was rubbing in a mesmeric sort of
fashion, I was saying to my assistant: ‘I am going to kill you
when I get off this stage.’ He said, 'What is the trouble?’ I said:
‘You have done a pretty job of fixing; don’t you hear the audi­
ence out there, like hungry, wolves. There is not one of this
bunch will go to sleep, and there is over $400.00 in the house, and
we haven’t got a cent to our names, and I can see where we are
going to get killed.’ He said: ‘Don’t worry Profess, I’ll fix it,1
and in a sort of stupor he got up and walked around in the
wings, and a moment later appeared in the wings with an old
prop musket. This he leveled at my bunch of subjects from the
wings, the audience of course, could not see him, and he said:
'Step lively there, you bunch of bums, and do exactly as the
professor tells you. The next bird that don’t go to sleep or do
exactly as the professor tells him, I propose to blow him into
eternity.’ And it certainly had its effect, because every one of
the subjects did exactly as I told them from then on, and the
audience went wild with delight, and I also went wild wonder­
ing what the finish was going to be. After presenting all of my
stunts, my assistant let the curtain drop, with the subjects upon
the stage, and he stepped out among them and said, ‘Boys, th
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q” 17
joke was on you, wasn't it?' And through a fast line of conver­
sation we squared all the boys up, telling them what a wonder­
ful part they had taken, and how much amusement they had
given the audience, and took them out to dinner after the per­
formance—of course, after I had first gone to the box office and
got from the local manager my share of the receipts. And I do
not believe that any of the subjects who were intimidated with
an old rusty prop musket from that day to this has never
breathed a word of what came dose to being my Waterloo."
Another method of conveying the questions from the confed­
erate to the medium, is by having a kitchen chair, the back
round of which is made of gas pipe; the medium carries in his
pocket a little rubber hose that connects to an opening in same,
and the confederate under the stage connects a rubber hose to
the bottom of the gas pipe, which acts as one of the legs of the
chair. The reading by this method is also done under the sheet.
But these methods are a thing of the past, as the knowledge of
same quickly became common property.
Another method that has also become old, is the method of
using wires, as per illustration shown elsewhere.
Another method has been the use of a telephone, the per­
former still working under a sheet, but having a telephone re­
ceiver in his pocket, wires running down his trouser legs to
copper plates upon the soles of his shoes, two spikes running
through the stage, these spikes being connected by wires run­
ning to the dressing room, where the confederate speaks into a
transmitter, and thus the medium is given the information.
THE TURBAN METHOD
The accompanying illustration should give a very clear ex­
planation as to how same is accomplished. The medium is
dressed in the robes of an oriental seer, loose, flowing gown and
Turkish shoes, on the bottom of which are copper plates con­
nected to wires that run up over his body and connect to two
glove fasteners at the back of his collar. These glove fasteners
are sewed securely to the outer collar of the robe, and the
collar is spangled around the edge, so that they are not noticed.
The turban conceals a watchcase telephone receiver, and the
two wires running from same run down into the tail of the
turban to two more glove fasteners, and are thus attached to
18 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q”
the collar. The idea of the glove fasteners is to assist in form­
ing the connection between the wires from the shoes and the
wires from the receiver so that the medium can remove his
turban at will, thus proving to the audience that it would be
impossible for him to be getting the information by wires. Spikes
are driven through the stage, and connected to wires running
to the dressing room where the confederate has the questions,
and transmits same through the transmitter to the medium. The
medium does not need to remain in one spot, because, as a rule,
they have wires connected to runways that run down each of
the stage. Some of these runways have tinsel cord woven
through them, so that when he steps upon same with his copper-
soled shoes, he can gain information from the dressing room.
Another method is to simply have the wires run down to
nails that are driven in the wood runways, and then the tops
of these nails are cut off, and when the carpet is placed over
them they protrude through the carpet, and as the medium steps
upon them he immediately gets in connection with the confed­
erate.
Another very ingenious method, as shown in the accom­
panying illustration, is to have wires stretched on the bottom
side of the carpet, and every few inches over this wire split rivets
are driven through the carpet. These are then opened up with a
little instrument like a cold chisel, and hammered flat, so that
when the medium steps upon these he again gets a connection.
An oriental design in the carpet, with plenty of color the same as
the rivets, effectually hides the rivets, and the back of this carpet
can be lined with canvas, and the medium can jerk up these
carpets, supposedly proving that there are no wires or mechan­
ism concealed. At the finish of his performance, he can remove
his turban and answer ten or twelve questions, as these, as a
rule, are copied flat on a fan that he carries in his possession.
But this method, like any other where wires are used, is fraught
with a great deal of danger. A gentleman who presented this
act for a number of years, told me of several very miserable ex­
periences that he had with same. Frequently, someone would
get onto his method, because it is a well known fact you can
fool some of the people all of the time, but you can’t fool all of
the people all of the time. They would either sneak around
and cut his wires, or pour water upon the stage, which would
make a short connection, as was done one evening with him.
A party connected two wires to his nails, then carried them out

receiver, and as his assistant tied this around his head, with
the blindfold over his eyes, he connected a wire running from
the receiver to the wires at the back of his collar that connected
with the copper-soled shoes, nails, wires, and the dressing room;
also tinsel cord running down the runways. But this method
was too obvious for any intelligent person, and this wonderful
medium’s show “went on the rocks,” and he immediately tried
doing an expose, posing as a reformed medium, but his expose
was as bad as his supposedly real mediumistic stunt. And the
last we heard of him was when we understood that the chief of
police of a certain western city told him that if he could see
into his future as far as he, the chief, could, that he would have
a railroad ticket a hundred yards long, and have half of it used
already.
Still, we know of another medium who took this same
method and in place of the copper soles on his shoes he had a
thin sole placed over the copper plates, and would soak these
shoes in a solution of magnesium chloride for about three hours
every day, so that when he stepped upon the spikes he would
still get the connection through the soles to the copper plates.
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q" 21
THE INDUCTION METHOD
This method, as you will readily see by the illustration, needs
no copper-soled shoes, nor wires in the runway; also the para­
phernalia upon the body of the performer is self-contained, as
you will see in the illustration. One or two 1000-ohm thin tele­
phone receivers connected to one hundred turns of number thirty
magnet wire are concealed in the turban, and a ten-foot circle
containing twenty turns of number sixteen bell cord wire is con­
cealed under the stage, or under a rug upon the stage. The two
wires leading from this circle connect directly to the dressing
room, one wire connecting to twelve dry cells, and then to trans­
mitter, and the other wire from the circle direct to the trans­
mitter. This transmission gives the best effect if an ordinary
Kellogg transmitter is used. It is advisable to have a switch to
open and close the circuit, as twelve batteries connected to a
transmitter will soon burn it up, but with a switch the current
can be thrown off when not in use.
22 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q”
With this method the questions are exchanged by any one
of the aforementioned methods, taken to the dressing room,
opened by the confederate, and transmitted to the medium, who
can walk around the stage, and still be able to get his informa*
tion by induction, or wireless.
We know of a medium who had great success using induc­
tion, but in place of having his circle of wire under the rug, he
had it sewed to his back drop, and in place of having the small
coil in his turban, he had this on his back, and wires running to
receiver in turban from same.
Another medium, who has a small spiritualistic church, has
the floor coil running the entire way around, not only his stage,
but the audience as well, and obtains very good results. But in
so doing, in place of a Kellogg transmitter, he uses a 232 W.
transmitter, manufactured by the Western Electric Company.
This entire apparatus can be put up and in working order for
$15.00, by any person acquainted with wiring for electricity.
PUBLISHER’S NOTE: In considering the cost of manufacture of
this and various items in the book, one should realize that much higher
costs will prevail today than at the time the original manuscript was
written.
THE WHISPERING BUDDAH
This induction method was the same method that was used
by Dr. “Q” in presenting that baffling mystery, the Whispering
Buddah.
The Doctor had a Buddah carved of solid wood, twenty-six
inches high. This wooden image was then split in two and close
to the mouth of same was placed a transmitter connecting to a
coil of wire, a space for which
was carved out on the inside of
the Buddah at the back, and also
another coil in the bottom of the
Buddah. The reason for these
two coils was that in case a per­
son should turn the Buddah for­
ward on its back, or on its face,
the small coil would still receive
the vibration from the coil in the
floor, and the Buddah would still
continue to talk. After these
coils and the receiver had been
installed in the Buddah, it was
glued together again, finished
off in gold leaf, and highly lac­
quered, and set with many semi­
precious stones. It made a very
impressive object, and the Doc­
tor used to have it in his parlors where he gave private sittings,
and in another room was the transmission outfit consisting of
transmitter and batteries, exactly the same as is used in present­
ing the induction method upon the stage. But the Doctor also had
a detectaphone which ran into the room where his transmitter
and confederate were, so that the confederate could hear any­
thing that was mentioned in the office. The Doctor would give
an audible reading to his sitters, and when he was finished, he
would say, “It may be that I have not covered the ground clearly
for you. It may still be that you have some questions that have
remained unanswered, that it is impossible for me to answer, but
I have in my possession an idol, a Buddah that was stolen from
the temple of Iscaha in Delhi, and into this idol comes the spirits
of India’s great and learned philosophers who have passed to the
The Whispering Buddah
23
24 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q1
other side, and should you desire answers to your questions, you
have but to take Buddah into your lap, place your arm around it,
and your ear to its lips, and ask out loud your questions, and
Buddah will answer for you.” This the sitter would do, and as
they audibly asked their questions the confederate listening in
the other room on the detectaphone could readily hear them, and
he would immediately throw in the switch, speak into the trans­
mitter, same would be carried to the coil in the carpet, and
transmitted to the Buddah. _
This induction does away with the buzzing sound that is
heard in the ordinary telephone, and the effect with the Buddah
is absolutely uncanny, and has a wonderful effect upon anyone
who listens to it who is not in the know.
Dr. “Q” personally gave me the exact drawings and secret
for this wonderful Buddah. I had one made up by a magical
manufacturer, and they personally added several wonderful im­
provements to same, and I have used it in my own home for
magical purposes, and it is without a doubt one of the most
mysterious experiments ever presented to lovers of magic.
The Talking Vase, and Talking Teakettle, are worked on
exactly the same principle, but I know of a friend who, besides
using induction to have his teakettle talk, had a loud-talking
phone in the bottom of the chair that he sets the teakettle on.
This phone was connected by wires through the leg of the chair
to brads in the bottom back legs, which, with a little pressure,
will go through the carpet, connecting to two copper plates that
are connected by two wires to a transmitter in another room,
where the confederate talks over same. But neither the tea­
kettle, the vase, nor the talking violin, which is also operated by
the same method, in no way compare with the wonderful effect
obtained by the Whispering Buddah.
Questions can be written and exchanged, taken to the other
room, and answered by the confederate to those who hold the
Buddah.
There are a thousand little wonderful magical experiments
that can be presented with this idol, and the Buddah itself is a
work of art that is worthy of any person’s collection of antiques.
PUBLISHER'S NOTE: The new and modern version of the Induc­
tion Phone, Talking Teakettle and Talking Buddha employs an am­
plifying unit, thus giving continuous performance without- danger of
bunting up the instruments, better volume of speech and far greater
range. Actually, only in the last few years has this unique principle
been perfected to a professional standpoint
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q" 25
METAL BELL METHOD
Another method for getting the information to the medium
is being sold by a Chicago magical company for $200.00, and
consists of a metal ball, as per the accompanying illustration.
This metal ball has a wheel within it that revolves in front of a
slot, operated by a little cog wheel. The questions must be
abbreviated, and written on a piece of paper that covers the
inner wheel, which is an inch in width. The performer then
holds this ball in his left hand, presses upon the cog wheel and
the questions come into view. This is not a very satisfactory
method, as not over fifteen or sixteen questions can be written
on the ball, and as the ball can be taken apart a seam is very
plain in the center of it, unless the spotlight is kept directly
upon the performer at all times, to sort of blind the audience.
The same company also furnish a little hand fake, about three
and one-quarter inches in length, and about two inches in width.
This is built like a box, and is made of tin, upon which is rolled
a strip of paper, with the questions upon it. This is supposed
to be held in a handkerchief with a hole in it, and crystal on top
of that. The forward roller revolves with the tip of the fingers.
Both the ball and hand fake are very impractical; nevertheless,
we understand that there are several who have spent $200.00
for same. The entire apparatus can be manufactured for a cost
not to exceed $50.00.
But it seems that they had the nucleus of a good idea, as
there is another Chicago firm that sells a metal ball for the same
purpose that is made up very similar, and consists of a spun brass
ball, the same as is used in “The Cannon Ball from the Hat."
This is heavily nickeled, and two slots are cut two inches long,
and one thirty-second of an inch wide, parallel with each other
and one inch apart. The space between the two is then slightly
bent inward, and a long strip of paper six, eight, or ten feet long
can be filled with written questions, and shoved into the upper
slot of the ball, the end of it threading back down into the lower
slot The medium can then exhibit this ball, the palm of his
hand covering the paper that is exposed, and as he supposedly
wipes the metal ball off with a handkerchief he can shift this
strip of paper from out of the upper slot down into the lower
slot, thus giving him two or three questions in view, at all times.
But.there are many drawbacks to this as well, as the paper often
aatalfes and tears, and there is the danger of dropping the ball
on h ^ p o r, and a thousand other little things that can happen.
2G THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q”
This reader consists of a spun metal ball five inches in
diameter (figures 1, 2 and 3) of 20-gauge brass made in two sec­
tions. A ring (BBB, figures 1, 2 and 3) three-eighths of an inch
wide and of a size to fit inside of ball is soldered to one section,
allowing it to project about half its width so as to form a rabbet,
or ledge, for the other section of the ball to fit over. A small
opening three-eighths by one and one-half inches is cut in upper
section of ball at KK, figures 1 and 2, and three small pins (DDD,
figure 3) are soldered to inside of ball in such position that
three lugs or catches, having a slot in each (AAA, figures 1, 2
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q” 27
and 3—shown more clearly at C, figure 3) will engage pins when
two sections of ball are placed together and turned, slightly
locking sections together.
Wheel or drum (EEE, figures 1, 2 and 3), detail of which is
shown at figure 4, is made of sheet brass. Two sides are cut
four and three-eighths inches in diameter and a piece of brass
one and one-half inches wide is bent and soldered around these
to form a rim or face, bending down the ends as shown at BB,
figure 4, and soldering in a small piece (C, figure 4) to which a
small clip (D, figure 4), made of spring brass, will hook to hold
strip of paper in place. A small shaft (EE, figure 4) is run
through center of this drum and soldered in, and a cog (F, figure
4) is soldered on. Two plates of brass are cut to fit into ball
and bent at FFF, figures 1, 2 and 3, to form bearings for drum.
A slot is cut in each plate at GG, figures 2 and 3, for shaft of
drum. Two small spring steel wires bent as at J, figure 2, and
soldered to plates, press against shaft of drum, so drum will not
get out of place. Two cogs, the same size as the one soldered
to drum are fastened to one plate as shown at HHH, figures 1,
2 and 3, but so they will turn easily and placed so teeth will
engage as at figure 2. One cog projects through dot in side of
ball as at I, figure 2, so it can be turned by thumb to load. A
strip of paper the width of drum is stretched over rim of drum
and held at ends by spring clip (D, figure 4) which is hooked
over ends of paper and down to brass strip (C, figure 4). Drum
is placed in ball, and ball locked together. By turning cog which
projects through ball, writing on drum can be seen through
small opening (K, figures 1 and 2).
THE PEDESTAL METHOD, OR SPEAKER’S PROMPTER
This is perhaps one of the best methods ever used for gaining
the information from the audience, as the illustration on page 21
and description will show. On a beautiful pedestal, orientally
decorated, built on the same order as a piano lamp stand, about
four feet high, with a very thin top about nine inches in diam­
eter, sets a beautiful bronze skeleton crystal stand, on the top
of which rests the crystal. Table top can be thoroughly exam­
ined; crystal, either glass or metal, can be thoroughly examined,
as can also the skeleton stand upon which the crystal sets, as
the stand or ball are not tricked in any manner whatsoever. But
the table top is mechanical, and a touch of the fingers and up
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q”
behind the base springs a device upon which is rolled a long
paper ribbon, and upon this can be written from fifty to three
hundred questions. Four or five questions are in view at all
times, and a slight touch of the finger along a little belt arrange­
ment and four or five different questions are brought into view.
This is perhaps the most novel method of presenting this act
ever conceived of, and is the invention of a man who has spent
many years in presenting this sort of an act and investigating
along these lines. The device itself costs $125.00 to manufacture,
but gives the medium unlimited scope in answering questions,
as he at all times can choose from five or six in front of him.
By permission of the inventor, I am giving the complete
description of this act. I also understand that same is being
sold to mediums.
For a clear understanding, it would perhaps be best for me
to explain the entire act. Performer opens with a full stage and
gives a short lecture or discourse upon his work. The questions
are written at home, and in the audience. Same are gathered,
and exchanged by the bag or hand method, taken, to the dress­
ing room, one hundred and fifty of them written on a long strip
of paper, and inserted into the mechanism of the table top. The
pedestal is then brought on by an assistant, with an incense pot
burning on same. While this is going on another confederate in
the dressing room is opening the sealed envelopes, reading the
questions, and writing them with a stylus, such as is sold by
mimeograph people, on the upper edge of the envelopes, which
are re-sealed. Performer places crystal and base upon the
pedestal, assistant removing the incense pot, and crystal and
base are casually shown to the audience, as is also the table
top, which is very thin, and devoid of any suspicious construc­
tion. As soon as the crystal and base have been placed upon
the table top, a movement of the fingers brings five or six ques­
tions into view. The performer answers these, in his particular
style, and now and then memorizes two or three of them and
passes down into the audience, holding the hands of different
spectators, and returns to the stage, while answering five or six
questions. It is possible to stand six or eight feet away from
the pedestal, as there is plenty of space to write the questions
very large, so that they can be read ten or twelve feet away.
After answering those upon pedestal, the confederate who
has been writing upon the edge of the envelopes with a stylus
brings these sealed questions to the assistant upon the stage.
29
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q”
This assistant then palms them into the dummies as she takes
all the questions from the table; performer reaches for a hand­
ful of them, but takes the handful of envelopes that have the
information written on the outside. He can now step down into
the audience, holds these in front of him one at a time, and at
the right angle can read that which has been written with the
stylus. A movement or two of the thumb over this writing will
obliterate it, and he can hand the question back to the sitter.
This is very mysterious and it leads the audience to believe that
all questions can immediately be handed back that have never
left their sight. This is perhaps the strongest act along these
lines, that has ever been invented, and far superior to any of
the methods mentioned in this book.
This invention relates to speaker’s prompter, and particularly
pertains to a device for containing and operating an inscription­
receiving ribbon, which is especially adapted for use by speakers
and lecturers as an aid to memory while addressing an audience.
It is the object of this invention to provide a device of the
above character embodying reels upon which are wound an
inscription-bearing ribbon, which device is adapted upon rota­
tion of the reels to cause the ribbon to be moved so that the
notes thereon may be read by the speaker. This device is dis­
posed within a hollow base of a suitable stand or table on which
rests an ornamental object, so that its purpose is disguised and
not apparent to the ordinary observer.
Another object is to provide a simple and effective device
for advancing an inscription-receiving ribbon, together with a
construction whereby the device may be disposed within a hollow
portion of a suitable stand or table and be removably mounted
therein.
A further object is to provide means whereby the ribbon- *
advancing mechanism will be operated by a slight motion of
the speaker’s fingers.
Other objects will appear hereinafter.
The invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings,
in which:
• Figure 1 is a view in vertical section of a device made in
accordance with this invention, as seen on the line 1-1 of figure 2.
30 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q'
Figure 2 is a plane view of the device showing the cover
portion in a vertical position.
THE LITE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q” 31
More specifically, 5 indicates an inscription ribbon operating
mechanism which is adapted to be disposed within a hollow
portion (6) of a stand or table (7), as shown. This mechanism
is provided with two paralled frame members (8) to hold the
parts in position. Inscription reels 10 and 11 are rotatably
mounted between these frame members and are provided with
slots (12) to receive either end of an inscription-receiving rib­
bon, so that this ribbon may be wound from one reel upon the
other, thus passing across the line of vision of an observer so
that the notes may be read. A cover portion (13) of this mecha­
nism is pivotally mounted at one end of the frame and normally
reposes upon this frame so as to be flush with the surface of
the table and appear as part thereof. The upper surface of the
table is covered with suitable material (14), such as black velvet
and a similar piece (15) is glued to the cover (13), so that when
this cover is in its closed position the surface of the table appears
smooth and unbroken and the device is not apparent to the
ordinary observer.
The cover is provided with three guide rollers (16, 17, and
18), adapted to retain an inscription-receiving ribbon in position
between them and the adjacent surface of the cover portion
(13). The cover portion is provided with ears (34) which are
turned downward at right angles thereto and support trans­
verse bars (24) upon which rotate the guide rollers 16, 17, and
18 respectively. The pin supporting the guide roller 18 passes
through the supporting ears on either side and is rotatably
mounted in the frame members (8) and serves as a hinge for
the cover portion. A clip (30) is formed integral with the for­
ward end of the cover portion and is adapted to frictionally
engage a front wall (31) of the device. This front wall and the
corresponding position of the cover are arciform to conform with
the circular stand (7).
The reels 1 and 11 are provided with pulleys 32 and 32
formed integral therewith. A belt (22) of fabric or rubber is
placed around the pulleys to operatively connect them. This belt
is supported by two rotatable sleeves formed with shoulders
(21) to retain the belt in position therein, which sleeves are
supported by stationary shafts (19). The device is held in posi­
tion with the hollow portion of the stand by a spring (35) which
engages a transverse rod (36) fixed at either end to the frame
members.
I
32 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q”
When the device is placed in position below the surface of
the table a suitable ornameht is also placed thereon in such posi-
tion that the cover portion of the mechanism may be raised so
that the ribbon may be seen by the speaker, but not by other
observers; such an ornament is indicated by 23 and comprises
a standard (25) which supports an ornamental globe or sphere
(26). This standard is here shown as formed with two pieces
of sheet metal (27*27) in cruciform arrangement upon which is
fixed an object rest (28) having an accurate surface to retain
the sphere. Sockets not shown are disposed below the surface
of the table and alined with short dowels (29) which are formed
integral with the object support so that the support may be
readily placed in position over the ribbon-actuating mechanism
and remain fixed thereon.
In the operation of the device, the desired notes are inscribed
upon a ribbon in any suitable manner and that end of the rib­
bon which is to be read first is inserted in the slot of the for­
ward roller (10) and completely wound thereon; the other end
of the ribbon is then passed below the other red (11) and over
the rollers (16, 17, and 18) respectively provided in the cover
portion, and is then returned downward exteriorly to these three
rollers to the other roller (11) and -is secured thereto. This
arrangement causes the inscribed surface of the ribbon to be
visible to the speaker, and tile notes are read preferably as they
pass across the cover portion, which is raised to a vertical posi­
tion when the notes are to be read, but this cover is not visible
to the ordinary observer because of the standard (25).
When it is desired to read- the notes upon the feel the speaker
passes his thumb or finger fcictionally across that portion of the
belt resting upon the rotatable sleeves, thus causing the belt to
revolve the reel which in'tufn gradually rolls the ribbon from
the reel 10 to the reel 11, thufe successively bringing the notes in
the line of vision of the speaker.
Whereas I have shown a specific construction and arrange­
ment of parts to carry out my invention, I do not wish to be
confined thereto, but may employ such other constructions and
arrangement of parts as come within the scope of the appended
claims.
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q! 33
HAND BOX METHOD
Questions are switched by any of the aforementioned
methods, taken back stage where the assistant writes them upon
a slip of paper which runs on rollers, as per the illustration.
This box is painted with black and white paint and is attached
to the center of a black and white checked handkerchief so at
a distance of a few feet it is almost impossible to detect same.
The reason of the black and white checked handkerchief and
the box being painted in black and white check, is to black art
same so that it cannot be detected in the hand by those who are
sitting in the upper boxes. A slight movement of the right-hand
thumb turns the cog at the lower right-hand side of the box,
advancing the strip of paper ribbon on the rollers so that a new
question can be brought into view instantaneously. With care-
U'l observation you will notice that there is a little shield made
0‘ me.t'al on the top of this hand box; this is oval-shaped and
attached, to the box proper, and upon this rests the crystal.
34 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q”
ROLLER HAND FAKE SYSTEM
The accompanying illustration gives a method devised by a
medium in Kansas City. It consists, as the illustration explains,
of two rollers held by a metal framework, over which space is
a thin strip of paper. Same is worked by a little stud that can
be moved with the right hand, and this little fake is held in the
palm of the left hand, behind either the clear or metal crystal.
This apparatus is fairly good, if not over ten or twelve questions
are to be answered.
PUBLISHER’S NOTE: The illustration on the hand roller is mis­
leading. The question data is written across the strip of paper, rather
than reading lengthwise.
FARO BOX METHOD
The illustration on the next page explains fully the Faro
Box Method of reading questions. The questions are written
upon little cards, placed in this box, which closely 'resembles a
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q 35
faro box, and is concealed in the palm of the left hand, behind
the crystal, and a touch of the fingers shoves one of these cards
out of view, and another one into place. Fifty or sixty questions
can be answered by this method, and with two of these boxes
it is possible for the medium to give an entire evening’s enter­
tainment, which is, of course, varied by several other mental or
spiritual tests.
The questions are gathered and exchanged by any one of
the aforementioned methods, and are taken to the stage, where
two confederates, one on each side of the stage, close up to the
wings, have a large blackboard. The questions are written upon
the blackboard in a large hand so that the medium walking
from side to side can readily read the questions while apparently
gazing at the crystal, which he holds in his left hand.
STAGE ASTRAL TRANCE CLAIRVOYANCY
AS COMMUNICATED BY DR. “ q ”
The accompanying illustration will give a very clear ex­
planation of how this marvelous, supposedly mental test supreme
was for many years accomplished by the celebrated Doctor. This
act consists of three people, the medium, the manager, and a
small assistant, who is never seen by the audience; and a large
heavy screen, as per illustration. The screen is six feet four
inches in height, and each panel is forty-six inches in width.
Same are hinged together with invisible hinges. It is made of
a heavy wooden framework, two and one-half inches square, and
the outer panels are of dark colored designed silk, except the
rear panel, which is backed up with four-ply hardwood, and
in the center of same, twenty-four inches from the top, is a one-
inch circular opening—but this, of course, is covered by the silk.
On the back of the center panel is a shelf, wide enough to seat
the small assistant, leaving also room enough for a ten-inch
basket, which holds the questions.
The curtain rises upon a bare stage, with all the lights up.
The manager, or interlocutor of the act, comes forward in full
dress, and announces as follows:
36
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q” 37
“Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure this evening to
introduce one of the marvels of this century—a gentleman who
has spent years in the investigation of spiritual and occult
phenomena; a man who has devoted his entire life to delving
into the realm of mysticism that is so little understood and so
little believed by the average mind of today. Perhaps it would
not be out of place for me to state, as he will later prove to you,
that his mind is one hundred years in advance of any mind that
you have ever had the pleasure of hearing before. To go into
detail and tell you of all of the marvelous things that it is possible
for this man to accomplish, would occupy too much of your
time. But, to get down to the actual proof that it is possible
for him to accomplish the seemingly impossible, I will first of
all call your attention to a few hundred pieces of paper that I
will pass out among you, and I desire each one of you who is
given one of these pieces of paper to write your full name, and
two or three questions of importance concerning anything that
at the present time is dubious to you. You can write concern­
ing business, love, anything that you desire. It is not entirely
necessary that you write upon this paper that I furnish to you;
you may take paper from your pocket, a piece of program, or
anything that you desire. Write your name first, and your ques­
tions underneath. Fold them in any manner that you desire.”
Manager of act now passes down through the audience and
passes out slips of paper. As soon as he has done so, he returns
to the stage by the opposite aisle, and states: “As soon as you
have finished, fold them up, pin them together, fix them in any
manner that you desire. I will now pass down among you and
gather the entire lot of them.” This he does, with a large chang­
ing bag, such as manufactured by the magical supply houses,
and in the fake side of the changing bag he has three or four
hundred dummy questions, similar to those that he will shortly
gather. The questions from the audience are all gathered, and
he returns to the stage by the opposite aisle from which he has
gone down. He turns the handle of the changing bag, thus put­
ting the dummy questions in the top part of the sack, and the
questions written by the audience are now in the faked part of
the sack. He then dumps the phony questions on the table and
tosses the changing bag off the stage, and then says: “Ladies
and gentlemen, it is now my pleasure to introduce to you the
celebrated Dr. *Q’, the world’s master of mental mysticism, and
the only white graduate of that world-renowned Indian school.
Hatha Gnana.” Dr. “Q” enters, makes a slight bow to the
38 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q"
audience and seats himself in a plain wooden chair which the
manager has placed for him in the center of the stage. The
manager holds a small crystal in front of the Doctor’s eyes for
a few moments; the Doctor gazing mystically at it, seemingly
falls asleep. The manager then places a blindfold over his eyes,
and states: “Friends, the Doctor has now passed into that deep,
dead, astral trance. His body is here before you, his mind we
know not where, perhaps wandering into all parts of the world,
seeing that which to the average eye is invisible, hearing that
which to the average ear cannot be heard. To prove to you that
he cannot have communication from the outside, we will now
place a screen around him.” The manager and one stage hand
shove the screen out, which has small casters on the bottom of
same, making it look as if it was handled very lightly. But on
the back of the screen is the little assistant on the shelf, with
all of the questions that he has extracted from the changing
bag that the manager a few moments before tossed from the
stage. As soon as the screen has been placed around the Doctor,
as per the illustration, the little assistant opens the questions
one at a time, reads first of all the name on the question, and
then the question. The manager then picks up at random one
of the questions from the table, and immediately drops it back
again, and says in a monotonous, mysterious tone of voice:
"Doctor, look closely, get the influence that surrounds this party
who has written this question.” The Doctor then in a mysterious
voice speaks the name on the question that has just been com*
municated to him by his assistant on the back of the screen,
and in a roundabout way answers same, every now and then
interspersing his answers with bits of pathos and humor, and
also now and then a phony question. By that I mean a question
that has never been written by the audience, but one in which
he calls a number of names, etc.
The manager stands dose to the footlights, and as the names
are called requests the writers to acknowledge same by raising
their hands, and asking them, as the Doctor finishes answering
their questions, as to whether the Doctor is right or wrong. The
Doctor answers perhaps from one hundred to one hundred and
fifty questions very rapidly, and this makes it impossible for
those in the audience to follow when he answers a phony ques­
tion, and on account of seeing so many friends hands raised
for real questions, they are naturally led to believe that every
question is a legitimate one.
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q” 39
At the finish of the time allotted for the act, the manager
removes the blindfold from the Doctor’s eyes, and massages
his eyes and forehead for a few moments, snaps his fingers
several times, the Doctor awakes, bows, and leaves the stage,
and the manager announces: “There may perhaps have been
quite a number of you whose questions were not answered,
but you can all readily appreciate the terriffic mental strain
the Doctor has been under, and it not policy, as much as he
would like to, for me to allow him to spend but so much time
each day under this strain, as you can readily realize that the
physical results from such a terriffic mental strain might prove
disastrous and take from us, through death, this wonderful
master mind. I realize that perhaps some of you would not
care to have anyone see your questions, and for that reason
I will take them all to the front of the house, and as you are
passing out you may all get your questions and take them
home with you if you so desire. Those who do not avail them-
selves of the privilege, I assure you that within fifteen minutes
after this performance, I will personally take it upon myself
to burn them all, so that human eye will never see them.”
The manager then takes all the questions from the table
and passes down the aisle. The curtain drops, and the assistant
on the back of the screen immediately gathers up all of the
questions and rushes around to the front of the house and puts
them upon the table, in place of those that the manager has
carried down, so that when the unsuspecting public pass out,
there they find their questions that have supposedly been in
their sight all of the time.
This act is seemingly much more mysterious than either the •
silent or audible code act, or a wire or induction mental act.
The act is very cheaply constructed, as there are but two
things necessary, the screen, and the changing bag. And the
changing bag can be easily done away with by the manager
simply palming the questions of the audience as he passes around
the rear of the house, and substituting fake ones that he carries
in his pocket.

STAGE CLAIRVOYANCE
AS ORIGINALLY PRESENTED BY DR. “ Q” , THE MAXW ELLS, THE HOUSTONS,
AND M ANY OTHERS
The illustrations on pages 40 and 41 should make every­
thing very clear.
The performer introduces the lady, calling attention to
the fact that she was born with a marvelous and seemingly
supernatural power by which she is able to delve behind the
veil that conceals the future, also to look back among the
skeletons of the past, and to give wonderful advice on all ques­
tions of life. He also announces that he will pass down among
the audience, after the lady has been securely blindfolded, and
that any question that is whispered to him will be immediately
answered by the lady upon the stage.
He has concealed in his vest front a very sensitive receiver,
connected by two wires to a brad in the heel and one in the
sole of the shoe. The carpets that run down the aisle and up
the steps to the ground cloth have two-inch strips of copper
about three inches apart running the full length of same, and
where they meet the ground cloth on the stage these strips of
copper are connected by tinsel wires under the ground cloth
to the chair in which the medium sits. This chair is fitted up,
as per the diagram, with a sensitive receiver on the side of
same. A low-backed chair can be used, with a plug in the
back of same connecting with wires at the lady’s wrist-band that
run up to a receiver concealed in her hair, and from this re­
ceiver can run two rubber tubes to her ears, the same as were
used on the old-style phonograph. Now, any question that is
whispered to the operator in the audience is immediately trans­
mitted to the lady upon the stage, who can give a general round­
about answer to same, every now and then giving an answer
to a fake question where she can go into great detail giving
names, dates, etc. A book can be handed to the operator in
the audience, any verse pointed to, and as he slowly reads it
over in a whisper the lady upon the stage can repeat same.
This act is very mysterious, but it has its drawbacks, for
the reason that it is necessary to carry the long strips of carpet
42
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q” 43
with the copper strips in same, and people who are in the habit
of visiting the same theater are quick to notice the new carpet.
Dr. “Q” once told me of a terrible experience he had in
presenting this act that caused him to discard it entirely.
The following is his own story of this experience: “Proving
that the unexpected and impossible can often happen, I was
just announcing this wonderful act when a lady came in late
with a baby, carrying the baby’s bottle of milk. She had a
reserved seat in the first row, and as the usher raised up from
turning her seat down, he bumped into the lady and she dropped
the bottle of milk, which spilled on the runway causing a short
circuit in the wires. It is was impossible for me to continue with
the act as intended. Nevertheless, I was nonplussed only for the
moment, and did not make a fizzle of the act, because I im­
mediately resorted to the spoken code and no one but myself
and my lady assistant knew of the awful catastrophy that for
a few moments stared us in the face.”
PUBLISHER’S NOTE: The recently developed midget ear re­
ceivers, or bone conductor units are much superior to the author’s sug­
gested use of the rubber tubing. Extremely small in size, they can be
easily concealed. . . . The performer need not carry special carpets, as
suggested, but may wire regular house carpets in the theatre. With
modem theatre construction, concrete floors, this is some times a stu­
pendous task. The ultra modem application is the use of a midget radio
sending and receiving set, known as the 'Secret Invention’. This instru­
ment picks up the spectator’s voice in the audience, and transmits
it to the medium on the stage by radio. No installation is necessary,
as the units are worn under the clothing of the two performers.
CLAIRVOYANCY OF FIGURES
Are figures clairvoyants? This looks like it:
Put down the number of your living brothers; multiply by
two; add three; multiply the result by five. Now add the num­
ber of your living sisters. Multiply the total by ten.
Add the number of .your dead brdthers and sisters, sub­
tract 150 from the total.
The right-hand figure will be the number of deaths; the
middle figure will be the number of living sisters, and the left-
hand figure will be the number of living brothers.
44 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q'
TELEPATHY EXTRAORDINARY
The accompanying illustration is practically self-explana­
tory. The performer, on an openly lighted stage, announces that
it is possible for his lady assistant, who is actually blindfolded
and seated in the center of the stage, to see and describe any­
thing that he chances to have in his hands.
A committee is allowed to blindfold the lady, first placing
cotton over her eyes, then a kid glove, same being tied in
place with a handkerchief, proving positively and unquestion­
ably that the lady cannot see, and she is then seated in a
chair in the center of the stage. As the operator passes down
through the audience, different objects are handed to him and
they are instantly described by the lady.
The secret of this experiment is that there is an unknown
third party in the act, who stands behind a peek hole in the
wings with a high-powered pair of glasses, and sees every
object handed to the operator in the audience, and immediately
transmits the information via, detectaphone that is connected
with wires running under the stage to two copper plates under
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q” 45
the ground cloth, which connect with brads in the bottom oi
the rear chair legs to wires running through a sensitive re­
ceiver in the side of the chair (as per diagram), consequently
anything that is handed to the operator in the audience is im­
mediately seen by the assistant in the wings with the glasses,
and spoken into the detectaphone and the lady on the stage
can describe same, even to the smallest detail. This act is very
convincing as to the existence of telepathy.
THE MASTER MIND ACT
This act consists of a number of No. 2 drug envelopes, and
cards that fit snugly in same, and one envelope with the back
cut out holding a sponge, as per illustration in accompanying cut.
The method of operation of this act is practically the same as
the old act where a small tin box was used to contain a sponge
and odorless alcohol. The envelopes and cards are passed out
with the instructions for the sitters to write their name at the
top, and their questions underneath upon one side of the card,
place them in the envelope and seal them up. They are all col­
lected, and placed in the hand in which you have palmed the
envelope containing the sponge, which can be soaked in either
deodorized alcohol, or deodorized benzine. Envelopes are now
arranged in .a neat package in the hands, and the first one of the
envelopes that was collected, now rests against the sponge. A
slight pressure on the back of it brings the sponge in contact
with’ the envelope, moistening it, and rendering the envelope
transparent, so that the writing on the card is now perfectly
readable through the paper. This envelope is now withdrawn,
46 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q”
and placed upon the top of the packet toward the performer
so that he may read it. He now lowers his eyes for a moment,
as if in communication with the spiritual forces, and through
the partially closed lids reads the question, and so down through
the entire pile of collected questions.
This act, though possible, is very unsatisfactory, as it is too
slow and there is danger of the dupe placing the card wrong
side to in the envelope or insisting upon folding the cards on
placing them in the envelopes. Nevertheless, a certain magical
firm in the Far East widely advertised this act, and sold quite a
number of them at $5.00 each, for which the magician received
an envelope and sponge, three pages of multigraphed instruc­
tions, and fifty envelopes and cards. They also informed the
magician that tetrachloride has been found more satisfactory
than deodorized alcohol or benzine, as it spreads over a larger
surface and produces transparency quicker.
THE ZANC1G SECOND SIGHT ACT
This is the act presented by the Zancigs, Leona Lamar, The
Ellises, Madam Ellis, Mercedes, Prince Joedah Dah Radja, Lola
Cotton, and Harry and Emma Sharock, Ura Eno Nye, the Howard
Brothers, and many lesser lights. It is all a code—MIND READ­
ING. There’s no such animal. It’s psychic bunk as long as
audiences delight in being deluded.
The average person who is impressed by so-called mind read­
ing probably discredits the statement that these people work by
code or guesswork. He is inclined to point out instances where
the mind reader has answered correctly in proof of his belief.
Nevertheless, they are bunk, pure bunk. If two people will fol­
low the following Zancig code, which is easily memorized, they
will have no trouble in being as great a mind reader as the above
mentioned.
The act requires two or three people; the lady in the act is
generally the medium or the one that remains on the stage, blind­
folded if you desire, as that makes absolutely no difference. In
doing second sight you go entirely by figures from 1 to 0. Words
stand for these figures. For illustration:
The letter (I) stands for
(1);
The word (GO) for (2);
(CAN) for (3);
(SEE) for (4);
(AND) for (5);
(PLEASE) for (6);
(WILL) for (7);
(NOW) for (8);
(GIVE) for (9);
(TRY) for (0);
(NEXT) means repeat the
last figure.
Questions in an audience ordinarily are on the subject of
love, travel, marriage, business, or sickness. And the following
99 questions will practically cover any question that would be
asked in an audience. These questions and the number cor­
responding to the question must be memorized by all who work
the act. A few days and even the most sluggish mind can
memorize them, specially when you stop to think that the reward
is several hundred dollars a week, good clothes, and the privilege
of traveling all over the world where the English language is
spoken. And if you desire other countries, just brush up in the
language. They all love the “mystic bunk.”

Now, when you and your assistant on the stage have these
memorized, you can walk through the audience and allow any­
one to whisper a question in your ear, and the manner in which
you ask your assistant to answer the question tells here the ques­
tion. For illustration, the party asks “How many children will
I have?” You say to your assistant: “PLEASE you TRY to
answer this lady's question." Your assistant immediately says:
“Madam, I see you will be the mother of a large family of six
children” (or whatever answer she sees fit to give). The words
PLEASE and TRY in your speaking to your assistant were the
cue words, and PLEASE stands for 6, and TRY stands for 0, and
the question “HOW MANY CHILDREN WILL I HAVE?” is
number 60 in your list.
Now, if you desire to really startle the audience you whisper
to the lady and ask her how many children she really has and
you will see if the medium on the stage can tell her. The lady
whispers to you that she has two. So you speak to the medium
on the stage and say, ‘GO on, tell the numbers she already has.”
GO means No. 2 in your code of numbers, so your assistant says:
“Why, the lady has two children." And you have startled your
audience, because they know that the lady is a complete stranger
to you.
For illustration: A party asks you to have the medium tell
you if they should marry the light or dark one. You say to the
medium “AND I want you to answer this question NEXT.” AND
means 5, and NEXT means repeat the last number, consequently
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q' 51
you have told the medium 55, which is; “Shall I marry the dark
or the light one?” in your list.
Now, more than likely after reading the above act over, a
person who is uninitiated in magic will say, “Why I can ask
questions that are not contained in that list”—but if you will try
and write out fifty to one hundred questions and then compare
them with the list you will readily see that you have perhaps
asked questions that are not word for word the same as given
in the list, but that the gist of your questions will mean prac­
tically the same as the gist of the questions in the list.
There are two other things to be considered in a list of ques­
tions, and that is to be able to cue to the medium upon the stage
to say YES or NO. In case a person should ask a question of the
operator in the audience such as, “Will I be in Buenos Aires at
this time next year?" it would be policy for the operator to cue
No. 92, which is “Shall I take a journey,” and also cue to the
medium upon the stage the word “YES," which is cued by the
word “HURRY,” and the word “NO” is cued by the word
“MADAM.” In other words the cue to the medium upon the
stage could be given in the following sentence: “HURRY GIVE
the answer, GO on”—HURRY means to answer the question in
the affirmative, GIVE means No. 9 and GO means No. 2 and No.
92 means “Shall I take a journey”—and the medium would
naturally answer in a roundabout way such as, “I see it is only
a matter of time until a thought that you have in mind at the
present time proves a reality, and that will eventually bring
you success and happiness, and it is my advice for you to take
the journey that you have for some time contemplated, and by
so doing bring about a realization of the hopes and desires that
have for a long time been paramount in your mind.” Now an
answer of this kind in reality covers a great deal of ground, and
would make it almost an impossibility for the questioner to say
that you had not hit the question exactly on the head.
A little practice before the public and two week’s time, and
two people studying this particular line of mystery become very
efficient, and it becomes almost an impossibility, even for those
in the know, to fathom the code used, as naturally any act of
this kind will change its list around a great deal from time to
time.
With Leona Lamar, Madam Ellis, Princess Olga and Madam
Harris, and those presenting this act with the spoken code, about
52 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q"
every third question answered from the stage is a phony one. In
other words, there is no such party in the audience having asked
the question, and for that reason the medium upon the stage is
able to give names, dates, etc., making it very mysterious. For
illustration: After the medium has answered two questions that
have been cued to her (the operator always being on the move
in the audience it is hard for the audience to tell just exactly
who has asked the question) she will state, “I get the name of
Mary Jones—you want to know as to whether you are to marry
this coming year or not; the fact of the matter is that you have
two sweethearts at the present time, one of them named George
and the other Fred. Fred would be the proper one for you to
marry, as George has been married before and it was impossible
for him to get along with his wife, consequently there is no need
of your taking the chances of having to go through what his
poor first wife went through. You were bom on the 15th day
of June and George was bom on the 10th day of June, conse­
quently you were born in the same sign and two people who
were born in the same sign never get along together. Fred, as
you perhaps know, was born on the 8th day of November, which
is in the sign of Scorpio, and you will find out all through life
that you get along with Scorpio people best. So my advice is to
place all of your time and attention to Fred.” Now an answer
of this kind from the medium upon the stage naturally leads the
audience to believe that it was possible for you to call names,
and dates and even birth dates of people that you have never
seen before, and its effect upon an audience is something
marvelous.
Now all of the above relates to a double or spoken word
code, which has been used for many years by the leading lights
in the profession. But there is a far better code that can be and
is used by later day mental workers, such as the Huttons, the
Svengallies, who in place of answering questions only transmit
musical tests, and the Nelsons, who transmit only questions,
names, etc. The accompaning illustration will give a very clear
outline of their method. The medium upon the stage is blind­
folded with a supposedly heavy black cloth, but the cloth that is
directly over the eyes of the medium, in place of being the
heavy black cloth is thin black veiling, which allows the medium
upon the stage to at all times see the operator in the audience.
Should a question be asked of the operator such as “What busi­
ness will I best succeed?” the operator simply touches the right
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q1 53
side of his jaw with his left hand or touches his right forearm
with his left hand, which as you will see by the diagram both
mean No. 7, and No. 7 in the list means “What business will I
succeed in?” The medium upon the stage is able to see this and
immediately answers the question.
It is advisable to use the head and the
body code together, as in this manner they
all look like natural moves.
Now in cases of transmitting music,
they first of all have a list of grand opera,
then popular pieces, etc., memorized, and
as the names of the pieces are whispered
to the operator he immediately gives the
same silently by touching the body in
same manner as transmitting questions.
This same thing is done with lists of
names, states, cities, etc. This act can be
made very complex and practically im­
possible to fathom by using both the
spoken code and the silent head and body
code as well.
Now, upon first r e a d i n g these
methods, to the uninitiated it will seem
very complex; nevertheless it is very
simple when a little time and attention
are given to it. When you stop to figure
that in six months’ time the average stu­
dent becomes very proficient in shorthand,
and all of the code methods are learned
easily in one-half the time, and that the
remuneration for an act of this kind is at least ten times what a
shorthand operator can get, it should naturally lead a person
interested along mystery lines to give it their very best attention
and efforts to become expert and proficient in the work.
THE ANNA EVA FAY ACT
This act is perhaps one of the oldest methods in use at the
present day, and was supposedly the invention of Samri Bald­
win. This act requires from four to six people to be properly
presented. The lecturer announces the wonderful power of the
medium, and requests the audience to write their questions upon
tablets that are passed through the aisles by assistants, and then
to tear off their questions, and place the same in their pocket—
of course, requesting them to sign their names to their questions.
The assistants then gather up the tablets and the lecturer intro­
duces the medium, who takes a seat close to the footlights. A
sheet is thrown over her, and she commences calling the names
of different ones in the audience. As soon as they answer their
name, she proceeds to answer the questions, somewhat as fol­
lows: “Mrs. Anderson, I see that you are going to take a trip
to Seattle regarding money matters. It is my belief that the
move will be a very good one. I advise you to go, and all will
be well." After the writer has acknowledged that she is right,
she proceeds on to the next, and so on until all of the writers
are identified and their questions answered. And the audience
goes home marvelling. Of course, many believe that they have
witnessed the exercise of some great supernatural power. The
secret, however, is very simple, like that of all great tricks. The
tablets used are made up of four sheets of paper. The first two
sheets are divided into four sections. The questions are written,
one upon each section, and then torn off. The third sheet from
the top is the impression sheet, prepared by coating its under
surface with paraffin wax. The fourth sheet is for receiving the
waxed impression of the question, which has been written oh
the sheet above.
The assistants, having gathered the tablets, carry them back
stage, using care to keep the tablets from each side of the house
separate, and in rotation as they were when gathered up. This,
of course, is to enable the medium to state the writer’s position
in the house.
The questions, which have been transferred in wax to the
lower sheet, are perfectly invisible until they have been devel­
oped by dusting a powder composed of one part plumbago, and
54
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q” 55
two parts powdered charcoal, over them. The powder adhers to
the wax, and makes the writing visible.
As fast as three or four assistants can develop and read these
questions, they are communicated to the medium upon the stage,
either by the rubber hose route, or the telephone method. If a
sheet is used to cover the medium, the receiver may be hidden
anywhere on her person, but in case no sheet is used, the tele­
phone receiver can be concealed in the air over the ear, or in an
oriental headdress. The wires, of course, run beneath the clothes
to copper plates upon the sole of each shoe. To complete the
circuit, all that is necessary, is to place these plates over a couple
of nails on the stage connected to wires that run to the trans­
mitter in the dressing room.
INSTRUCTION FOR PREPARING THE WAXED
IM PRESSION PAPER
Take one cupful of melted paraffin wax, and add one table­
spoonful of cottonseed oil. Pour this into a mold and allow same
to become cold before attempting to use it. Now take ordinary
light book paper that has a thin glaze, and rub the cake of wax
over it until its surface becomes completely covered. The paper
should, of course, be placed on a very smooth surface in doing
this. Then brush all loose particles off with a piece of silk. Paper
thus prepared appears the same as any glazed paper, and the
casual observer will never notice anything wrong with it.
This same waxed pad method can be used very successfully
with the Talking Teakettle, the Whispering Buddah, or in fact,
any place where the medium desires to secretly know the writing
of the sitters or audience.
PUBLISHER’S NOTE: The unproved version of the Anna Faye
impression board is to rub the wax on the cardboard table or pad, and
attach three sheets of paper. The invisible wax impression is then
retained on the bottom side of the last sheet, and .Is developed by
sprinkling the developing powder on same. The writing will naturally
appear in reverse, and may be read by holding the paper against a
bright light, and reading thru it, or holding in front of a mirror, and
reading the writing in the mirror. These tablets have their draw back,
especially in hot weather, as the soft wax tends to smug the writing.
The more modern apparatus is the Ultra Clip Board, which em­
ploys only a single sheet or paper, registering a perfect copy of the
writing inside the board. These boards are masterfully made and will
ally any suspicion, and may be subjected to the most critical examina­
tion.
HUMOROUS QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
TO BE USED AS PHONIES IN CONNECTION W ITH THE CRYSTAL GAZING ACT,
THE ZANCIG ACT, SILENT OR AUDIBLE CODE ACT
John Smith—You desire to know as to whether you will be
able to make a sale of your automobile or not. You must be
joking with me, or trying to fool me, because I cannot see where
you have, or ever have had an automobile. Yes, yes, I see it
now—it is a Ford, and I see you getting rid of it very soon.
Mary Smith—You are wondering as to whether you will
ever be able to find your dog. I see your dog has just strength
enough to walk back out into the country where you purchased
him. You can get him if you go back out there, and if you will
feed him once in a while more than likely he will not run away,
because, at times, it is really essential to give even dogs a little
nourishment.
Jack Jones—You were dubious regarding me, and the ques­
tion you ask was as to how many cigars you have in your
pocket. That is a great deal easier than you think. You have
got four in your pocket; count them and see if I am not right.
And that is not all; you are.going to keep four in your pocket,
as you have never given away a cigar in your life.
Pete Slovack—You are wondering regarding buying a larger
house, and I would advise you to do so. You were also wonder­
ing as to whether you would ever have any children; the fact
is, you asked me that question, did you not? I don’t see you
having any children at all,—but I see your wife having three.
Mary Hutton—You were wondering as to whether you
were going to have happiness this summer. I see a little worry
surrounding you. You were also wondering, were you not, as
to how long your mother-in-law was going to visit you. The
vibration that I get is that she has come to stay from now on.
John Kelly—You were wondering, were you not, whether
the girl that you really love loves you. It is my belief that the
girl does love you John, even as much as you love her. Con­
fidently, I may tell you that she has been wondering why you
have not spoken and asked her to be your wife. Her oldest
56
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q" 57
brother has been trying to bet her ten dollars that you would
never get the nerve to propose. So take my advice, and tell
her next Sunday what is really on your mind.
Tom White—You were wondering, were you not, • as to
whether you would ever be able to marry Anna Raymond. Indi­
cations do not look very good. Is jt not a fact that her father
ordered you out of the house when you called last Sunday? I
thought so. My advice to you is to forget the girl, and not call
again, as you will more than likely take a trip to the land from
whence no man returneth if you do. and a word to the wise
should be sufficient, especially after the father has passed you
the word.
Kate Moore—It seems, Kate, that you have been having a
great deal of worry. It has been over the loss of a diamond
ring, and a wedding ring, was it not? These rings are neither
lost nor stolen; your husband found them in the bathroom for
about the fifteenth time, and he put them in the little watch
pocket of his trousers, and has them there. He did this simply
to try to cure you of leaving things around, as is your habit.
But if you want to play a real good joke on him, when he goes
to bed tonight you can take the rings, and then he will think
that he has lost them. Later on you can show up with the rings,
after he has gone through the same amount of worry, or a little
more, than you have.
Fred Allen—You were wondering, Fred, as to whether your
money was lost or stolen. It was neither lost or stolen. You
had given your wife no money and'she took the $3.00 from your
pocket that you have been worrying about, to pay the gas bill
before it was shut off.
Jack Nelson—You are wondering as to whether the girl you
gave the diamond ring to will ever return same. It is my belief
that she will not, because I feel that she has seven or eight other
rings which she got in the same manner that she acquired yours.
If I were in your place, I would simply forget the matter of the
ring, and the girl as well.
. Ike Wiesenbaum—You were wondering if you would be suc­
cessful with the system that you have for beating the races. My
advice for you is to forget the system completely, as there has
never been a system invented that will beat a gambling game,
and it is my belief that if you continue with your system, you
58 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q*’
will wake up some fine morning and the system will be all that
you will have.
Tom Look—You have been wondering a great deal Tom,
as to whether your wife, who is away on a visit, is really stop­
ping with her folks, as she .writes you she is. It is my belief
that she is, and that she is not going out with any other man,
but my advice for you is to cover up a lot of tracks that you
have been making while she was away, and have them covered
up before she gets back.
Tessie Corn—You were wondering, lady, were you not, as
to whether your husband will have success in the business that
he is in at the present time. It is my belief that you will be
short one husband before another three weeks are over if you
do not get him to get rid of the still that you have in your cellar
at the present time. No man ever was successful in evading the
law.
Ophelia Nice—You have been worrying considerably of late
regarding a neckpiece, wondering whether it was lost or stolen.
It is neither lost nor stolen. I get a vision of your having left it
in an automobile last Saturday evening when you were out with
a friend of yours, and after your little argument with him in
the car over his trying to embrace you, you were so upset that
you left your fur in your hurry to get out. If you will call him
up I am more than sure you will be able to obtain the fur that
you have considered gone forever.
Tom Adams—You were wondering as to whether your wife
was absolutely true to you. It is my belief that you can place
implicit confidence in her, up to the present time. But I would
suggest that you go home two hours earlier next Friday evening,
and knock at the front door, and then quickly run around to
the rear. Understand, that is simply a suggestion.
Madge Hart—You were wondering, and in fact you have had
considerable worry of late regarding your husband’s actions;
wondering why he had turned so cool towards you. The fault,
I assure you, is all yourself, as he received three of the letters
that you have been wondering why you did not get from your
gentleman friend in Kansas City. You also left the last page
of one of the letters that you sent to your friend in the writing
desk, in your hurry to mail same, and I do not believe that you
should worry, because the papers that you are deserving of will
be served on you in a few days.
DR. “Q’s” MYSTERIOUS WANT AD TEST
A SEEMINGLY POSITIVE PROOF OF CLAIRVOYANCY FOR
ANY MAGICAL OR MIND-READING ENTERTAINMENT
This test you will find, if you will pay strict attention to
directions, to be one of the strongest tests of your repertoire,
and it is absolutely impossible of detection if you will place a
little practice to it.
First, buy thirteen newspapers of the same date. Now cut
out of one paper one want ad, such as 'Tor Sale—Ford, $400.00,
phone Main 4.” Now from twelve of the papers cut out of each
one an ad, such as “Young lady wants position, $60.00 per month,
address Box 9”; and also cut out of each one another ad, such as
“For Sale—one set twin beds, call morning, No. 7 Main St.”
Now take twenty-five No. 2 drug envelopes, fold up the “Ford”
ad and place same in one of the envelopes, crimp the corner of
it and place it in the right-hand trouser pocket. Now take the
twelve “Young lady wants position” ads and place each one in
an envelope and seal. Place these in the right-hand vest pocket.
Now take the twelve “Twin bed” ads, place each one in an
envelope and seal, and place these in the left-hand trouser pocket.
Be sure to remember carefully where they are located. Have your
assistant, who is to act as the medium upon the stage, memorize
the three ads in rotation, not necessarily word for word, but the
gist of same. Now you are all loaded, ready to start to work. You
take the other newspaper and a pair of shears and thirteen empty
No. 2 drug envelopes. Call the attention of the audience to the
fact that you will now present an act proving beyond a doubt
that it is possible for your medium to give a positive proof of
clairvoyancy or etherial sight. Say:
“Friends, I have here a newspaper. I propose to allow you
to select any one of the want ad pages,” (which you do; always
suggest their selecting one where there will be reading matter
on the opposite side so there will be no confusion as to which
side of the paper should be read). They select a page, and you
now say, “I will cut all of these want ads separately, and I would
like to have a half dozen of you folks fold them up as I cut them
and place them in a tray.” After you have cut out about a
hundred, say, “I have here thirteen envelopes, and I would like
59
60 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q”
to have you pick out, without even looking at them, thirteen of
these folded ads. Place each one separately in an envelope and
seal it, without my touching the ad or assisting in the sealing,”
(You allow them to do this.) After they have them all sealed
you reach for the thirteen envelopes with your left hand and
hand them to someone, requesting them to shuffle them thor­
oughly so that it will be an impossibility for them or any human
being to know where any particular one is located. As they are
shuffling them you nonchalantly reach with your right hand
into your pocket and palm the envelope containing the “Ford”
ad, and as they return the thirteen envelopes to you, you palm
the envelope containing the “Ford” ad to the top of the pack.
You now hold the pack towards some lady and say, “Take one
of the envelopes,” at the same time shoving her the top envelope
which you have just palmed out. You now say, “I am going to
see if it is possible for the medium upon the stage to tell what
is in the envelope.” The assistant upon the stage then looks
mysterious and slowly repeats the "Ford” ad that she has memo­
rized. You during this time are holding the rest of the envelopes
in your right hand. Fold your arms and cautiously drop the
thirteen envelopes into your left-hand vest pocket, and obtain
with the left hand the twelve you have previously secreted in
your right-hand vest pocket. When the medium has finished re­
peating the first ad, you will say, “Friends, it might be possible
that some of you believe that I could have known, through hav­
ing touched the envelopes, what the ad was, but to do away with
this idea I would like to have someone take these twelve en­
velopes (the ones you now hold in your hand), shuffle them up
and place them in a hat and go back through the audience and
allow one of them to be selected, and the medium upon the
stage will read the one that is selected.” You allow this to be
done, and as soon as one has been taken out of the hat you re­
quest the return of the hat and hold the balance of the envelopes
in your left hand. The medium upon the stage now repeats the
“Young lady wants position” ad, doing so very slowly. Naturally
all attention is directed towards her, and while such is the case
you slip your left hand containing the envelopes into your left-
hand trouser pocket and exchange this packet for the packet con­
taining the “Twin bed” ad. When she has finished reading the
ad, you say, “We will try the experiment once more.” And once
more you allow the packet you now have in your hand to be
shuffled and one selected without your touching them. You get
the envelopes back as soon as one has been selected, casually
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q” 61
drop same into your right-hand vest pocket while the arms are
folded and obtain with the right hand all but three of the original
envelopes in which they first placed the ads, from your left-
hand vest pocket. You have now finished the experiment, stating
that you could go on and have her read all of them, but the
strain is too great. You can now toss the envelopes out among
them and some wise bird will perhaps more than likely open
them up and examine same, and he will find that each ad is
entirely different.
Do not be afraid of this as you can make up your mind that
all attention is distracted from you by the medium reading the
ad upon the stage, and in the more hesitating a manner she does
this the greater will be the distraction from you and the more
mysterious to the audience.
Upon reading this over, it will naturally seem complicated,
but if you will practice it over two or three times you will find
that you have without a doubt one of the greatest mysteries
ever presented.
CLAIRVOYANCY AND SLATE WRITING
EXTRAORDINARY
AS COMMUNICATED BY DR. “ q ” .
This seemingly supernatural experiment has perhaps mysti­
fied more people who have gone lor private sittings than any
other.
EFFECT
The dupe visits the medium and upon being ushered into his
inner office sees only two chairs and-a bare table upon which
are nine nine-by-seven-inch slates and one large twelve-by-nine-
inch slate. The dupe is requested to take a seat on the opposite
side of the table from the medium, is handed one of the small
slates and told to write at the top of the slate his full name and
occupation, and underneath that the five most important ques­
tions he wishes to know about. He is then requested to place
the slate, with the writing downward, on the top of the stack
of slates. The medium then places the large slate upon top of
the stack and requests the dupe to write upon it the initials of
someone in the spirit world. The medium then lifts the top slate
from the pile, holding the initials toward the dupe, and requests
him to gaze intently at the initials for two or three moments,
and then places same back upon the stack of slates. The medium
now grasps the hands of the dupe, tells him his name and occu­
pation and answers in a roundabout way all of his questions.
This is a seemingly miraculous feat, as it is impossible for the
medium to see through the slates, and to all appearances he has
at no time touched the slate upon which the dupe has written.
There are many variations of this experiment that would seem­
ingly convince the most skeptical. <
EXPLANATION
The explanation of the above is very simple. The medium
did not know the dupe when he entered his office, in fact knew
nothing at all about him. He required no peekholes in the wall
to see what the sitter was writing nor any outside assistance of
any kind. When the dupe enters the room the medium says:
"Friend, I see grave doubt surrounding you; many peculiar
changes are about to take place in your life during the coming
0 62
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. *'Q' 63
twelve months, some of them that I would perhaps consider
of great importance you may perhaps consider of little im­
portance, but it is my belief that I can assist you and keep you
from falling into the pitfalls and over the stumbling blocks that
will naturally deter you in your progress through life. Doubt,
as you perhaps know, is man’s greatest enemy, and the mere
fact of your coming to see me proves to me absolutely and con­
clusively that many doubts are existing in your mind at the
p e~ent.time. Be seated and we will go into the matter deeply
a d see?"if it is not possible to clear up these things that to you
a he present time are an intricate mystery.” The dupe is seated
y*. •
64 THE LITE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q"
upon one side of the table and the medium upon the other. The
medium gives the dupe a Slate pencil and one of the small slates
from the top of the stack and says to him: "Friend when you
entered this room there were perhaps a thousand doubts of your­
self and life in your mind about which you felt you wished to
be enlightened. To go into all of these little details would per­
haps require a week of my time and yours, but let us immedi­
ately get to the grave and important ones that you have in mind.
You have in your hand a slate and a pencil; at the top-of the
slate I desire you to write your full name and occupation, and
underneath that write what you in your mind consider the four
or five most important'questions that are disturbing your mental
poise at the present time. In case you want to know regarding
any particular, business, state the same plainly in your question,
or in case you wish to know regarding any particular person,
place their name plainly in your question, or in fact anything
that worries you. Do not tell me your name, do not tell me your
occupation, do not even through one word or suggestion tell me
any of your questions. As soon as you have written them place
the slate downward upon this stack of slates.” The dupe writes:
John Henry Smith — Occupation, storekeeper, gent’s
furnishings.
1. Will I be able to meet the note at the bank when due?
2. Will I sell the two lots that I have in the Howard addi­
tion?
3. Does Mary Coleman care for me as much as I care for
her? Will she marry me?
4. Is there a death among any of my relatives in the near
future?
These questions having been written, the slate on which they
are written is placed upon the stack of slates. The dupe has
given no information whatever to the medium regarding what
he has written. Now the medium places the large slate upon
the stack and requests the dupe to write the initials of some one
who has passed into the spirit life. The medium now picks up
the large slate and holds the initialed‘side towards the dupe.
However, in removing the large slate he has also with his thumb
removed the slate upon which the dupe has written his questions
as well. He then holds the large slate up in front of the dupe
for a couple of minutes or so and tells him to gaze upon the
initials and concentrate. The medium has but to look at the
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q" 65
dupe’s slate, which he is holding against the large one, and read
his name, occupation and his questions. After the dupe has con-
centrated upon the initials long enough for the medium to read
the questions, the medium replaces the large slate back upon
the stack of slates, which of course carries the dupe’s slate with
it. He then shoves the slate to one side, grasps the sitter’s hands
tightly for effect, closes his eyes, shivers and grunts a few
times, and says: “Friend, I get a very upset condition surround­
ing you. Your mind is greatly troubled and the real reason that
you are not getting the great things out of life that you should
get, is because you are allowing doubt to enter your mind. First
of all I get a spirit vibration from one of your family who has
gone on before, that all is well, not only with him, but with all
of your relatives who have passed into the great beyond. They
desire me to tell you that another one of your relatives, just
whom they do not say, but one you have had a little worry over,
will soon be taken from this material life into the happiness
and grandeur of spirit life, and that you should not in any way
worry over this as it is the great adventure through which we
all must pass in the working put of our betterment. They also
tell me that you will be benefited in a financial way through the
passing out of this relative, and I also get a vibration from the
other side that the following year will be a wonderful one for
you in business and that the worry you have at the present time
over financial affairs and over a paper that is held by the bank
with the signature “John Henry Smith,” should not be worried
over, as the bank will extend this paper, if it is necessary, and
all will be well. Regarding two lots that you hold, I get a mental
picture of the addition in the outskirts of the city, soon to be all
built up with houses.- These two lots you should not sell as they
will greatly enhance in value. Later a sale of same will be made
by you and other lots purchased in a better district, and I get
a vision of a beautiful home, and in this home I get the vision
of yourself, two children and a woman whom you call ‘Mary.’
I see her relatives coming to visit you, and their name comes to
me as Coleman, so the worries that exist around you at the
present time are only doubts, and by banishing all of these
doubts from your mind, this vision that I see should come true.
There are many times that doubts will come to you in the future,
and when they do, your friends on the other side in spirit life
tell me to tell you to be of good cheer, and come and consult
them through me, and they will advise you as to your best in­
terests so that you may have the great happiness out of this
66 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q"
material life that they desire you to have. My fee is always
nominal. They also tell me that you have other friends surround­
ing you who are worried and upset, and that these friends will
consider you a better friend if you will, tell them to come and
see me and allow me to pierce that great veil that hides from
them the future. You need have no further worry, because I
get a vision of a building, a store, and see many people entering
this store and coming out in different raiment and with boxes
and bundles under their arms, and that your business will in­
crease so that you will give employment to more clerks, and
your bank account will also increase.”
The fee may be from $2.00 to $10.00 and the dupe is sent
away happy and satisfied. Perhaps to a great extent the reading
has benefited him; nevertheless he has been duped and he has
been tricked, and people could tell him this from now until
doomsday, and he would perhaps never be convinced of it, be­
cause the medium did not answer his questions directly word
for word or question for question (that would smack too much
of trickery), but he has gone at it in a roundabout way, and in
place of seeing disaster for him,, he has seen the good things in
life that are always pleasing to all. You will note that he has
also advised the dupe to send in his friends, and has also advised
him to again consult him, which he invariably will do, and in
the meantime the medium, of course having his name and occu­
pation, can look him up in the directory, find out the names
of all of the relatives in his immediate family, his phone number
and address, and perhaps through his friends, who call to see
him, gain a great deal of information regarding him. More than
likely Mary Coleman will call to see him, and the medium will
advise her to marry John Henry Smith, and his advice to her
will be just as impressive as the advice which he gave John
Henry. As the medium remains in the city he continues to
gather information of this kind, and at the next sitting or at a
previous sitting with John Henry, he will more than likely sug­
gest that he get slate writing for him, for which he will perhaps
charge from $5.00 to $50.00.
In getting the slate writing he makes use of no further ap­
paratus other than the same stack of small slates and the big
one, and he handles it in this manner: John Smith enters the
waiting room, more than likely by appointment, and the medium
is told of this by his office girl or assistant. He immediately
takes one of the small slates and writes upon it a message similar
to this:
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q” 67
My Dear John:
It is a wonderful pleasure for me to be able to communicate
with you through the assistance of this wonderful medium. We
are near you, see and hear you at all times, and do our very
best to assist you in your daily work and life, so be of good cheer
and remember that the grave does not end all. The material body
in which you are living is simply a house within which your
great spirit lives, and earthly “death” as it is called, should hold
no fear for you. There are many great things for you to accom­
plish in life, much happiness for you to enjoy, and all of the
things that cause you worry and unhappiness, doubt and dis­
comfort, through the aid of your wonderful medium, we are go­
ing to assist you to overcome, so that before you pass from your
earthly existence your name will be one among men. While you
are living in your material life you should pay more attention
to your spiritual development. This your medium will show you
how to do, if you will but place absolute confidence in him. Re­
member that the servant is worthy of his hire, that he must exist
and have the wherewith to exist in the material life, and any­
thing that you may give him will be returned to you both in the
material life and spiritual life tenfold. We would like to com­
municate with you often; bring your greatest problems to us
and we will solve them for you so that your path in the ma­
terial existence upon earth may be much easier and filled with
happiness.
Your loving sister Grace.
Now this slate is placed upon the top of the stack of slates
on the table, under the large slate, and as the dupe is announced,
he is requested to be seated, and the medium picks up the large
slate, carrying the small slate containing the message with it.
The dupe is handed a damp sponge and requested to thoroughly
clean all of the small slates and hold them between his hands
to magnetize same, and then stack them up on the center of the
table. The medium then gives a short discourse upon spiritual
life in general, asks John Henry if he has not been feeling better,
and feeling the conditions have been better around him since
his last visit. (The medium of course-has gained, through out­
side information and other customers, the fact that John Henry
has a sister named Grace in the spirit life.) He now places the
big slate upon the stack of slates, leaving of course the slate with
the message on, which has been concealed on the bottom of the
big slate, on top of the stack as well. The medium then requests
the dupe to write the names of five or six people who have passed
into the spirit world, upon the large slate (he requests the dupe
to dean the &ig slate also before writing the names upon it).
After the dupe has written the names upon the large slate the
68 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q"
medium takes the slate, asks the dupe to hold his wrists and
passes the pencil over all of the different names. It is almost
a certainty that if John has had a sister pass out that he will
have written her name in the list, and when the pencil is passed
over her name the medium draws a line through it and says:
“I get the strongest vibration and influence from this one—the
fact of the matter is I feel her presence around you at the present
time and she tells me that she is a sister of yours and that she
wants to write a message on one of these slates for you.” The
medium then breaks the point off of the slate pencil, raises the
top small slate from the stack a little, being careful not to dis­
close the message, and drops the piece of slate pencil between
the top slate and the next one. He then lifts the two top slates
off with both hands, and requests John Henry to tie the two
slates together with a handkerchief. He then holds the slates in
the air requesting John Henry to place his hands over the top
of same with his thumbs on the bottom. The medium does the
same, requesting John Henry to concentrate all of his thoughts
upon the fact that his sister Grace will write a message for him
upon the slate. And as they are concentrating the medium with
his. right or left thumb nail scratches the bottom of the date
and in a stage whisper says, “I feel the vibration; I can hear
her writing, can you?” Naturally John Henry hears the writing
also. After five or ten minutes of intense concentration, the
medium lets go of the slates and requests John Henry to untie
the handkerchief, saying he feels the message is complete. John
on opening the slate finds the message the medium has previously
written, which of course is seemingly^ positive proof that the
medium is possessed of supernatural power and that there is
nothing that he cannot do. The message is also written in such
a way as to give John Henry complete confidence in the medium.
There are a thousand different variations of messages according
to the information gained by the medium beforehand, and more
than likely John Henry, will consult the medium from once to
twice a week, paying each time a very substantial fee for being
duped.
There are many methods of obtaining slate writing upon
slates that are not tricked or without the use of the silicate or
slate flap. The illustration on page 69 shows one that has been
very successfully used by different fraudulent mediums, but this
requires a double room, portieres and an assistant, as you can
easily grasp from the illustration. After the ordinary dupes have
consulted the medium for a few times, they as a rule have im­
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q” 69
plicit confidence in him and do not look for trickery of any kind.
The accompanying illustration shows how it is possible to allow
the dupes to bring their own slates, and how the assistant in the
other room has but to write up a message on a duplicate set and
pass them to the medium just a second before he requests the
dupe to hold them tightly on the top of her head. It is very easy
to obtain duplicate slates because as a rule there are only four
or five different kinds and sizes of slates in a city.
Another variation that is seemingly positive proof to the
dupe, is to have lying upon the table a bible. The dupe is re­
quested to place his finger any place between the leaves of the
bible and hold it there, and to hold the slates with his other hand,
in conjunction with the medium, and the medium tells him that
he will not only get a message from the departed, but will also
have written the firs: verse on the page of the bible where he
has placed his finger. This is accomplished by having a bible
with all pages the same. These bibles can be secured from prac­
tically any magical supply house.
Editor’s Note:—The above was communicated to me by Dr.
“Q”. Nevertheless, the mere fact of slate writing being presented
by trickery does not at all convince me, nor did it convince Dr
“Q”, that genuine slate writing is not possible, because he also
communicated several experiences to me that he has never been
able to explain by trickery. The following are some of the ex­
periences in his own words:
70 • THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q”
"In 1891 I was in the city of Louisville, Ky. I had never
been there before in my entire life, and it was necessary for
me to remain their several days on account of a washout on the
railway line between there and Nashville. I went to a hotel and
registered under one of my professional aliases. When 1 was
sitting in the lobby after dinner I got into a conversation with
an elderly gentleman, and during the course of our conversation
he told me that he was going to a seance that evening which a
poor, unassuming, uneducated, elderly woman was holding at
her home in the outskirts of the city. He told me wonderful
tales of what she had been able to accomplish for him and he
mentioned that he always took his own slates. He also invited
me to accompany him. I considered it a pleasing way to spend
the evening, so I stepped out with him to a stationery store and
purchased ia, new pair of slates the same as he had. I excused
myself for a moment, upon returning to the hotel, went to my
room and with a penknife carved my initials in the slates, sent
a bellboy out for some wire, wired the slates together and
soldered the knots in the wire with some special solder that I
happened to have in my grip, then rewrapped the package and
accompanied my friend to the seance. There were eighteen
elderly people present, and the medium herself, who was per­
haps seventy years of age. She demanded no fee, but informed
us that we could leave any amount we wished upon the center
table when leaving. The room was practically bare except for
a table in the center. She then requested all of us to place our
slates upon the table. She turned the only lamp in the room
down; nevertheless there was enough light so that we could
readily distinguish the forms of everyone in the room. We were
then requested to all move close up to the table and place our
hands upon same. I placed my hand upon the edge of my own
slates, which had never left my sight for even a second. A few
hymns were sung, the poor old lady leading in a cracked voice,
and after about an hour sitting thus, she turned the lights up
and we were bid good evening. I noticed that several opened
their slates prior to leaving, and upon the same were written
messages. I considered it a very clever trick, one that I was un­
able to fathom, because I had not seen her leave the room for
a second. There were no portieres in the room, but it might have
been possible, as she passed the table several times, to exchange
some of the slates, as she wore a shawl and a very full skirt. I
on same, and I did not care about belittling a woman who I con-
did not open my slates as I felt positive there was no message
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q” 71
sidered was playing the same game that I was, so I took my
slates unopened to the hotel, went to my room and examined
them. The wire was still soldered and unmolested, the initials
were still engraved upon the slates, and written upon same was
a very indistinct message addressed to me in my real name and
signed by a brother of mine whom I had seen ten days before
in the best of health, in Chicago. I considered this very peculiar,
so much so that I immediately wired my brother in Chicago as
to whether any one had consulted him regarding my where­
abouts, which even he did not know, and I received in return a
wire from his wife stating that he had passed away five days
before in an elevator accident in a building on State street. I
several times afterwards, during my five-days’ stay in Louisville,
visited this medium and placed tests before her, but was never
at any time able to catch her in trickery or any suspicious move,
and considering the fact that no one ever left over $5.00 with
-her, it would not have been financially possible for her to have
gotten the information concerning me that was written upon
the slates.
“Another experience, of which I have had many, that leads
me to believe that all slate writing might not be trickery, was
in 1896 when I was in Sidney, Australia. I had just gotten off of
the boat from Cape Town, and had never before been in Sidney,
and was driven to quarters in a boarding house which had been
recommended to me by the cab driver who took me from the
boat. I again registered under one of my professional aliases,
and no one knew my real business, as I had told the landlady
that I was going into the back country for an English'mining
firm. There was a medium living at the boarding house who
held seances and gave slate writings, and one of the messages
that she got for me had my correct-name upon same and was
signed by my father, who had passed away when I was but three
years old. The message described in detail a hunt that I had had
and on which I narrowly escaped death, when lost from my
hunting party a hundred miles inland from Delego Bay, West
Africa. No living human being knew of this experience, as I
was alone at the time lost from my party, and I had never told
it to anyone on account of my own foolishness in the matter. It
is not for me to say whether it was genuine, or whether it was
clever trickery that was far beyond me, nevertheless I spent
many months in trying to fathom same, but was unable to prove
trickery in any way whatever."
72 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q”
SEALED MESSAGE AND SEALED SLATE TESTS
AS COMMUNICATED BY DR. “q ”
Paraphernalia used: An envelope, sheet of paper, two school
slates, with holes bored in the corners, and four bolts just long
enough to pass through the holes and hold a nut, and a cabinet.
Skeptics as a rule, in slate tests, always like something that
looks very difficult. The Doctor loves those with this idea in
mind. He first asks them to examine the cabinet, then bind him
to the chair (the same as Professor Ely in his trumpet seance).
After he is securely bound he will then request the dupes to
take the paper, write their name at the top, and the name of a
person who has passed into the spirit world, then four or five
questions, place same in the envelope and seal same up, clean ’
the slates thoroughly and then place the envelope between the
slates, pass the bolts through the corner of the slates, attach the
nuts and secure them down, and then put sealing wax on the
nuts and their private seal upon same, place the slates in his
lap and close the cabinet. He then requests them to sing a
couple of humns and after they finish to open the cabinet. Upon
opening the cabinet they find the slates unmolested. They are
requested to remove same and open them up. The envelope con­
taining their questions is still sealed, and a message is written
upon the slates giving names, etc. Everything can be thoroughly
examined; the slates are fastened together, the professor’s hands
are still tied, and no trickery can be detected.
The secret is this: The moment the cabinet is closed the
professor is able to remove his hands from the knots (as ex­
plained elsewhere). He then removes two false nails from the
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q' 73
binding around the slates, shoves same a little forward and
pulls out one of the slates from the framework, thus, of course,
giving him access to the envelope. He shoves a piece of orange
wood stick under the flap of the envelope, rolls it around and
opens the envelope, pulls the paper out, reads the question, etc.,
places same back in the envelope, applies a quick-drying glue
and reseals same. He then answers the questions by writing a
message on the inside of the slates, places the envelope back in,
replaces the binding and the two false nails that had been re­
moved, and puts his hands back into the knots on the chair. By
this time the hymns are over and he is ready for inspection.
This is one of the most convincing tests of slate writing that
it is possible to place before skeptics. I have had several pair
of these slates made up by a cabinet maker, also using the orig­
inal pair given me by Dr. “Q”, and I consider it one of the most
wonderful magic tricks for home or club entertainment, because
there is not even a surmise of its modus operandi that can reach
the mind of the greatest skeptic.
AUTOMATIC WRITING
Automatic writing has been very popular for many years
with a certain class of spiritualistic fakirs, and is presented at
private seances by many fake mediums. However, 1 have in my
travels run across hundreds of people who I honestly feel think
their hand is controlled by the spirits when they write, and 1
feel sure in saying that some of them really are endowed with
some peculiar power that has been impossible for me to fathom,
but in this article we will deal only with the celebrated Professor
Ely, a very impressive sort of a man who stays but a short time
in each city, generally renting a hall for three nights a week for
a month or two; he heralds the city very strongly, gets in touch
with all of the local mediums and gets their dope books. As you
enter the hall to his meetings there is a table at the doorway
upon which are pencils and slips of paper. You are requested
to write upon the paper, first the name of some one who has
passed into the spirit world, then your own name in full and
two or three questions that you desire to ask of your departed
friend or relative. In case you did not write at the door, you are
given a slip when in the audience and you have the privilege,
according to his announcement, of writing at that time. The
questions or pellets are then collected by his wife, and as she
74 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q"
passes around the rear of the hall, she exchanges them for fake
ones. These fake questions she places upon the piano at the
foot of the stage; she then passes back into the dressing room
and the professor makes his appearance, offers up a prayer, has
the audience sing a few songs which he leads, then gives a short
sermon on spiritualism, and the peculiar power that he has of
going under control and allowing the spirits of the departed to
control his hand and write answers to questions. In the mean­
time his wife has taken the original questions into the dressing
room, opened them up and copied them on several large slates
about 10x15. She cuts the questions down and makes them
brief so that they do not take up much space. She will fill the
slate half full of questions, then reverse the slate (not turn it
over, understand, but upside-down), and fill the other half with
questions running the other way. She then places a silicate flap
upon the date covering the questions. She takes four or five of
these slates filled with questions out upon the stage and places
them upon a bare center table with a black top. The professor
then takes up one of the slates, does not call the attention to its
being blank, but thoroughly cleans both sides of it while he is
still conversing with the audience, lays it down upon the table
for a moment with the silicate flap down, thus allowing the
silicate flap to drop out upon the table, which of course is un­
noticed on account of the table being the same color as the flap.
A moment or two later he will pick up the slate and pretend to
write upon it, announcing that his hand is being controlled by
the spirits, when in reality he is simply reading the questions
that his wife, a few minutes before, wrote upon the slate. He
will then call out a name (for illustration), “Mary Jones—John
Jones I feel is controlling my hand and he writes: ‘Be of good
cheer; do not sell your property, but hold it and do not worry,
as I am happy over here, and you should be happy on earth and
accept the offer of marriage that you have’.” The reason he is
able to do this is because Mary Jones, on entering the hall, wrote
John Jones as being passed away; she also wrote her own name
under this and wrote the question: “Shall I accept the offer
.that I have for my property, and would it be advisable for me
to marry the man who has proposed?” He will go on answering
question after question of this kind, the spirits having supposedly
controlled his hand to write. He will rub out the one that he
has just answered making it appear as though he were cleaning
the slate each time. He will also reverse the slate end for end
every now and then, but it is still easy for him to read the ques­
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q" 75
tions, as his wife has written one-half of them one way and one-
half the other way. In the meantime, while he is answering
these questions, his wife has a number of smaller slates with
silicate flaps to fit. She has sorted out a number of good ques­
tions and written the answers to these questions upon the slates,
with the writer’s name at the top and signed with the name of
whoever the party has written as passed away. A little later on
these slates are brought out upon the stage. The professor picks
them up and cleans a number of them, and as he does so he
places them with the silicate flap downward upon the table.
After they are all cleaned he takes them up, two at a time, and
places them together, with a small piece of slate pencil between
them, securing them together with rubber bands. He then re­
quests different parties in the audience to hold the slates upon
their heads, which they do, and then all to rise and sing a hymn.
After the hymn has been sung, he passes down among them and
takes up one pair of slates, opens them up and reads several
messages that his wife has written upon them. These slates as
a rule are bought up by those whom the messages are addressed
to, for from $2.00 to $5.00 per slate. I personally know of one
dear old lady who purchased twenty slates at his different meet­
ings, and always paid $5.00 for each slate, as the messages on
same were always to her from her dear daughter who had passed
away years before, and she could not bear the thought of anyone
having the slate but herself. These messages were always in a
very cheerful vain, and perhaps gave the poor old lady much
happiness; still she had been tricked. At the close of his meet­
ings the professor always announced that he was sorry he had
been unable to answer all of the questions, and that it was more
than likely that those who did not receive answers were not in
the proper state of mind and that they should continue to visit
the meetings (at 50 cents or $1.00 per visit) until they got a
message—or that if they really desired and insisted upon it, his
wife would take their names and he would try and find time
for a private appointment for them (at from $3.50 to $5.00 per
appointment). It was then only a case of consulting the direc­
tories and the other mediums’ "dope” books, and when the dupe
arrived at his parlors he was prepared to give them a very
wonderful reading off-hand.
Once a week, as a rule on Sunday evening, he would give a
very sacred trumpet sermon or seance that for pure graft was
the worst piece of work that I have ever seen. Still every one
in the audience seemed to be convinced and to be a firm believer
76 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q"
and only sorry because they did not get more lengthy messages.
He had a cabinet build upon the stage of a very light black
material about four feet square and six feet high. The cabinet
was bare excepting for an ordinary kitchen chair in the center
of same. Directly in front of the cabinet was a small metal
stand from which was suspended a tin trumpet about three-
quarters of an inch in diameter at the small end and eight inches
in diameter at the large end, and approximately three feet long.
He requested a committee to step upon the stage to prevent any
chance of trickery, and bind his hands behind him through the
rounds of the chair (in the cabinet) with a piece of heavy black
mohair braid, and to secure his feet firmly to the rounds of the
chair with a piece of the same material. As soon as this was
done they were requested to be seated again in the audience.
His wife then steps over to the cabinet, closes same, and places
the trumpet so that the small end is about three inches from the
cabinet and the large end facing directly towards the audience.
He first had the audience write upon a piece of paper the name
of someone departed, then their own name and questions the
same as at his automatic slate writing meetings. His wife would
of course gather these up and exchange them, only at these
meetings the dummy questions were burned in a big brass bowl.
His wife then takes three or four pinches of the ashes and tosses
them into the large end of the trumpet and over the trumpet She
then announces that to make conditions a great deal better the
professor on the inside of the cabinet would go into a deep, dead,
astral trance, so that the spirits of the departed could come and
take possession of his body, thereby strengthening themselves,
and speak through the trumpet. All were then requested to sing
a hymn and on the last chorus a voice in the trumpet joined in
the song. Immediately names were called out and she would re­
quest the party to answer the voice. As the trumpet would call
out the name “John Hicks," she would ask, “Is there a John
Hicks in the audience? If so, speak out loud and say ‘Yes, I am
here’." John Hicks would answer the voice in the trumpet,
and the voice would then say, “This is your sister Mary," and
continue to answer whatever questions he had written, telling
John how happy she was on the other side, etc. Of course this
information had been gained from the questions that John wrote
at the door. The professor’s wife had exchanged the real ques­
tions for the dummy ones, and as she closed up the cabinet she
had tossed the real ones, in a little black bag, to her husband,
who immediately opened them, and on account of the cabinet
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q' 77
having no top he had plenty of light and was able to read them.
He also had in his coat pocket a collapsible trumpet, made on
the order of a traveler’s drinking cup; he would face this to­
wards the audience and imitate different voices, as a rule in a
loud whisper, and thus answer all of the questions. His wife at
different times placed the trumpet at the corners of the cabinet
and sometimes held it in the palms of her hands three or four
feet from the cabinet, but with the large end always facing to­
wards the audience. His using the collapsible trumpet on the
inside of the cabinet facing the audience would naturally throw
the voice out and it would be impossible to distinguish whether
the voice really came from the outside trumpet or not. The
peculiar part of it was all the audience believed it to be so—
where else could it come from? The professor was supposedly
in a trance and securely tied on the inside of the cabinet, but
in reality, the moment the cabinet was closed, he slipped his
right hand from the tape. This was easy as you can readily see
if you will get a piece of one-inch heavy mohair braid thirty-
six inches long, and first allow your left hand to be tied with
just as many knots as desired, and then have the braid passed
back directly through the three or four rounds of the chair and
request them to secure your right hand. The moment they take
the turn around your wrist with the braid, which should only
be long enough to go around once, it leaves only four or five
inches for the knots to be tied. You can now see that it is an
impossibility for them to tie anything but half-hitches, and half­
hitches makes a slip-knot, no matter how many they put in.
78 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OP DR. “Q"
Consequently, the moment the cabinet is closed the two hands
are shoved quickly together, and the thumb and forefinger of
the left hand can pull upon the loop that is around the right
hand. This can also be replaced just as quickly as it is removed,
as a slight pull will tighten the knots.
The professor always proved a great favorite in every city,
as he had a wonderful personality! a kindly face, and always
gave cheerful answers to all questions. I became very well
acquainted with him and he told me of many humorous little
instances that occurred in his work. He was once playing in
the city of O--------, and there becakne acquainted with a stock
broker who was promoting several phony oil deals, and loading
the gullible public up with beautifully engraved certificates of
stock. This broker told the professor that they could make a
lot of money if he would have the spirits tell his dupes to im­
mediately buy stock in one of his companies, and said that he
would give the professor fifty cents on every dollars worth he
sold. The professor could see thousands of dollars rolling in,
and he was very successful in convincing quite a number to
buy stock, but at one meeting a very wealthy old farmer by the
name of Thomas Ross visited his seance. The professor had the
dope that Tom had two years previous to that time lost a brother
by the name of Ed, so at the seance the trumpet called out and
said, “This is Ed Ross; I want to speak to my brother, Tom.”
Tom in the audience spoke up and said, “Yes, Ed, dear brother,
I am here. Are you happy?” Ed through the trumpet said “Yes,
I am very, very happy.” Tom then said “Speak out, dear
brother, tell me any message you have for me,” and Ed said,
“You have great opportunity ahead of you to make a wonderful
lot of money. You can double your capital ten times in the next
year, and I want you to go to a broker by the name of Mr. X-----.
who has some wonderful oil stock, and I want you to buy every
dollars worth of it that you possibly can, as it will make you a
multi-millionaire in a short time.” Tom spoke up and said,
“Brother, I am glad you are happy over there, but I see you
haven’t got over your old habits of trying to steer me wrong
and cause me worry. I am not going to buy the stock because
when you were alive every tip you gave me I lost money on,
and I can’t believe that you have any better dope on the situa­
tion over there than you had when on earth, if you still believe
in oil stock, so good-bye, dear brother.”

THREE-SLATE OFFICE STUNT
AS COMMUNICATED BY DR. “ q ”
The dupe enters the office of the medium. There are three
common school slates lying upon the table, and the medium
directs the sitter to write his name and questions upon one of
the slates, and when he has finished to place same, writing down,
upon the table. The medium then places the sitter’s slate on top
of one of the other slates and then places a third slate upon top
of the sitter’s slate. He then raises the three slates up into the
position, as shown in the illustration, and now on account of
one of the slates being tricked, with the slate only hinged by
one side to the woodwork, he can gaze directly through and
read the sitter’s questions. When he has finished he has but to
draw the top of the slates toward him, place them upon the
table, removes the top slate and requests the sitter to remove
his. The reading is considered very wonderful because to all
appearances the medium had no opportunity of seeing the
sitter’s questions.
These slates were made up by a very fine mechanic, and
even though the slates were examined, it would be almost an
impossibility to tell which was the ticked one—but the ways of
the seer are many.
THE OFFICE SWITCH
AS COMMUNICATED BY DR. “ q ”
This method is perhaps the most universally used by fake
mediums in giving office readings.
The client enters the private sanctorium of the medium. The
furniture of the room consists of an ordinary kitchen table cov­
ered with some oriental throw, upon which is a number of slates,
tablets, crystals, incense pot, several pencils and a number of
pieces of drawing paper about four to six inches. The medium
is seated upon one side of the table and the dupe on the opposite
side. The dupe is handed one of the pieces of paper and re­
quested to write at the top his name, age and occupation, and
underneath that any three or four questions of importance that
he desires to ask, and then to fold up the piece of paper and
place it in the center of the table. The medium has concealed
in his right hand a duplicate blank piece of paper, folded in the
same manner as the one which the dupe has. When the dupe
has finished writing he places his pellet in the center of the
table. The medium takes it with the finger tips of his left hand
and carries it to his forehead, at the same time placing his right
hand to his forehead. Apparently he takes the genuine message,
but in reality with his thumb slightly shoves out the message
marked “B” (as per illustration) and palms the one marked “A”
(as per illustration), places same in his lap and opens it under
cover of the table, and with the right hand takes “B”, or the
duplicate paper, shades his eyes and reads the real message.
After a little preliminary talk he again folds "A” and with the
reversing of the same movements replaces “A” to the forehead
and palms off “B”. He then tells the name of the sitter and his
occupation, and answers his questions, either verbally, or by
supposedly automatic writing upon one of the slates. When the
reading is finished, the medium hands back the genuine ques­
tions to the sitter, and nine times out of ten he will swear that
the questions never left his sight.
This has always been considered a very safe method for
mediums to use, as should their place be raided by police there
would never be any apparatus found, and it is as a rule a very
hard matter to convict these mediums upon a charge of larceny
by trickery or device.
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q” 81
Dr. “Q” told me of a very peculiar experience he had in pre­
senting this method in a southern city. A bright appearing gentle­
man entered his office one afternoon, threw a twenty dollar bill
upon the table and said, “Give me the best reading that you
possibly can.” The Doctor had him write upon one of the pellets,
the same as he did all of his customers, but the man in place of
2 t £ R E A D S A UNPER
COVER oFTABLE.
. RE FOLDS and
REPLACES f l- P A LN S O ff
82 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q”
writing his name, occupation, etc., simply wrote: “I am a detec­
tive, and if you were a genuine medium you would have been
able to know it when I entered this office, and in a moment when
you are reading this paper in your lap, I do not want you to
start any alibis about the conditions not being good, etc. I want
you to reach in your pocket and start to lay bills upon the table
until I tell you that there is plenty, and I do not want one peep
out of you, or you will take a ride in the patrol wagon that will
only last about ten minutes going, but no telling how long it will
take you to return."
When the Doctor had made the switch of the pellets and
read this in his lap, it was an awful jolt, and he considered dis­
cretion better than valor and did as he was told. He reached
into his pocket and started in counting out bills on the table
until his entire bank-roll was in sight. The fake detective
pocketed all of the money, said good afternoon and departed. A
few weeks later Dr. “Q" discovered that the supposed detective
was only a confidence man who had been working the fairs in
that section, and who had some way or other got onto the
Doctor’s clever little system, by which he profited.
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q” 83
DR. “Q” TEST SEANCE
This seance was invented and practiced by Dr. “Q.” It is
given in the light, and the cabinet used is identical with the
cabinet used for the materialization except for the fact that the
front curtain is only about five feet high. In front of this cabinet
are three chairs facing the audience so that the backs of the
chairs are against the curtain of the cabinet.
The meduim calls upon a lady and gentleman from the
audience to be seated in these chairs, always placing the lady in
the center chair and the gentleman in the chair to the right, the
medium occupying the chair on the left. The lady will then
hold the hands of the gentleman to her right and the medium
will then place both of his hands upon the lady’s bare arm. A
black curtain is then placed in front of them, and pinned around
their necks, leaving their heads exposed to the sitters. Inside
the cabinet, directly back of them, is placed a small table with
writing material, tambourines, guitar, bells, etc., or in fact any­
thing that the medium wishes to have the ghosts or spirits
manipulate.
In this seance the manifestations consist of ringing the
bells, beating of the tambourines, strumming the guitar, getting
messages, etc. (The messages, as a rule, are prepared before
the seance.) The medium in presenting this seance will allow
a few of the sitters to look over into the cabinet, but as the noise
ceases the minute they look, the only satisfaction they receive is
that there is absolutely no one in the cabinet. The lady sitting
in the center chair will positively swear that she at all times
had hold of the hands of the gentleman on her right and that the
medium had never released her arm.
This makes a very satisfactory test seance, especially if the
medium will allow different ladies and gentlemen to occupy the
chairs, to convince the sitters that there are no confederates.
In presenting this manner of manifestation, the medium in
taking hold of the lady’s bare arm will place his left hand above
his right, and will take a very firm grip upon her arm, and after
sitting thus for a few moments gradually grips very tightly with
his left hand, which is close to her elbow, thus stopping the cir­
culation, and gradually releases his right hand, unbeknown to
the lady. On having his right hand free he can reach into the
cabinet and handle the tambourines, bells, etc., .and produce
spirit hands above their heads, and then by gradually placing
84 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q”
his right hand back upon the lady’s arm, everything is ready for
inspection.
MATERIALIZATION
Materialization is where the spirit of a departed human
being is supposed to again take on a material form, and appear
as they did on earth. This differs completely from etherealiza-
tion, as an ethereal form is supposed to be composed of vapor
only. This peculiar form of phenomena of mediumship is the
most trying and the hardest of all for the medium to practice,
and it is'always very dangerous, as some wise or skeptical in­
vestigator might stick a knife into the spirit in order to determine
the genuineness of this so-called phase of mediumship, and as
that has been the case several times, the medium, in order to
muster up courage and nerve, as a rule is addicted to the use of
habit-forming drugs, or liquor. There are, of course, exceptions
to this rule, as there are some mediums who give this manner
of manifestation only to a select few of their most ardent friends
and followers, whom they can bank on to swallow any manner
or kind of demonstration that the medium sees fit to call a
demonstration from the spirit world. This class o f followers
will swear by all that is holy that the medium is genuine; even
though the medium should be caught, they will readily explain
that it was an impersonation, a peculiar phase of mediumship,
similar to that of materialization, the medium claiming that
when the force and conditions are not strong enough to take
on the material form, they send the medium from the cabinet
to impersonate the spirit that wishes to communicate. This is
generally practiced by women, because they are better prepared
to carry the paraphernalia than men.
. In giving this class of seance the medium uses a cabinet.
These cabinets are, as a rule, made on a square frame covered
with black muslin. Generally, the average medium has a black
curtain of the same material across the corner of the room, and
also has a black background, and the floor under the cabinet
covered with the same material. This sort of a seance is given
in dark rooms, with just enough light to distinguish the spirit's
as they emerge from the cabinet. The medium in these seances,
as a rule, sits inside of the cabinet, and is supposed to be in a
trance, and not conscious of any of the manifestations that are
taking place, .but, as a matter of fact, is about the busiest person
in the world at this time.
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q” 85
These seances open up, as a rule, with singing of hymns by
the sitters, as it is a belief among spiritualists that it gives the
proper condition for all spiritual manifestations, and is very
essential in the seance, as it gives the medium time to imper­
sonate the desired spirit. And then, it becomes necessary for
the sitters to sing again, in order to give the spirits more
strength, this giving the medium more time to change his or her
make-up.
Those of you who have attended these seances, have per­
haps noticed that they are composed of singing, then the spirits,
and singing, and then spirits again, etc., etc. This phase of
mediumship requires more paraphernalia than any other, and
the medium should be well supplied with this make-up. The
make-up consists of gauze silk painted on one side with luminous
paint (this can be purchased from any magical dealer; the Devoe
paint is considered the best). Women practice this more than
men. They have an underskirt made of this material, the under­
side painted with the luminous paint. There is no danger of
detection with this paint, as it will not show except in the dark.
They also carry an additional supply of similar gauze painted in
this manner, so as to be able to produce three or four spirits of
different sizes at the same time. This, of course, makes a very
convincing test. The gauze used in this so-called demonstration
is so flimsy that several yards can be placed into an ordinary
wine glass. Mediums giving this kind of seance can carry in an
empty watchcase an abundant supply of this material, so if they
were searched it would not be found.
Some mediums use what is called a reaching rod, which is a
small tool a little larger than a lead pencil, having smaller tubes
on the inside and worked in the same manner as the telescope.
These are, as a rule, about three or four feet long when pulled
out. On the smaller end of this rod is a little clasp, similar to
a necktie holder, which can be used to float these so-called spirits
around the room. Sometimes these reaching rods are hollow,
and the medium can talk through them and carry the impression
that the voice is that of a spirit •This is very convincing, as the
medium in the cabinet can be heard to cough, and a second later
the voice of the spirit can be heard in the center of the room.
Mediums should always talk in a whisper, and be very careful
not to let their lips meet in doing so, as it would then be easy
to detect that it was made by human agency. They should also
be able to change their voices at will.
86 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q”
Dr. “Q,” in giving this phase of mediumship, told me that he
always used a black handkerchief, black gloves, and as the back­
ground and the cabinet were black, he was able to move about
in front of the cabinet without detection, and by having about
three yards of painted gauze he would bring these supposed
spirits out of the cabinet on the floor, and then cause them to
dematerialize down through the floor. In order to materialize
four spirits at once, it was necessary for him to take off both
shoes, and by wrapping a piece of luminous gauze around his
feet, and then using both hands, he could produce spirits to the
entire satisfaction of all the sitters. This placing of the luminous
gauze over the feet may possibly account for the graveyard
smell that some of the spirits sometimes possessed. As one old
lady remarked after she had been up to the cabinet to get a
message from her deceased husband: “I am sure it was John,
because he smelled just exactly like he did the day we buried
him, as we had kept him until mortification set in, so that we
would be absolutely sure that there was no life before we in­
terred his body into the ground.”
Dr. “Q" at one time had a lady assistant who used to give
seances of this kind. She used to have the lining of all her
clothes made of this luminous gauze, and when entering the
cabinet she would take off her clothes, turn them wrong side
out, and materialize many different shapes and forms.
Can you imagine the consternation that would have been
wrought in a seance of this kind, if the lights had been turned
quickly on while the medium was thus materializing?
The medium also carries in her skirts, attached to little
snaps, a number of pieces of black cardboard, upon which are
painted white hands, skulls, hearts, crosses, diamonds, and a
number of different hieroglyphics, and should a person ask a
question, she would immediately place one of these little hiero­
glyphics in front of them, and later on would ask them to tell
what they had seen, and they would describe it. As these were
described to her, she would interpret the meaning to her sitters,
for a small remuneration of course.
It is a wonderful thing what imagination will do in one of
these seances. People whom you would swear would never
allow their imagination to run away with them, will swear that
they recognized departed friends, where in reality all they have
seen is a little luminous rag. But there are many spiritualists
today who cannot swallow this kind of a manifestation. It is
seemingly too material to be spiritual.
CLAIRVOYANCE AND CLAIRAUDIENCE
These phases of* spiritualism or mediumship, are usually
practiced by a class of mental cripples who are unable to per­
form the more complicated phases of so-called mediumship. The
word clairvoyance means seeing, or an insight into the spirit
world. The mediums practicing this claim that through their
wonderful power of second sight they are able to see and describe
disembodied spirits, and also to receive messages by signs and
symbols; also to see transpiring events, and that it is possible
for them to look behind the curtain that hides your past, and
break the veil that obscures your future. This differs from
what is called clairaudience, as clairaudience means to hear and
converse with spirits. These two phases of mediumship work
hand in hand. A medium practicing both is supposed to be able
to see and describe these spirits, and also to talk with them.
This is not much of an improvement over the old Gypsy
fortune-teller, who crones over a dirty pack of cards, or who
looks into the palm of your hand. Their entire secret lies in
being a fair reader of human nature and a close observer, having
unlimited nerve, and being a fair guesser. Should one of their
predictions come true, they will herald their powers in big
printed advertisements, and add many converts to their list of
dupes. But never a word is said about the hundreds of their
predictions that don’t come true.
They will give you a reading by telling you that you are
very fond of the better things of life, music, art, etc.; that your
real inner-self demands the refined part of nature; that you are
blessed with a good disposition, perhaps a little too supersensi­
tive at times; that you have not as yet attained your real ambi­
tions, and very few people realize the wonderful ideals that you
really possess; that you are too sympathetic; have a strong will
power, but lack the confidence of carrying it out on account of
the early part of your life being fate—not a case of what you
yourself desired to do, but a case of what circumstances forced
and compelled you to do.
A great many of these mediums have a smattering of
astrology, and will ask you your date of birth, and tell you the
natural astrological conditions that exist around your sign, which
of course, is very convincing; and too, they will perhaps consult
87
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q”
the medium’s dope book that is filled with information that they
have gained from other mediums.
This class of fakirs is very detrimental to a community. The
mere fact that they, as a rule, are failures themselves, proves
that they have poor judgment, and that advice based upon this
judgment naturally causes many of the clients to be failures and
absconders. It is surprising how many bright and intelligent
people, even smart business men, follow the advice of these
fortune-tellers. I personally have known of eight bankers who
have absconded with the funds of the poor, through following
the advice of these people. And I know of over thirty once
honest people who followed advice of this kind, and are today
serving time in prison cells.
THE MASTER SECRET OF MADAM LA ROSE, THE
GIFTED (?) SPIRIT MEDIUM
The gifted (?) Madam fooled the wisest of the wise for a
long time, and is perhaps still doing so. The Madam used to
charge her callers from two to ten dollars each, for what she
termed sacred musical sittings. You would visit her apartment,
and as for proof that your loved ones, who had passed away,
were happy on the other side, she would ask you to take an old
guitar and examine it thoroughly, place it on her lap, and with­
out her touching the strings music would issue from the guitar.
If you were skeptical you could bring your own guitar, and it
would play just the same. The music really issued from the
guitar. She explained that the spirits did the playing. It was
inexplicable, and you could examine the guitar at any time, and
even place your ear against the instrument, and to all appear­
ances the music really came from the instrument. She could
get up and walk around the room, carrying the guitar with her,
and the music would still issue from the instrument, even though
her hands did not touch the strings. It was very uncanny, very
mysterious, and for several years, to our personal knowledge,
she cleaned up small fortunes in western towns, and no one was
ever able, or seemingly able, to discover her secret, which was
as follows:
She had concealed in her bodice a small Swiss music box,
and had a string running from the starting and stopping device
of same to her belt. Soldered to the metal sounding board of
the music box, was a steel pin, about three-quarters of an inch
89
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q”
in length, that protruded through her belt buckle, and as the
guitar was handed to her she would place same against the pin,
pull the string at her belt, the music box would start to play, and
on account of the pin touching the guitar would vibrate the in*
strument so that it was impossible to tell but what the music
was really issuing from the guitar.
I personally know of one family, who had lost a daughter,
that paid her over $600.00 for these musical seances. Her method
was for the first; few seances to have the so-called spirits play
sad pieces, and she would tell the sitters that those on the other
side were not very happy, because if they were, they would play
joyful pieces. So that they could be made happy, and better
conditions brought about for them in spirit life, she would sell
the dupes incense candles, to be taken home and burned, at
prices ranging from one to fifty dollars. And later on there
would be further sittings, at which the spirit of the departed
would play joyful melodies upon the guitar, thus proving to the
dupe that the sacred candles and incense furnished by her had
brought about the desired effect.
In the hands of any honest magician, presented purely as
magic, this would have a wonderful effect upon an audience,
purely as a matter of amusement.
MYSTERIOUS TABLE RAPS, WITH AN UNPREPARED
TABLE
AS PERFORMED AND COMMUNICATED BY DR. “q ”
The medium carried no apparatus whatever, nevertheless,
at any time, he was able to produce those mysterious table raps
that are so loved by those interested in spiritual phenomena.
And the manner in which Dr. “Q” presented it had a wonderful
effect upon his audience.
At any of his seances the conversation concerning spiritual*
istic table raps would usually come up. The Doctor's conversa­
tion would generally be as follows:
“For years I have found that there are many spirits that
desire to communicate with us, and that if we are not sensitive
enough to allow ourselves to go under control, or be able to take
on the direct conditions of them, they many times manifest
themselves by raps on different objects in the room. You all
have perhaps sometimes, probably when you were just about to
fall asleep, heard raps upon the wall, on the dresser, or upon
the foot-board of the bed. This should be a proof to you that
there was someone in ethereal life that was trying to com­
municate with you, and if you had developed your psychic
forces to the degree that you perhaps could have, you would
have been able to have heard them speak to you. Or, if only
partially developed, you would have been able to have placed a
trumpet upon the table, and they would have spoken to you,
but seeing this was not the case with you, their only method
of communication lay in raps.
“For some reason that I cannot explain to you, it seems that
they have always, or at least for many years, been able to com­
municate their wishes by rapping upon different objects. One
rap as a rule, in answer to any mental or audible query, would
mean ‘Yes.’ Two raps would mean ‘No.’ And three raps, in
answer to your query, would mean that they were doubtful or
that your question was not worded in such a manner that they
could answer same. Let us try the experiment. We have here
a plain center table; there are no electrical connections or de­
vices of any kind connected with it, as you can readily see. Let
us sit in a circle around the table, and place our hands upon it,
and see if it is not possible to make conditions such that we can
90
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q” 91
get in rapport with those on the other side, and have them
answer any query that we have in our minds. Let us assist them
as much as we possibly can. When any one of us has a question,
let us ask it out loud, so that all in the circle can hear it, and
let us all concentrate upon the question, and in that way be
able to get it over to the other side. (Here they all sit at the
table, place their hands flat upon same, thumbs touching and
little fingers of each hand touching the little fingers of the parties
next to them in the circle.) Let us be sure that the chain of
hands is not broken, and let us listen very intently, throw our
minds at ease as much as possible. I will call up a friend of
mine. All concentrate upon him. He was a very tall, dark-
complected man, had a dark mustache and clean-shaven square
chin. He was a friend of mine for many years, and passed away
in an accident. His name was John Dryfus, and he has come
to me many times, both with raps, through the trumpet, and in
spirit form. ‘John, kindly answer if you hear us.' ‘John, kindly
answer if you will communicate with us.' (One rap is faintly
heard in the center of the table.) Friends, John is here. ‘John,
will you kindly rap upon the table how many of us are sitting
at the table.’ (Seven raps are faintly heard.) That is right
friends, there are seven of us here. ‘John, will you kindly
answer if it is possible for you to get in touch on the other side
with spirit friends of those who are sitting at the table.’ (One
rap is heard.) Friends, that means yes. Now, is there any one
present who has some friend on the other side with whom they
would like to communicate. (A lady speaks up, and says, ‘Yes,
I would like to communicate with my brother.’) ‘John, get this
lady’s brother for her.’ (One rap occurs on the table.) ‘Is the
lady’s brother here?’ (One tap.) Lady, will you kindly speak
out loud your question to your brother, so that we all may be
able to concentrate upon it, and thus have it clearly trans­
mitted to your brother. (The lady speaks and says, ‘Brother, is
this you?’ One tap very loud upon the table.) Yes, lady, there
is your brother; ask him anything you desire. (The lady says,
‘Brother, are you happy over there?’ One loud tap on the table.
Medium interprets same by saying ‘Yes lady, your brother is
very happy.)” The lady continues.asking questions that are
answered by yes, no, and doubtful, and the others around the
circle call up different friends of theirs, and they are answered
also by yes, no, and doubtful, and whatever answers the medium
ftt to give them, because he has absolute control over the
S'.s at all times, and the secret is this:
92 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q”
Take a flat-topped table, place your hands firmly upon it,
with your thumb nails close together, and by rubbing one thumb
nail against the other, with considerable pressure, which move­
ment is always imperceptible, a tapping sound will be com­
municated to the table. A litle practice, and it becomes ab­
solutely impossible of detection, and by a little suggestion to
your auditors, they can be led to believe that the taps come from
different parts of the table. With the lights turned low, and a
red globe substituted for white, and the medium speaking in a
slow, monotonous voice, the effect is very weird and uncanny,
especially if now and then the medium says: “I can see a vague
form behind you, an elderly man with gray hair,” etc. Sugges­
tions of this kind have their effect upon the minds of the audi­
tors, and all thought of trickery is quickly banished from their
minds. With the information that the medium, as a rule, has
obtained from his dope book on his sitters,' some marvelous tests
can be presented. It is simplicity itself; nevertheless, I have
known of hundreds of people whom it was impossible for me to
convince that they had been tricked, and they would still con­
tinue to go to sittings of this kind, paying from 50c to $10.00
per sitting, all of the time believing that they were developing
their marvelous latent spiritual forces. The main reason that it
was impossible to convince them of trickery, was that the
medium always gave them cheerful messages that made them
feel happier to know that those on the other side were happy
and that they were not forgotten.
This is only one of the many ingenious methods used by
fraudulent mediums to trick their dupes into the belief that it is
possible for them to call up the spirits of the departed.
Dr. “Q” related to me a very humorous incident that oc­
curred one evening when he was presenting this table-rapping
method of communication at the home of a very wealthy gentle­
man in Pittsburg, who had a dozen or more friends present to
enjoy same. Everything was going along lovely until one elderly
gentleman spoke up and said: “Why is it that you cannot get
these raps at home, alone, without the assistance of any medium.
Why is it that everyone present can not go into the silence of
their own room and immediately get into communication with
those in spirit life whom they desire, without having to pay a
fee to some medium for the privilege?” Dr. “Q” spoke up and
said: “Friend, you have a wonderful argument—for man who
does not think. Let me give you a thorough explanation, one
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q” 93
that will end this argument for once and all in your mind. Name
some friend of yours who is living in the city." The elderly
gentleman named his son, who was living in a distant part of
the city. Dr. "Q” said: "Kindly go to the telephone and call
your son up, and ask concerning his health and the health of his
family, and bid him good-night.” The elderly gentleman did
this in the presence of the entire circle. Dr. “Q” now said: “If
it were not possible for you to have used the medium of the
telephone and the girl in the central office, how would you have
called your son up? How would you have asked concerning his
health and the health of his family? Is it not a fact that you
have to pay for the use of the telephone? Is it not a fact that
the girl that gave you the.connection to your son’s house is en­
titled to a remuneration for her services?" The circle was
thoroughly convinced, the old man was nonplussed, and rejoined
the circle,'and proved to be one of the best financial donators
to the cause of the celebrated Doctor, and continued for many
months to pay the medium’s toll for connecting him to those in
the spirit world by the way of table rapping. He joined the
development class, for which he paid a substantial fee, until at
last his mind became so upset and obsessed that he imagined
he could hear raps all around him, both night and day, and it
would have been impossible for anyone to have convinced him
that he was not legitimately in touch with the other side.
Nevertheless, in all due fairness to honest spiritualists and
their belief that the spirits can communicate by raps, the mere
fact of Dr. “Q” and other fake mediums presenting experiments
of this kind by trickery does in no way prove that the legitimate
cannot exist. But in relating incidents of this kind, it is simply
my hope and belief that this explanation may save someone
from becoming a dupe and a mental wreck from so simple a
trick as this.
THE MYSTERIOUS DARK TRUMPET SEANCE OF
DR. ”Q”
AS COMMUNICATED BY DR. “ q ”
This is perhaps the most mysterious of all trumpet seances.
Apparatus, which is now manufactured and sold by magical
dealers, consists of a tin trumpet twenty-four inches in length,
with a turned wooden mouthpiece in the smaller end. This is
given for examination, but the medium has concealed under his
vest a block of wood that just-fits the larger end of the trumpet.
On this block of wood, on the inside, are eight nails protruding
about one-sixteenth of an inch, that hold a card two and one-
quarter by three and one-half inches, and also a little shielded
electric light globe that is operated by the pressure of a button
on the bottom side, as the entire wooden block conceals a small
flash-light battery.
The Doctor used to advertise his trumpet seance, and hold
same at his apartments, with perhaps ten to thirty people at­
tending. The room was entirely bare except for chairs, the
trumpet, a small center table, and a number of cards. His lecture
was as follows:
94
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q" 95
“My dear friends, we -are here this evening for the purpose
of concentrating all of our forces with the object in view of
being able to bridge the great chasm that separates us from our
loved ones who have gone on before. It will more than likely
be possible, if our minds are placed in the right condition, that
we may be able to produce that greatest of all phenomena, spirit
voices, and so that the voices may be distinct, I call your atten­
tion to this small trumpet, which we will place in the center of
the room. It may be, even though we are all banded together
for a good purpose, that some of you might be suspicious regard­
ing my connection with the work, and for that reason I will be
seated in this chair, and I would like to have a committee of
you secure my hands through the back rounds of the chair,
making it an impossibility for me to move or to change my
position in the room without your being able to detect same.
(The operation of escaping, or being able to remove your
hands at random, when tied with mohair braid or rope through
the back of the chair, is clearly explained elsewhere in this
book.) I would also like all of you to take cards from the table,
and at the top of the card write the name of someone who has
passed into spirit life, someone who was perhaps near and dear
to you, someone whom you would be able to trust if you were
to receive an answer from them. After you have written their
name, write your own clearly, and then any two or three ques­
tions that are troubling you at the present time. After you have
finished writing, I will request all of you to place the writing
side downward upon the center table in the middle of the room.
(They all write, as he directs, and place upon the center table
four or five feet from the Doctor. The Doctor is secure, so it
would be an utter impossibility, of course, to reach or touch
them.) Friends, I will request you all to sit in a circle around
the edge of the room, and hold hands so that your forces may
all act together. We will then have the lights turned out, so
that your mind may not be detracted by things that your vision
would probably bring before you, and if you are all honest in
your purpose, and not holding doubtful thoughts in your mind,
to conflict with those who are holding the right mental condi­
tion, there is no doubt but what we will have wonderful success.
Do not try to get the voices to give you too much. Do not argue
with them, and do not complain in case all of your questions
are not answered.” The lights are turned out, and immediately
the Doctor loosens his hands, reaches for the trumpet, and re­
moves the concealed end of the trumpet that he has under his
96 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q"
vest, reaches for one of the cards, turns it writing side up upon
this block of wood between the nails, places the trumpet over
the same, and his eye close up against the supposed mouthpiece;
he then presses the little button on the bottom of the wooden
fake, which turns on the light, and he is able to clearly see the
card, although all the rest of the room is in darkness. We will
say that the card has upon it, “Mary Jones, passed away,” and
underneath that the name of John Jones, her son, who will per­
haps write, “Is it better that I should remain here in business,
or would I be more successful if I went away?” and the Doctor,
in a low tone of voice, or whisper, as a rule, to start with will
say: “This is Mary Jones; I want to speak—I want to speak—
I want to speak to my son John.” The Doctor then takes the
trumpet away from his mouth, and says: “John, answer your
mother when-she speaks to you.” John says: “Yes mother, this
is me.” The Doctor then speaks through the trumpet, interpret­
ing the voice of Mary Jones, and says: “John, we are all very
happy over here, and we are all more than pleased to see that
you have taken the interest that you have in us by trying to
communicate with us, and that you have not forgotten, as many
have done. As to your business, I see a complete change. This
change has come to you several times. We have tried to place
it in your mind, and if you make this change, success will be
your reward. This may be a little slow, but it eventually will
come,”—and so the Doctor goes on, one question after another,
reading them through the little fake that he places on the bot­
tom of the trumpet, and each times he places the cards on the
table, being, of course, sure to turn the writing side down. He
gives everyone a message, and more than likely informs them
that if they develop, it should only be a matter of time until
they are able to communicate without having to attend the
seances, and in a short time will perhaps sell everyone that at­
tends the seance, a trumpet, which he tells them has been
magnetized, and that perhaps costs him fifty cents to be made
at a tin shop, for which he charges them from $5.00 to $10.00,
and even as high at $100.00.
This test convinced hundreds to the belief of “Spiritualism,”
and this mystery, or secret was never discovered until he im­
parted it to me just before his death.
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q' 97
SPECIFICATIONS
The outfit consists of a metal trumpet with a wooden tip
(figure 1), and a wooden base (figures 2, 3, 4 and 5). The metal
trumpet should fit over the base tight enough to pick the base
up. This is accomplished by glueing felt around the base as
shown at F, figure 2. The wooden base (figures 2, 3, 4 and 5) is
made in two pieces—top section “A”, figure 2, and bottom section
“B”, figure 2. The bottom section is screwed to the top section
by two screws ("CC”, figure 2). The inside of the base is cut
out to form space for battery; a hole is bored at “A”, figure 3,
PU* of Sot* —pVf.j
98 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q”
for lamp stem to fit in. This lamp is held solid by metal band
(“D”, figure 2), which is screwed to the wood. The small metal
shield “E”, figure 2, is screwed to the top of the base and acts
as a protector for the lamp, and also keeps the light from show­
ing into the eyes of the operator when using. The battery used
is a small flat flashlight battery. One side of the battery makes
connection directly to the lamp as shown at “B”, figure 3, the
other side makes connection against' screw "C”, figure 3, which
in turn is connected to a spring brass lever (“A”, figure 5) by
a small wire. This brass lever has a push button (“A”, figure 4)
fastened to it, and when button is pushed up it makes connection
at “B”, figure 4, causing the lamp to light. Small round-headed
pins, shown at "X", figure 3, are driven into the top of the base
to hold the card in position when using.
The details of the blue print are exact size and easy to
manufacture. The tin trumpet can be made by a tinsmith for
.approximately fifty cents, and any wood-joiner or wood-turner
can turn the wooden tip for the top of the trumpet and the base
as well. The operation of the apparatus is simplicity itself. The
complete base fits nicely under the vest or in coat pocket and
is never seen by the spectators.
The minute the lights are turned out, the. operator takes
the base in his hand, reaches and gets a card and places it be­
tween the pins marked "X”, figure 3. He then places the trumpet
over the base, holds it to his eye, presses the push button on
the bottom which naturally throws light over the card so same
can be correctly and easily read. The trumpet is held in the
right hand, finger moved from push button, and card placed
back on the corner of the table. While doing this trumpet is
held to the mouth, and operator, disguising his voice, answers
the questions he has just read, and as the answers are being
given he reaches for another card with the left hand, places
same upon the base all ready to read, and so on until all have
been answered. A little practice and you will readily see how
easy it is, with the aid of the trumpet, to change your voice in
such a manner that it is an utter impossibility for anyone to
recognize it.
There is only one chance of detection, and that would be
for someone to turn on the lights. You should either have the
lights operated by a friend in whom you can place confidence,
or as Dr. “Q” did, have a main switch under the floor operated
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q” 99
by a string running along the edge of the carpet, so that any
time the lights are turned off, to make it doubly sure, with the
string pull the main switch, so that in case someone should be
skeptical and try to turn on the light during the seance, the
light would refuse to operate. It is careful attention to little
details of this kind that makes mysteries wonderful and im­
possible of detection, because if this experiment is properly
handled by a magician, he can give a full evening’s enter­
tainment.
TRUMPET SEANCE
Trumpet mediums make use of a trumpet from two and
one-half to three feet long. It is generally made of tin, brass,
or aluminum. Some even use them made of papier mache, or
fibre. These trumpets are about four to five inches in diameter
at the larger end, and taper down to about three-quarters of
an inch at the smaller end. There is no regulation size, as every
medium seems to have their own ideas. They explain as the
object of the trumpet that it helps the spirit to vocalize, and
that there are millions of spirits whose voices you would not be
able to hear unless they were magnified in the trumpet—the
same as if we desire to speak a long distance, we would perhaps
use a megaphone.
It is advisable for mediums to—in fact all mediums do—wet
their trumpets on the inside, claiming that the dampness helps
the spirits to vocalize. But of course, the real object is to keep
the dupes from becoming suspicious, because after the medium
has talked through the trumpet for some time, it would be easy
to detect the moisture caused by the medium’s voice on the in­
side of the trumpet. This is perhaps the reason why many
mediums use papier mache trumpets. Another object is per­
haps so that the sitter cannot smell the medium’s breath, whether
onions or whiskey. This also gives a sort of graveyard rattle
to the spirit voices. Therefore, you can readily see what an
essential thing it is for the medium to wet the trumpet.
There are several methods of trumpet seances. Perhaps the
simplest, and most practiced way, is always given in the dark.
Another is only practiced by a few mediums, and is given with
semi-light—that is, just enough light to distinguish everything
in the room. And as a rule, they give etherealization in this
seance. It is sometimes called Trumpet and Etherealization
Seance. But as a general thing, these semi-dark seances end
100 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q”
up with a dark seance. That is, after the medium has convinced
his sitters that he took no pail in the performance of the semi­
dark seance. The medium uses no cabinet, but after forming a
circle around the room, and after all have been seated and joined
hands, and the lights have been extinguished, the Lord's prayer
has been said, and a few songs have been sung, the medium will
have the trumpet in his or her possession, and in order to gain
the confidence of the sitters on both sides, the medium will place
a mouthpiece on the trumpet, and by placing the trumpet be­
tween his or her knees, will ask everyone to take hold of hands
until the spirits begin to manifest. After the head control has
made a few opening remarks everyone will release hands, the
medium then having both hands to manipulate the trumpet. In
the semi-light seances, the cabinet used is exactly like that used
in materialization, with the exception that the back cloth on
the floor extends out into the center of the room, and the
trumpet is placed on the inside of the cabinet. The medium sits
on one side of the cabinet. The light used in these seances is
a small kerosene lamp, and is placed in the farthest corner of
the room, and is so arranged as to throw the light upon the
center of the cabinet. This is done by placing a piece of paper
around the lamp, leaving a small space for the light to shine
through. Some mediums have a small box to set this light in.
This is much better, as this leaves the medium in .the dark. After
having the seance room prepared in this manner, the medium is
ready to demonstrate his powers.
In the semi-dark seahces, the medium cannot talk directly
into the trumpet, so he or she must have in their possession a
rubber hose about three feet in length. This hose is so pliable
that it can be flattened and rolled into a very small compact
form, and held together with a wide rubber band. One end of
this hose must have a small mouthpiece, painted black like the
hose. The other end slips over the small end of the trumpet, and
with the aid of black gloves, and a black handkerchief to cover
the medium’s shirt bosom, the medium is able to entertain the
sitters; and to further strengthen the belief of his followers the
trumpet will lay in the center of the room, in view of all present.
The hose being black, the same as the cloth on the floor, it is
impossible to detect it. The medium talking into the end of the
hose forces the voice through the hose to the trumpet; and the
spectators, seeing the outline of the medium many feet away,
are perfectly satisfied with the results.
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. *
‘Q” 101
With the aid of a few controls, which are as a rule composed
of some great doctor, and a few Indian spirits, such as White
Feather, etc., and last, but not least by any means, a little child
control, as a rule called Bright Eyes, who has the wisdom of a
grown-up of sixty years of age, to come and give an abundant
supply of good advice, and with a few yards of painted gauze,
such as is used in materializations, the medium is able to pro­
duce etherealization, and to have these ethereal forms talk in
independent voices, without the aid of the trumpet, which as a
rule, are merely whispers.
After the end of these wonderful demonstrations, the lights
are extinguished, in order that the sitters may be able to get
much more marvelous results. The medium can then, by stand­
ing up and with the aid of the rubber hose, slide the end of the
trumpet along the ceiling, and by talking into the mouthpiece
of the hose, give the impression that the trumpet is sliding
around upon the ceiling and that the spirits are communicating
through it. After this experiment, lights can be seen to float
around the room, and in order to get more conditions, etc., etc.,
an Indian chief will amuse the sitters by giving them some poor
imitations of a steamboat, railroad train, saw-mill, or some of
the' wild animals of the forest. After this, the medium’s head
control will give you a few closing remarks, and then, in order
for the meduim to put away his hose, etc., the little child con­
trol will come and talk independent of the trumpet, giving you
a world of advice and good cheer, and with a “Good wishes to
you," the seance ends.
In this class of seance, the medium must be able to change
his voice from a deep bass to the voice of a woman. The hardest
voice is that of a child, as it must have that childish prattle.
Mediums with tender voices find this the easiest. It is one of
the most essential things in the seance, as no seance is complete
without one of these little child controls to call every one
mamma or papa. It is always a drawing card, and proves a big
asset to the medium.
MENTAL PROJECTION EXTRAORDINARY
AS COMMUNICATED BY DR. “ q ”
EFFECT
The medium states that he will write on a slip of paper or
small card three or four items, as for instance the name of some
well-known person; the name of a certain day of the week; the
name of a certain color and a certain number between 1 and
1,000,000. This he apparently does, but without letting anyone
see what he really 'writes. After finishing his writing the per­
former folds in half and seals in the ordinary manner.
Taking a second slip of paper the medium now states that
he will demonstrate the theory of PROJECTION IN THOUGHT.
He then goes on to remark about the development of so-called
“mental influence” and the possibility to cause the same thought
waves to be transferred throughout the entire assembly, if the
experiments are conducted along scientific lines.
The medium may proceed as follows: “Now, friends, I have
written several things on a slip of paper and sealed same in this
envelope. No one knows what the writings are, and yet I pro­
pose to cause you yourselves to assert a correct mental impres­
sion of what I have already written. When I say the word 'com­
mence' I desire you to call aloud the name of the very first per-:
son that enters your mind. COMMENCE!”
Now, whatever name is called, the performer writes on the
slip of paper which he holds, apparently as a matter of memo­
randum. In the same way the spectators are requested to call
the day of the week, the color, and the number, which the per­
former also makes a note of on his paper as they are called.
The medium should make a great point of the fact that in
no way does he influence their choice, and that whatever they
do is of their own free will in each and every case. At the finish
of this part of the experiment the medium reads aloud the items
which the spectators have themselves called out, which we will
suppose to be Lincoln, Wednesday, Blue and 192.
The medium now opens envelope and removes paper upon
which he had previously written his own deductions, and which
prove to be identical with those called by the spectators.
102
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q” 103
FIRST METHOD
This effect is brought about by very simple means. Prepare
an envelope with a sheet of very sensitive black pencil carbon
paper, with impression side facing the back. This envelope is
the topmost one of several which the medium holds in his hand.
When he writes the supposed items on the slip of paper at the
beginning of the experiment he really writes nothing, but merely
pretends to do so. After this he folds the paper in half and in­
serts same in envelope, but in doing so he takes care that the
carbon paper passes between the folded slip. Taking another
slip of paper, which he holds in place on top of the same en­
velope, the spectators are now requested to call their choice,
and upon this being done, the medium jots it down on the paper,
in order, as he says, to guard against any misunderstanding.
What really happens is that he receives the duplicate carbon
impression on the inside of the folded paper within the envelope.
After the medium calls aloud the items as given him by the
spectators, all that remains to do is to rip open this envelope
and produce the paper, which now of course contains the identi­
cal of the chosen writings. As paper is removed the envelope
is carelessly crushed in the hand and tossed aside.
SECOND METHOD
In this method no prepared envelope is used, but instead the
medium must secretly write on a thin card with a short lead
pencil. This can either be done with one hand in the trouser
pocket or while hands are held behind the back, the card being
transferred from one hand to the other several times during his
gestures while addressing the spectators, and which with a little
practice can be done without any suspicion whatsoever. .
At the beginning the medium first writes, or pretends to do
;so, on a similar card, which he conceals in an envelope and gives
to a party to hold. At the conclusion of the effect the medium
holds palmed the written card, and after taking his hand from
the envelope, and in apparently removing card already inside
the envelope, the palmed one is brought into view instead.
It is also well to fold cards in four, when using this method,
as the small folded billet is much easier to handle than the full-
sized card would be.
If it is desired to work this effect up with the aid of an as-
.sistant a wonderful result can be obtained in the following man­
ner: The medium’s lady assistant, for instance, has in her secret
104 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q”
possession a small blank card and a short stub pencil. The
medium introduces her as being possessed or rare mental attain-
ments, in being able to correctly foretell what certain people
will think of, and he hands her a visiting card, upon which she
writes several items. This card is then sealed in an envelope
and left in plain sight. The spectators are then requested to
call out several items, as previously explained, and in order to
verify same the medium writes them on a slate with chalk.
While this is being done the medium’s lady assistant writes
the same on the second blank card unobserved. A pellet of soft
wax has previously been attached to back of envelope first
shown and containing the first sealed card. After writing the
chosen words on a slate, performer again takes this envelope
and has several persons write their initials on the face of same.
The thought finally strikes him to have his lady assistant
write her initials also, and as she takes card in her hand, which
contains the second card palmed, it is pressed on back of the
envelope where it adheres by means of the wax.
Taking a pair of scissors the end of the envelope is clipped
off, but instead of removing the card from the envelope, the one
on the back is brought forth, the effect being that it was really
the one previously sealed therein.
SEALED LETTER READING
AS COMMUNICATED BY DR. “ q ”
In this particular test no waxed pads are used, but with a
little preparation and a neat and simple sleight, which is never
noticed, the same result can be obtained.
The secret lies in the envelope, which is first given to one
of your audience, with a slip of paper within which is prepared
to receive a carbon impression. Prepare envelope as follows:
Take a lightweight business envelope; also use what is
known as pencil carbon paper, so that the merest touch will give
an impression. Cut this carbon paper into pieces that will just
fit inside of the envelope. Place these pieces in envelopes, with
the carbon side towards the back of the envelope, and just a
touch of glue to hold the carbon in place. Now place in the
envelope back of the carbon, a sheet of rather stiff white paper.
This should be of a soft surface, so that it will readily take a
carbon impression. Now seal just the merest tip of the envelopes.
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q” 105
Arrange the envelopes as follows:
Take a thin sheet of paper, the same size as the envelopes,
and place it on top of the prepared envelope. Then place under
the prepared envelope an envelope that is not prepared. This
makes a set. Arrange two or three of these sets, one on top of
the other, and place them in the right-hand inside coat pocket.
Also have in the coat pocket a hard, sharp-pointed pencil. You
are now ready to shoot.
Ask the subject to be kind enough to think very intently
of two or three questions that he is dubious about and would
like to have answered. Grasp his hand a moment, and say: “You
do not concentrate correctly. Here, I will use another method.”
You then reach in the pocket, and take out the prepared packet,
saying, “Here is a slip of paper and envelope; kindly write your
name at the top, and then your question underneath.” You hand
him the slip of paper and prepared envelope. As this is done
with your right hand, you say, “Take this in your left hand, hold
it as I show you, so that no one can see what you write.” As
this is said you illustrate how same is to be held, by placing them
in position against the palm of the left hand, but holding them
with the right hand while’so doing. The performer then says,
“Hold your hand this way, so that no one can see what you are
writing.” Then see that the subject takes them in the proper
position before writing. You then say, “Write plainly, and when
you are finished, please double the pdper in half.” The per­
former appears not to watch the subject while writing, but in
reality he watches closely enough to see that all conditions are
complied with.
Now here is where the skill of the performer comes in, as
he must have confidence enough in himself to act with perfect
composure and self-assurance, and a subject of the proper tem­
perament will be in earnest, and try to follow out the instruc­
tions, if the medium acts serious enough.
The subject, of course, has no idea of what the medium in­
tends to do. As soon as the writing is completed, subject doubles
the paper in half, and performer reaches for the envelope with
his right hand. This taking of the envelope is done as a matter
of course, because the subject does not yet know what is to fol­
low, and he is busy folding the paper and listening to instruc­
tions as to how the paper is to be folded. Subject unconsciously
thinks the performer is aiding in the matter, so that in a few
106 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q"
moments it is doubtful if the subject could tell that the envelope
had been taken away. This continual running talk takes the at­
tention of the subject as well as other spectators who may be
closely watching. However, the other spectators hardly ever
watch the subject closely, for the reason announced that no one
must see what is written. Neither the subject nor the spectators
see what is really done.
What actually takes place is this: While directing the man­
ner of folding, and as the envelope is taken from the subject's.
hand, the right hand is brought back to the left, and without
pause of any kind, the prepared envelope with the impression
on same, is put underneath the pack, carrying with the right
hand with the same motion the unprepared envelope from the
top of the pack. An artists use of misdirection is here brought
into play. Performer does not look at hands at all while making
this motion, but is watching the subject entirely as he is folding
the paper. The spectators invariably look where the performer
is looking, if the look at all.
Performer says, “I now desire you to place the question in
this envelope, and seal it up, and ut)der no condition allow any
human being to see what you have written.” The envelope is in
the fingers of. the performer’s right hand, and he hands it to
the subject. As this is the unprepared envelope, everything
has worked fine up to the present time.' Then the subject is in­
structed to place it in his pocket, and retain it.
If it is desired to have more questions answered, simply pass
to others in a similar manner. But as a rule this weakens the
effect, as so much time is taken up with the preparation.
The subject is now requested to close his eyes, and picture
in his mind’s eye a number from one to ten. The performer says,
“I will see if it is not possible to write this number,” and boldly
turns the packet over in the left hand, leaving the prepared en­
velope upon which the subject has written, uppermost. Per­
former reaches two fingers of his right hand, which should also
contain pencil, into the envelope, removes the paper from be­
hind the carbon paper, reverses it, and places it upon the packet
still held in his left hand. He holds it in front of him, and with
his right hand pretends to write, very slowly. But in reality he
is reading the name of the subject, and the questions written.
He then says, “I get the number seven.” If this is the number
the subject was thinking of, the performer says it will be a very
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q" 107
simple matter for him to answer his questions, and grasps the
subject’s hand, and proceeds to do so, which is very wonderful,
considering the fact that the subject of course believes he has
never seen the questions. In case the subject would say that this
was not the number thought of, the performer or medium, says:
“Too bad, I will have to get in closer rapport with you. Allow
me to take your hands.” He then answers the questions, giving
names, etc., and it seems that a miracle has been performed.
TELEPATHY AND PROOF BY TELEPHONE
AS COMMUNICATED BY DR. “ q ”
“I was visiting a friend’s house, at a house party, one week­
end, and one evening the discussion came up regarding telepa­
thy, and the projection of thought. I stated that I had had some
very peculiar experiences, and that I had found a number of
friends whom I could immediately place my mind in harmony
with, and that I was perfectly willing to give proof of same. I
asked them all to kindly go into another room, and among them­
selves mentally choose a card, or decide upon a card. They did,
and returned to the room. I then asked them to write same
down, and show it to me. They wrote down the card they had
chosen, which was the seven of spades. I then told them that
I had a friend by the name of Jones, one by the name of Smith,
and another by the name of Johnson, and that they could choose
any one of these friends and call him up by telephone, and with­
out my going near the phone, or speaking one word, that I would
transmit the name of the card they had chosen. They decided
upon Mr. Smith, so I gave them Mr. Smith’s phone number, and
told them to call up Mr. D. G. Smith and ask him the name of
the card I was projecting to him. He immediately answered
that he could visibly see me projecting the seven spot of spades.
We tried the experiment several times with other friends, and
they immediately answered back over the phone the name of
the card that was chosen by my friends. At a later party, we
even went so far as to choose a friend of mine who lived in a
distant city, calling him up by long distance phone, and he im­
mediately answered the correct card that had been chosen. It
was all very mysterious to them, and they' all agreed that I had
given a positive proof of projection of thought, or telepathy.
108 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q"
“Still, it was all a trick, and a very simple one; I carried in
my note book'a list the same as below:
A-l Hearts F-6 K-Jack
B-2 Clubs G-7 L-Queen
C-3 Diamonds H-8 M-King
D-4 Spades 1-9 N-Joker
£-5 J-10
and a dozen different friends of mine carried the same list in
their pocket. The secret of transmitting the name of the card
was all in the initials of the party whom I told them to call up.
My friend Mr. Smith’s real name was Harry H. Smith, but when
I told them to call him up, I told them to call up Mr. D. G. Smith,
and he immediately knew that the D. G. was code, so in looking
in his note book he would see that D, the first initial, always
meant the suit, and consequently D meant spades, and G meant
the seven. So he answered the seven of spades. When they
called up my friend Mr. Jones, his real initials were O. Z., but
the party had chosen the two of dubs, consequently I told them
to call up my friend Mr. B. B. Jones. The first B indicated dubs,
and the second B two, therefore, he answered back that he got
the vision of the two of dubs. This is perhaps one of the most
mysterious little tests, and the most convincing possible to
present, and in the hands of any magician should prove very
effective.”

TRICK IN M IN D READING OR FOR TELLING CARDS TAKEN
Add three to bottom card after cutting pack in same place
where cards were taken from.
Example: Ten of hearts is drawn, pack is cut and seven of
spades is on the bottom; add three to the seven and you have
ten. If heart is on the bottom, club is drawn; if club is on the
bottom, diamond is drawn; if diamond is on the bottom, spade
is drawn; if spade is on the bottom, heart is drawn, etc. The
jack counts as eleven, the queen as twelve and the king as
thirteen. __
CUTTING ANY CARD IN THE PACK
Use the same rule as in locating any card. This gives you
the location from top or bottom. You then separate the pack
enough with the thumb, as near the card as you. can, and peep
at the card; if this is not the card it tells you where it is, and
then simply drop or pick up the number of cards that will bring
you to the card called for.
RAPID COUNTING OR FORETELLING NUMBER OF CARDS HELD IN EACH HAND
Notice the card on the bottom of each pack; if of the same
suit, substract the smaller from the greater, multiply by four,
which gives you the number held in one hand; subtract that
number from fifty-two, and you have the number in the other
hand.
109
110 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q”
Example: Ten of hearts is on one pack, four of hearts on
the other; ten minus four, six; multiplied by four, twenty-four;
fifty-two minus twenty-four, twenty-eight.
Twenty-eight in one hand, twenty-four in the other. In case
they are not of the same suit you must find one that is, which
is easily done. Example: Take the same ten of hearts, as above,
but suppose on the other pack would be the seven of clubs. You
know that by the order in which the cards run there is one of
the same suit every fourth card, consequently you know the four
of hearts is next to the seven of clubs; now simply add the extra
card, or cards, to the pack which it, or they, are on.
HOW TO LOCATE OR FIND ANY CARD NAMED
Use the same method as above in adding, subtracting, and
multiplying. Example: Four of hearts is named; you notice the
bottom card, which is the ten of hearts; ten minus four, six; six
multiplied by four, twenty-four; twenty-four cards from the top.
If the card called for is larger than the one on the bottom, count
from the bottom; if smaller than the bottom card, count from
the top.
HOW TO TELL CARDS IN CENTER OF PACK OR TWENTY-SIXTH
CARD FROM TOP
It is always the same number as the card on bottom, only
opposite suit of same color. Example: Three of diamonds on
bottom, three of hearts in center; three of spades on bottom,
three of clubs in center, etc.
A MIRACLE IN MODERN SEERSHIP
Of the many countless methods which have been devised by
which it is possible to gain secret knowledge of what a person
writes, the one which has stood the test of years and which still
remains foremost with many of the most noted public demon­
strators of so-called clairvoyance and mind reading, is the carbon
impression pad.
It'is not our purpose to go into details regarding this system
or the manner of its applied uses, but merely mention the fact
in order to more clearly bring out one important feature, which
is as follows: to eliminate the suspicion toward any apparatus
used it must be in strict keeping with modern business methods
and naturally “commonplace.”
The item which we shall describe, and which we have per­
fected and tested under the most exacting circumstances, has
proven beyond question its vast superiority and unlimited pos­
sibilities as a modern master appliance in this particular held of
mystery.
The illustration on the next page will explain itself from a
mechanical, standpoint, and but a few words are needed relating
to its construction. The ordinary “office” or “billing file” is an
article in common daily use, and we take pleasure in offering
to the magical fraternity this new and practical accessory as
applied to mystery accomplishments.
These file clip boards may be purchased at any stationery
store, but the metal clip alone can also be obtained, and this is
all that is required, as the board has to be made up in a very
special manner. It is not known to the average person that it is
possible to buy a certain grade of paper at almost any wall­
paper store that is made to perfectly resemble several different
grained and finished woods, such as walnut, oak, mahogany, etc.
We suggest oak as being the most desirable for this purpose.
Make a strong frame of wood of the required size for your
file board, the margins of frame being about five-sixteenths by
one inch in size, excepting at the top where the clip is attached,
and which should be about a two-inch margin. The inside of
this frame must have a slight rabbet all the way around, and the
center opening is fitted with a rabbeted panel which is attached
wijth invisible hinges at uppermost end. This should fit easily,
bu&still very closely, the rabbeted edges keeping it flush with
e teffie surfaces of frame.
' ' ill
112 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q”
The upper edge of board has a screw-eye inserted, appar­
ently for the purpose of hanging the board up by, but this screw-
eye really forms the secret lock which holds panel securely in
place until same is firmly fixed, and which for safety is double
locked, by means of the sliding plate attached to edge of board
through which the screw-eye emerges. (See drawing.)
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q” 113
A piece of oak-grained paper is then glued tight over the
entire top surface of frame, and if it is slightly dampened when
gluing on it will dry out tight like a drumhead. The back side
of frame must also be covered with oak paper, but the hinged
panel is covered instead with a colored paper label, and the out­
side edges of this label should overlap about one-sixteenth of
an inch all the way around, which will entirely conceal the pres­
ence of the joint where panel opens.
This label should be printed to resemble an advertising label
with word something as follows: "The Acme File Clip Board,
Manufactured by The James Smith Co., Cincinnati, Ohio. For
Sale by All Dealers."
A sheet of sensitive carbon paper should be attached to in­
side of oak paper held in place by a touch of paste at each corner.
A sheet of white paper is also attached likewise to inside of
hinged panel, and with the metal file clip attached to upper end
of board you have the complete apparatus at your disposal. The
hinged panel, by the way, should work freely so that when
opened it will drop down of its own weight. It is also a good
plan to give the entire surface a coat of thin shellac and lightly
rub smooth with very fine steel wool.
OPERATION
It often happens that a performer has occasion to give a
private demonstration to a single person, and by means of the
special file board a wonderful opportunity is available. The
party is invited to write any question desired, and performer
hands out a sheet of paper and pencil for this purpose. Suddenly,
however, performer realizes the unhandy circumstances for
writing, and as a sort of careless after-thought he picks, up file
board, which happens to be handy, and gives same to spectator
to write upon. A few current bills or gas receipts can be in
place under clip at extreme top of board, and this will add a
certain atmosphere of unpreparedness.
While party is writing, the performer goes to mantel or book­
case and gets a crystal ball, which he appears to consult for
information. .Upon observing that party has written what he
desires, he tells him to fold paper and place same in his pocket,
and taking file board from him he carelessly place same on a
small table which is somewhat to the side and slightly to the
rear of where party is sitting. In doing this performer first
releases catch, which leaves secret panel ready to drop when
114 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q"
the proper time arrives, and in no way should any notice be
given the file board. The performer should move about to dif­
ferent parts of the room while he continues to center his entire
attention upon the ball still held in his hand. Finally the per­
former takes a position directly in front of his subject, and
handing him the ball he requests him to gaze and concentrate
his thoughts upon the matter then in mind. It will be remem­
bered that the party is sitting with his back to the table upon
which rests the impression board, and the performer now changes
his position to the left side of party and places fingers of one
hand lightly on his head or shoulder. While assuming this posi­
tion, the performer with his free hand reaches across to table,
and gently lifts bottom edge of board, which action leaves car­
bon impression fully exposed and which he quickly reads.
If careful attention has been duly given to the exact posi­
tion and distance of table, and also the impression board, when
placing on table, the performer can readily gain this desired
information without the least suspicion being given by any
awkward move, and the spectator will not have the slightest
idea that anything has happened out of the ordinary. Of course,
it would not be wise for the performer to begin reading im­
mediately, but he should again take the crystal from party and
take a different position before finally telling spectator what he
apparently discovers through the means of the crystal.
We shall not attempt to describe the innumerable effects
possible with this clever piece of apparatus, but we are con­
vinced that the above description is one of the greatest ideas
for a single-handed effect ever conceived.
FOR AUDIENCE PRESENTATION
Performers doing crystal gazing or reading for public exhi­
bition purposes find this impression board a most valuable ac­
cessory. When used for this purpose we suggest that you have
a supply of blank sheets of paper of the required size, with per­
forations extending the full width of sheet and about one and
a half or two inches apart, for the full length of the sheet.
With one of these sheets underneath the clip of the file board,
it will be seen that same may be passed to different spectators
in succession, and as each one writes their message they tear
it off at the perforated line and retain it themselves. The writ­
ings, of course, are started at the bottom of the board, and as
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q- 115
each slip is torn off, there is no danger of more than one mes­
sage being made in the same place causing a jumble in the im­
pressions. With several prepared in this manner, and having
the perforated sheets attached, a performer can produce a mental
act which will baffle any audience.
In presenting an elaborate act of this sort, the impression
board should not be made the sole feature, but used as one of
several means in obtaining the desired written questions. In
gathering up the written messages, which should be done by
one or two assistants, the impression boards can be exchanged
for ordinary ones which are brought to the stage, while the
ones bearing the impressions are carried back to the dressing
room from where the readings are transmitted to performer
on the stage by means of any of the various systems in general
use.
It is also possible for one of the assistants to steal the im­
pression carbons from the inside of the hie board while col-
collecting same and while passing in some remote part of
theatre, in which case the original boards are carried back to
the stage, where they remain in plain sight at all times.
In operating the single board, the performer will soon find
that he can obtain full knowledge of the writings himself by
holding the board in one hand at the clip end, the board resting
lengthwise along his arm, the hinged panel being allowed to fall
slightly downward along the arm, when a downward glance
will command a full view of the written impressions.

from all sides. Hands appear at the doors “BB”, bells and tam­
bourines are placed in the cabinet and are hung and played and

spring open and out steps a living, breathing human being.
This trick when properly handled is without a doubt one
of the most marvelous and unfathomable illusions in the history
of magic.
SPIRIT PAINTINGS
Of this supposedly supernatural experiment, there are sev­
eral different methods of presentation.
One is to take a common school slate, and rub a piece of
chalk completely over one side. Then sharpen the rubber on
the end of a lead pencil, and trace or draw whatever picture is
desired upon same. This gives a very ghostly effect. Now, to
produce, you cover this picture with a silicate flap that fits the
frame of the slate. You call attention to the fact that the state
is entirely blank. Have two newspapers on the table, lift one
newspaper up, and lay one slate upon the other, calling atten­
tion to the fact that the newspaper you have in your hand is
unprepared. Hold newspaper to you, place slate in same, and
roll up, being very careful not to show the audience the side
the picture is on, because the flap is now reposing on the second
newspaper. So that same will not be seen, you have one side
of the silicate flap covered with newspaper. You then allow the
audience to hold the slate for a few moments, and then remove
the paper, and there is the picture that you have before traced.
Same can be used with a double set of slates, only newspaper
is not pasted on the flap, as the flap reposes in the frame of the
perfectly blank slate.
Another very marvelous method is to have a wooden frame
about twenty-four inches by eighteen inches, carrying a plain
blank canvas. Same is shown front and back, and placed upon
an easel. A light is then placed behind the frame, immediately
in front of a spirit cabinet, to show the spectators that no one
approaches from the rear. Lights are then lowered, and a spirit
picture is seen to materialize on the canvas. The method of
presenting this supposedly supernatural phenomena is to have a
picture already painted on the canvas, which is really unbleached
muslin, using sulphate of iron for blue, nitrate of bismuth for
yellow, sulphate of copper for brown. Have these mixed in a
strong solution, with warm water, and with a brush for each
color paint a portrait or landscape. This, when perfectly dry,
will be quite invisible. But just before presenting the trick,
slightly dampen the muslin. To produce the picture, your as­
sistant in the cabinet plays upon the canvas with an atomizer
a solution of prussiate of potash. The action of the prussiate
of potash on the other chemicals brings out the colors, and pro­
duces the picture.
119
120 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q”
The most marvelous method of all was perhaps first used
by the Bangs Sisters, two celebrated mediums in Chicago, who
made thousands of dollars with this experiment. Same has been
used by numerous mediums since that time, and stage per­
formers as well, and has been improved from time to time, until
today it is one of the most marvelous pieces of apparatus along
these lines ever conceived of. The medium can supposedly
produce the picture of any human being that has ever lived on
earth, any queen, king, potentate, or famous personage, mother,
brother, father, sister, or sweetheart, whether living or dead.
A great deal, of course, depends upon the ingenuity of the
medium presenting the act in being able to get pictures before­
hand of those whom he desires to produce pictures of. The fol­
lowing explanation and working drawings will explain this great
phenomena, even to its most minute detail:
This outfit comprises a large main display frame on floor
stand, which also contains an inner sliding frame, as will be
noticed upon examination. This sliding frame is the main detail
of the effect and upon it depends 'the full success of the experi­
ment, With the outfit are also several pictures mounted on
frames and also several blank canvases, and two metal shelves
covered on both sides with white.paper the same as the frames.
To prepare for the experiment, first make sure that your
sliding apparatus works perfectly free and smooth, and also
that your thread or cord is properly arranged for working by
assistant off stage. During the materialization of the picture it
is necessary that the house lights be turned off, the only light
being one used in the rear of apparatus. Two pictures will be
found sufficient for use in one performance. Have your picture
apparatus in about the center of the stage, with one small table
to the right and one to the left. Have your pictures and blank
canvases stacked up in the following manner:
Have them all on the table, frame side up, the two top ones
being the blank canvases, and the next two the pictures which
you are to produce. Each one is covered with its respective shell
which appears as ordinary blank canvas like the others. The
rest of the stack may also consist of any number of blanks.
You must be prepared to force the names of whatever two
pictures you intend to produce. There are several ways in which
you can proceed in doing so. Possibly the most simple method
is to make use of the well-known changing bag, a piece of ap­
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q” 121
paratus well known for its effective usefulness. Another way
would be to make use of a number of blank cards upon which
are written the various names of the subjects to select from, and
you merely force the desired one as you would do in perform­
ing an ordinary card trick. The most effective method, however,
is to have a number of small envelopes and tiny cards which
are passed to various parties in the audience with the request
that they write the name of any person they desire, living or
dead, friend or distinguished individual.
You are also provided with two extra envelopes already
prepared with card concealed inside, on which is written the
desired name which you intend to produce. These are on bot­
tom of pile of envelopes in your hand, and bn passing out the
plain ones to the audience you retain in your hand the last
three or four, after which you immediately begin to gather up
the ones which have been duly written. Now all you have to
do is to force the two envelopes on top of the pile in.your hand
in the same manner as forcing an ordinary playing card. You
are now ready for the mechanical part of the experiment.
Return to the stage and call attention to the apparatus,
stating that you use a frame similar to what would be found
in any first-class picture store or artist’s studio, but that you
have made one or two improvements. First the light at rear,
which you turn and show, also a small board on top of frame
to keep the light from losing its power upon the apparatus. You
must be sure that the sliding device is close to the front of
frame so that when the two pictures are placed inside they will
both go down together. The tongues of one frame enter the
groove of the apparatus itself, and the other the groove of the
sliding compartment.
Your assistant may be standing near in readiness to operate
the light. Take up one of the blank canvases from the stack
on the table to your left and call attention to the fact that you
have a number of blank canvases, an article well known to
every artist, and being perfectly transparent. As you say this,
hold same in front of frame and your assistant turns on the light
for a moment, so that the spectators may see that same is blank
and transparent. This frame you hand to assistant, who places
same, canvas side down, on table to the right, for a reason which
'will appear later. Proceed in the same manner with the second
blank frame taken from stack on table. Show light through and
’'place canvas side down in front of stack on table to your left.
122 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q”
Now say to audience that possibly they would like to satisfy
themselves that you are using merely blank canvases and that
you desire them to initial them if they choose to do so. Take
up the next frame from stack, which is really one of the pictures
with shell covering same. Hand this to assistant. Then you take
up the next one in the same manner from pile and advance
toward audience, your assistant following close behind. These
two frames you do not really give into the hands of the specta­
tors at all, but merely handle them in a careless manner as if
they were merely plain blanks. Even hold them up to the light
and suggest that they are perfectly transparent, etc.
Advance with your frame to one party and offer him pencil
at same time witK which to mark his initials on wood side of
frame, which you hold out to him for this purpose. After he has
done so, exchange frames with your assistant and proceed again
with the second spectator. Meanwhile your assistant returns to
stage and places his frame face side down on top of the one plain
frame which should have been previously placed on the table
to the right.
Performer now returns to. stage and places his frame on top
of frame in front of stack on left table. Now take up the next
frame from top of stack, which you also show as an ordinary
blank canvas. Then reach with right hand to rear edge of frame,
which contains picture, and lift same with face of picture to the
rear and bring into contact with blank canvas which you hold
in left hand. Call attention to these two blank canvases being
close together, it being an absolute impossibility for anything to
enter between them. Turn to right and in this condition place
them inside of sliding frame, taking care that the real picture
is to the rear and right side up. After frames are entirely in.
you will find it an easy matter with right hand to push back
the sliding compartment from the top by reaching with fingers
on the inside of frame next your body, and same can be pulled
back very readily.
The lights are immediately turned on, after which you place
your hand down between the two canvases, calling attention to
the fact that they can see the shadow of your hand behind the
blank canvases. Place loose board on top of frame to stop light
from ceiling and then retire down off stage. After this your
assistant on the stage very slowly and gradually operates the
cord which brings the picture close up against front canvas, the
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q" 123
effect being as if the picture visibly materialized right before
their very eyes.
Now advance to party in the audience who has card or
envelope corresponding to order in which you produce the pic­
tures, and tear open the envelope, removing the card and read­
ing name of party, which proves to be identical with the picture
produced.
Some performers find it desirable to present this feature of
the experiment previous to producing the real picture, which in
many cases might be deemed desirable. Of course, it may be
that no one in the audience has written the name on the card,
but you deliberately read the one, and looking over the audience
you ask the question, “Who wrote this?” Use your own ability
in being able to catch a reply to your question, and apparently
nodding to some party in one direction or another, with the
words, “Thank you sir,” or "Thank you very kindly,” etc., etc.
Proceed with second picture in the same manner as the first
excepting that by way of variation you can command the pic­
ture to stop when it is about half finished, thus proving that no
mechanical action is employed. At any desired time anyone in
the audience may call when the picture shall proceed to work,
whereupon it starts and finishes materializing. You always call
“LIGHTS” just before you turn on your rear light of apparatus,
and also “LIGHTS” again when the picture is fully developed,
and after which the two frames are removed from the display
frame and exhibited.
A fine effect can be produced by asking an usher to come
forward and take the picture to the box office in order to be
wrapped up for its owner at the close of the performance.
After a little careful study you will find you will be able to
grasp the entire idea of this experiment, as there is nothing
difficult in its accomplishment, the main feature being the per­
former’s ability to work up features to give it the necessary
amount of sensational incidents in its presentation.
Articles need: Picture frame and shadow box described
later; lamp bracket with lamp reflector and lamp cord; an easel
as shown to support frame; a number of frames for blank can­
vases and pictures. One or two metal shells to fit over frames.
124 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q’
LARGE PICTURE FRAME AND SHADOW BOX
To make frame shown at A, figures 1, 2 and 3, seven feet of
moulding, similar to that shown at A, figure 9, is required. Miter
together making a frame eleven and one-half by fourteen and
one-quarter inches inside, and nineteen and one-half by twenty-
two and one-quarter inches outside size. Saw to pattern an
ornamental top piece, BB, figures 1 and 2. Dowell and glue this
to top of frame flush with back and cut a slot or groove at back
five sixteenths of an inch deep by one and one-quarter inches
wide, CCC, figures 1, 2 and 3, from top of ornamental piece to
inside line of picture frame, stopping one-eighth inch from edge
so it will not show from front. This groove is for finger when
loading frame with canvases. Now proceed with the shadow
box.
. Front frame, DD, figures 1 and 3, is of three-quarter inch
stock, having a bottom and side pieces, but open at top. Cut a
groove one-quarter inch wide and one-quarter inch deep on in­
side edges and three-sixteenths of an inch from back as shown.
(This groove is to receive frames with canvas, figure 7.) Bottom
EES, figures 1, 2 and 3, and sides FFF, figures 1, 2 and 3, are of
three-quarter inch stock; groove is cut in sides to receive bot­
tom, GG, figure 1. Rabbet sides at top for top piece, HH, figures
1 ahd 2, and a mortise at back for cross brace, II, figures 1 and
2. Screw bottom and sides together and fasten to frame, DD,
figures 1, 2 and 3. This is in turn screwed to picture frame A as
shown at BB, figure 3. Top board, HH, figures 1 and 2, is made
of half-inch stock and fits loose on top of shadow box and acts
merely to keep light in box when working effect. Cross brace
II, figures 1 and 2, is cut and screwed to back of shadow box to
hold it rigid. Lamp bracket GG, figures 2 and 3, is made of
hardwood sawed to pattern and fits into groove in block JJJ,
figures 1, 2 and 3, which is fastened to bottom of shadow box
by screws. Drill hole in end of bracket to take lamp socket
fitted with nipple or small pipe, which is screwed in. Fasten on
shade and screw lamp in socket, first wiring socket with exten­
sion cord having plug on end to fit standard socket. Screw blocks
KKK, figures 1, 2 and 3, on slides of shadow box to hold frame
and shadow box on easel.
Sliding frame LLL, figures 1, 2, 3 and 6, is made of five-
eights stock. Sides and bottom are grooved to receive frames
with canvases. Top piece is not grooved and is made narrow so
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q1 125
canvas frames will slide in front of it. A finger hold is cut out
of top as shown at AA, figure 6, and is necessary when loading
canvases. Cut groove in center of sides of frame five-sixteenths
of an inch- deep and three-quarters of an inch wide to receive
brass channel BB, figure 6. This channel is fastened to frame
with small screws set in flush and is used to make frame slide
easily. Cut two small bars of hardwood, MMM, figures 1, 2 and
3, of a size to fit freely in brass channel B, figure 6, and about
six and seven-eighths inches long. Screw these to sides of shadow
box as shown at MMM, figures 1, 2 and 3. Bore two small holes
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q”
in sliding frame, figure 6, at CC, for cord, as will be described
later, and slide this frame into shadow box where it should slide
freely from front to back. At points opposite holes CC, figure 6,
in sliding frame, set two bushings or screw eyes in frame' D,
figures 1, 2 and 3—shown NNN, figures 1, 2 and 3—and directly
below these set two bushings in bottom at 00, figures 1 and 2.
These bushings should be made very smooth so cord used to pull
sliding frame will slide easily. Make two small stops of wood
three-eighths by three-eighths by sixteen inches and screw into
back of shadow box at PP, figures 2 and 3, to keep sliding frame
from falling out of shadow box.
EASEL
The easel consists of two uprights, crossbar and two cross
feet. Uprights can be turned or not as desired and are notched
out at top to go over sides of shadow box and are held in place
by stops on sides of shadow box KKK, figures 1, 2 and 3. They
are also notched out at bottom to fit down over feet, which can
be bandsawed to pattern. Crossbar is cut to length and three-
eighths inch bolts are fastened in end and project through feet
and uprights and the whole easel screwed together tight by
thumb nuts as shown.
FRAME FOR CANVAS
Frames for canvases are shown at figure 7. Full size detail
at figure 9. These frames are made of wood five-eighths of an
inch thick, grooved and tenoned at corners to make strong
frames. Glue these up and cut so as to form a tongue on all
edges, as shown, figures 7 and 9. This tongue is made slightly
smaller than grooves in sliding frame, figure 6. Frame D, figures
2 and 3, so these frames can be slipped in easily without stick­
ing. Bevel surfaces of frames slightly as shown at B, figure 9,
so canvases will make good contact when pressed together, and
paint edges a dead black.
p ic t u r e s
Mount pictures desired on these frames, using prints that
when held to a light will show through paper clearly from back,
and also are not stained on back but show perfectly white.
Colored pictures can also be used. Blank frames should be
mounted with water color paper. All paper stretched very tight
on one side of frame and glued down smooth. Several blanks
are needed and several pictures, depending on number to be
purchased.
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q” 127
OPERATION
To prepare for the experiment, first make sure that your
sliding apparatus, or carriage, works perfectly free and smooth.
Use a small quantity of talcum or powdered soapstone when
necessary.
During the materialization of pictures, the house and stage
lights should be turned off, the only light being the one at rear
of apparatus, preferably a 250 W. stereopticon light bulb. Two
pictures will be found ample for one performance and these
covered with the metal fekes, together with several blank can­
vases, are lying stacked on the table, and are exhibited as plain
blank canvases. If desired, performer can take the entire stack
on his arm and go among the audience passing around for in­
spection all excepting the two which are covered with the metal
fekes, but with a little clever showmanship, it will appear that
all pass thorough inspection.
It is a good idea to request the spectators to mark their
initials on the backs of the frames, the real pictures also being
marked while the performer himself holds them, after which
he gathers up the stack on his arm and returning to stage places
them face down on a table close to picture easel.
The' picture or pictures to be produced must of course be
forced, and there are various means of doing this, the most
simple perhaps being in the use of the changing bag, but each
performer will use a method that best suits his fancy.
It is necessary that the performer know the exact position
in the stack of the two pictures that are covered with the fekes.
If producing one picture only, this should be the second from
the top, and if two pictures are to be used, the canvases should
be placed in two piles on the table, the picture being the second
one from the top of each pile.
Now, lifting up the top one with left hand by the front edge
of frame—this move clearly shows to the audience that this is
a blank canvas—with the right hand reach over and lift the
second one, taking hold of the frame at rear edge, and bring the
two face to face in the hands. This move is very simple and
leaves the shell which previously covered picture lying on top of
the remaining blanks, and its presence there is impossible to
notice on account of the black edges.
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q"
The two are then slid down into the carriage from the top
(picture at rear) and the carriage is immediately slid back and
then the light turned on.
The hand may be passed down between the two frames, if
desired, showing shadow.
When ready, the assistant operates the cord very slowly,
causing the picture to gradually appear.
THE DEVIL’S BREATH
AS COMMUNICATED BY DR. “ Q”
EFFECT
Take a common piece of newspaper, hand it to one of the
committee and tell him to roll it up into the shape of a cone.
Then tell him to blow into same as you do, then crush it up
into a ball and place it on a tin tray. Hold it up in front of
you, and as you blow your breath upon it the paper breaks out
into flame.
EXPLANATION
Go to any drug-store and get a piece of phosphorus. Same
will be delivered to you in a bottle of water. Take same home,
dump into a punch bowl full of water and with a knife cut oif
a piece about the size of a pea. Place in a small one-half ounce
vial full of water. Just before you are ready to present this
effect place the vial in your left-hand pocket with a handker­
chief, and secretly remove the cork. Remove the vial from your
pocket under cover of the handkerchief, and in the act of wiping
your nose or mouth dump the contents of the vial into your
mouth. You need have no fear as the saliva in your mouth will
keep the phosphorus from igniting. Now as they roll the paper
into a cone, reach over and blow into same, and as you do blow
the phosphorus from between your wet lips into the cone and
tell them to also blow into same; then quickly crush up the
paper and place it upon a tray. All this must be done in about
thirty seconds as it takes about this length of time for the phos­
phorus to dry and paper to ignite, so you can time your breath­
ing of the “Devil's Breath” upon the paper ball accordingly.
This experiment I personally know of having been per­
formed by several bogus mediums to demonstrate their wonder­
ful power before superstitious and susceptible dupes, but in the
hands of a magician with the proper line of conversation it be­
comes a very effective trick.
Great care should be taken not to swallow the phosphorus.
THE HINDOO NEEDLE TRICK
This act, so I understand from Dr. “Q", was first presented
in this country by Ah Ling, that wonderful necromancer, and
has since been presented by many magicians with a greater or
less degree of success, as their original trick.
Twenty-four needles are placed upon a piece of silk twist,
about three inches apart. A half hitch is taken upon each needle
as it is threaded upon the twist. A knot is also placed in both
ends of the twist. You now take the first needle and wind the
twist around it until you reach the second needle; then wind the
twist around the two of the needles until you come to the third,
and so on, until they are formed into a compact little bundle.
Place these in the mouth under the side of the tongue. Now
call the attention of the audience to a duplicate set of twenty-
four needles. Place the same upon the tongue. The saliva will
hold them together. Then take a piece of twist the same as on
the other needles, knot the ends of same, and place one end in
the mouth, and gradually draw all of the twist into the mouth.
But in reality, with your tongue, you will find it a very easy
matter to roll the twist around the loose needles. After the last
of the twist has been drawn into the mouth, conceal the needles
on the side of the tongue opposite to the side that conceals the
first needles. You can now pretend to gulp them down, and
drink a glass of water. It will in no way affect the needles. You
may then make a sort of wry face, and with the tongue bring
up the packet of needles that were threaded onto the twist, and
with the tip of the tongue shove the knot that is on the end
through lips, grasp this knot with the fingers, and gradually,
holding the lips tight, unroll the twist, and the needles will ap­
pear through the mouth threaded, one at a time, until all have
been removed. Then, in wiping the mouth with a handkerchief,
it is a very easy matter to get rid of the loose needles with the
twist around them. One performer tells me that he does this as
he is taking the drink of water.
A little practice and you will have mastered a very
mysterious experiment. Use a very short needle with a very
large eye, and the larger the silk twist the better.

THE HUMAN MAGNET
This is perhaps one of the most awe-inspring mysteries ever
presented upon the stage. A young lady of less than one hundred
and ten pounds in weight, announces that it is impossible for
anyone to lift her from the the floor when she desires not to be
lifted. She requests the gentleman trying to do so to place his
hands upon her arms. She places her left hand, with thumb
on outer side of the gentleman’s right wrist, and her right hand
inside of his collar, with a slight pressure against the jugular
vein, throwing her right foot forward, and her left shoulder
back, and stiffens her body. It now becomes an impossibility for
her to be lifted. She allows six or seven of the committee to
take a billiard cue, hold it in a perpendicular manner, and she
simply places one hand near the bottom and one hand near
the top, and it is impossible for them to lower it to the floor. Her
left hand shoves the cue forward from her as she steps into the
circle holding the same, and her right hand pulls forward near
the bottom of the cue, thus making it impossible to be shoved
directly to the floor by the committee.
A little iron swing, which is hung by a one-inch rope from
the large nickel-plated pulley attached to the stage ceiling, is
called attention to. The committee from the audience are in­
vited to pull on the other end of the rope, and any one of them
can easily lift her. But when she announces that she will put
into play her magnetic power, no one is able to lift her, and the
swing descends to the floor, dragging the committee off their
feet.
The explanation is simple, and is purely mechanical. A four-
teen-inch ceiling pulley, its upper half concealed by stage border,
is hung below a pair of small pulleys, through which the loop
or rope passes up to a powerful windlass on the gridiron above
the stage. Here the hidden assistant of the performer is stationed,
and it is a simple matter for him, when the signal is given, to
reverse the revolution of the windlass with a geared crank, and
pull the end of the rope held by the committee into the air,
which will allow the girl to descend by gravity.
The pulley block should be strongly guyed to the stage floor
by a small wire cable, which will prevent the strain on the
windlass from carrying it upward, or swaying about.

LEVITATION
AS COMMUNICATED BY DR. “ q ”
During one of my trips to England, I purchased in a round­
about way from John Nevill Maskelyne, of Egyptian Hall, a very
remarkable illusion depicting the power of mind over matter.
I showed this with great success, both in South America and
in Africa.
The same thing, I believe, was also purchased by Mr. Keller
from the same party, and later used by Kellar’s successor, Mr.
Thurston; but I feel safe in skying that from the standpoint of
effect, I got a great deal more out of it than any other performer,
on account of the class of entertainment that I was presenting
to the public, as I impressed it upon them that I was possessed
with a supernatural power which enabled me to perform this
wonderful feat the same as it had been done by the sorcerers of
India, when in reality it is my belief that were I to have pre­
sented it in India, it would have been far more mysterious to
the greatest Indian fakir than to the most enlightened Londoner
or New Yorker.
The effect was to place a lady in a supposedly hypnotic
trance and levitate her body into the air, proving that she
actually floated in mid-air by passing a solid hoop over her. In
reality it was a mechanical trick—nothing more—and the ac­
companying illustrations and diagrams will show how simple
the apparatus really was. All is completely illustrated except
for the back drop, which was of tapestry of a flowered design,
which made the wires, as in illustration “D”, absolutely invisible
to the audience even though the stage was fully lighted. Detail
“A” is the apparatus that was in the gridiron above the stage.
Detail “C” illustrates the metal rack that hung below the grid­
iron, but which was held up by detail “B”, which was two cables
running through pulleys (detail “A”), down between the worm-
geared winch off the stage in the wings. Coupler “F ” was used
to join the two cables “B” and “B” to the main cable that
worked on the winch. Illustrations of the enlarged details should
make all very plain and clear. The lady was placed upon the
couch fitted to the framework, as illustrated on the couch. This
framework was covered with tapestry the same design as the
couch, thus making it invisible from the gallery. The assistant
i ■?fcbe wings turns the crank on the worm-gear winch and raises
t • body in the air, and if you will take close notice of the
134 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q’
gooseneck back of the framework upon which the lady’s body
is resting, you can readily see how easy it is to pass a hoop
entirely over the body. In case this is not clear to you, would
suggest that you cut out a piece of cardboard the framework,
the same as in the illustration, make a hoop out of a hair-pin
and with your left hand hold the cardboard up and with your
right hand pass the hoop over same, as in the illustration.
It is my belief that the secret of my success in presenting
this experiment was due to the fact that I carried several lady
assistants, unknown to the audience, and who remained seated
in the audience, and when I called for any lady to help with
the experiment, explaining tha: I would place her in a hypnotic

trance and cause her body to become as rigid as steel and then
defy the world’s greatest law, the law of gravitation, and cause
her body to float in mid-air at my command, one or the other
of these assistants would step upon the stage. However, several
times during my South American tour I was able to get several
strange ladies from the audience to present this experiment,
and I firmly believe in my own mind, that through my sugges­
tions they themselves knew nothing of the modus operandi in
lifting them before the audience,

THE ASRAH ILLUSION
This effect comprises two very important items, a table and
a wire form. The more care used in the mechanical construction
of these, the more success the illusion will manifest. The table
top is made in box form and the material should be of three-
ply veneer. Screws should be used and all inside corners rein­
forced with angle blocks. The legs are removable and each leg
has a stair-rail bolt imbedded at the proper place and a wing
nut serves to hold it firmly in position at the corner angle.
137
138 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q"
A good set of ball-bearing rollers should also be used in
table legs. The central portion of table top consists of a false
top, composed of "gore” stock, and which can be procured from
any dealer in shoemakers’ supplies. This material, which is a
sort of a rubber cloth, comes in a strip about live inches wide
and these strips of the proper length are sewed together length­
wise, excepting at the center opening, and which should overlap
to allow of easy entrance into the table top. All outside edges
of this rubber panel are securely fastened to the wood of table
top, and when nicely stretched and finished, at a very short
distance the top appears solid.
A profile right angle pattern should be first cut out of heavy
cardboard or thin wood, and this is used as a starting base to
work from. All joints should be nicely soldered and finished
smooth, so that cloth cover will not catch on protruding ends.
From one side of this form must also extend a cradle, or in
other words a counter-balance, and which is really a permanent
part of the form itself.
By referring to the second plan drawing it will be seen that
the lifting mechanism is very simple. The ends of the two cords
are fastened to the frames at “C” and '*£” and are then carried
straight up and through screw-eyes “A” “A” in fly batten, and
then off to side through another screw-eye and down to floor,
from where they go back again to screw-eyes in floor in rear of
table and up to cradle and fastened at points “D” and "F”.
The action of this form is operated by assistant off stage
just behind the wing. To get a correct idea of this arrange­
ment the best way is to first arrange a small model with a few
pieces of wood and string them up, using -a box on floor under
the edge of an ordinary table top.
PRESENTATION
The form rests at the extreme rear edge of the Asrah table,
leaving top dear. The lady assistant is placed under hypnotic
control and placed on table. A cloth of light silk is then put
over, and performer stands at one end and a second assistant
at the other. Under* cover of action in raising sheet to cover
her, lady enters table top through opening in top panel and
assistant at same time pulls down slightly on cords. This will
cause the form to swing forward to same position as that of
where cradle was first placed. Cloth is then spread over form
and the balance carried through as usual, with cloth being finally

The ends of the two cords are fastened to the form at “C”
and "E” and are then carried straight upward and through screw-
eyes “A” “A” and fly batten; and then off to side through an­
other screw-eye, then straight down to floor just back of side
wing, then through screw-eye again, and back along floor corners
of extreme cradle to form, and then straight up to where they
are fastened at points “D" and “E”.
Thus it will be seen that each cord forms a complete circuit
from top of form up and across, down and again back and up­
ward to lower part of form—a sort of counter balance proposi­
tion, so to speak. To get the correct idea of this arrangement,
a good way is to first arrange a small model with a few pieces
of wood and string them up, using a box on floor under edge
of an ordinary table.
The action of the form is operated by assistant off stage just
behind the wing.
It is well to have the two cords which fasten to top of form
angle outwards somewhat as they ascend to fly batten over­
head, as this helps to eliminate any swaying movement of form
as it is slowly being levitated upward from the table. This should
be done very slowly, and the assistant who attends to this de­
tail should be well up in his part. When he is operating the
cords at the side he will find that he is able to keep form in
perfect horizontal position by pulling slightly on one cord and
then the other. This feature is most important.
Previous to time of presentation the form rests at extreme
rear edge of Asrah table, leaving top clear. The lady assistant
is placed under hypnotic control, and placed on table near the
front, but as dose to opening as possible. A doth of light ma­
terial is then put over her by performer and other male assistant,
one standing at each end of table. Under cover of action in rais­
ing doth to cover her, she enters table top through slit opening
in rubber panel, and assistant in wing at same time gently pulls
down on cords which will cause form to swing forward in same
position as that of where lady was first placed.
Cloth is then spread over form, and performer should use
every possible effort to lend the impression that the lady herself
is still under sheet.
Form is then slowly levitated in mid-air, and at the proper
moment, doth is suddenly jerked away, the girl having vanished
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q” 141
entirely. Form is left hanging, but remains absolutely invisible
against the tapestry-figured background. After form has risen
two or three feet above table, the latter should be carelessly
given a push off stage, as though to get it out of the way, after
which the girl is free to make her final appearance from the
front of the house, if performer desires to finish the illusion in
this manner.
PRODUCING A SPOOK
ANOTHER TIGHT SQUEEZE FOR DR. “ q ”
I was presenting my seances in the small city of “S”, and
one day the chief of police informed me that he would be over
on the following evening and that if I was unable to produce
a manifestation for him and his committee he would give me
but a few hours to leave town and be branded as a “fakir.”
These were harsh words and it was up to me to out-think the
minion of the law.
On the following evening when he appeared at my apart­
ment with a committee of six with him, I invited them in and
asked them to thoroughly inspect the walls, see that the win­
dows were locked, also requested them to lock the doors and
seal same, and to inspect the ceiling and the floor. I purposely
had the carpet removed and all of the furniture excepting
eight chairs. These I had placed in a circle in the center of
the room. I seated myself in one of the chairs and requested
the chief to sit next to me and to put his left foot on my right
foot and take my right hand in his left hand, and to also grasp
the hand of the party next to him. I then requested the deputy
on the left of me to hold my left hand in his right and to place
his right foot over my left foot, and with his left hand to grasp
the hand of the party next to him, and so on around, thus
completing a circle around the room, holding me in such a
way that it would be an impossibility for me to move a hand
or a foot without knowing it. I then requested the lights
to be turned out by one in the circle who was not holding me,
and then to immediately regain his place in the circle. I then
suggested that we sing a few hymns to get conditions right,
and if there was a “spook” within a million miles their voices
would certainly have frightened him away. We then sat in
absolute silence for about twenty minutes, and gradually a
light spot appeared near the center of the circle. It gradually
142 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q”
grew larger and larger until a complete fact was visible. To
those sitting on my left it was the face of a skull, and to those
sitting on my right it was the face of a beautiful woman. The
face and the skull remained visible for two or three minutes,
then gradually disintegrated and faded away. All of this time 1
was supposedly in a trance, but not a word was spoken. Im­
mediately after it had faded away, I grunted and shivered a little
and said, “Where am I?” Both the men who were holding me
were trembling and their hands were perspiring as if under a
terrible strain. The chief spoke up and said, “Turn on the
light, and turn it on quick. We are a lot of damn fools; this
man is genuinely possessed of the supernatural, and I fear
we will all be cursed for trying to intimidate him.” They
turned on the lights and swore they had never let loose of my
hands or feet (which they had not), and those on my left
swore they had seen a skull, while those on my right swore
they had seen the face of a beautiful woman, and the argument
was among themselves and not with me, and I was pronounced
genuine by the high minion of the law, and business in the
office flourished for the next few months. I several times re­
quested the chief to sit at different seances that I was giving,
or to allow me to give him a reading, but every time I suggested
it I could note a pallor come over his face and he declined,
as one experience had been a great plenty for him.
Now as to the secret: When the chief informed me that
he was going to demand a test of me, I knew that it was up
to me to figure out something that was a little higher class
than I had been giving the common horde that had been visit­
ing my seances, so in walking down the street the afternoon of
the chief’s engagement I saw a street “fakir” with a bunch of
toy balloons and purchased a dark blue one about twelve inches
in diameter. I then got a little black hollow wooden tube about
a half inch in diameter, glued the open end of the balloon
to the inside of the tube, let it dry and then blew the balloon
up to its full size, and on one side of it I painted with luminous
paint the face of the beautiful girl, and on the other side I
painted a grinning skull. (Luminous paint can be obtained from
any first-class magical dealer and is visible in the dark and
will dry very quickly if a little dryer is added to it. The skull
now being painted on one side and the face on the other, I
whittled the tube a little on the end farthest from the balloon
so I would be able to tell by touch which was the bottom, so
that the faces would be upright in the circle and not cross-wise
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR..“Q' 143
or upside-down. I then placed the tube in my mouth and drew
the balloon back into it, and placed same in my upper vest
pocket, and it now closely resembled a fountain pen. I naturally
figured I would not be searched on account of allowing them
to imprison both my feet and hands, and in this surmise I was
correct. The minute the lights were turned out I bent my head
over until with my lips I was able to reach the tube and draw
same out of my pocket. I then bent my head forward toward
the center of the circle and gradually blew into the tube
until the balloon was inflated, so those on my right could see
the face and those on my left could see the skull. After allow­
ing them to get the chills for a few moments I gradually allowed
the air to escape from the balloon, which gave the effect of the
faces disintegrating, and then by gradually sucking on the tube
I drew the balloon back into the tube, and with a little
maneuvering of the head it was an easy matter to get same
back into my vest pocket again; then a few grunts and groans,
and a wonder had been performed.
THE ORIGINAL DUCK VANISH
SPECIFICATION FOR DUCK VANISH
Outfit consists of one table, one box and one crate for the
ducks. The table is constructed of three-ply veneer, except the
top, which is a frame five-eighths of an inch thick and three
inches wide all around. This frame can be doweled together for
strength. Sheet rubber, which can be obtained from any vulcan­
izing establishment, is stretched on both sides of the frame and
tacked at edges with big-headed tacks. The top now has the
appearance of a solid board. The top of the table is loose, but is
held in place by small dowel pins. Sides and ends of table can
be sawed any design desired, but rather a wide rim is best for
reasons seen later (as per blue print). The corners of the table
are to be glued and nailed together, also reinforced with angle
irons shown at “A”, figures 1 and 2. The box is fastened together
solid except the bottom which is left loose. This box has a door
on the top which hinges up as shown at “AA”, figure 4. Ends,
sides and door are frames doweled together with either wood or
paper panels. The bottom of the box is a solid board with a
hinged trap which swings up as shown at “B”, figure 4. Trap
should have turn buttons, “CC”, figures 3 and 4, to lock down
when handling. Bottom of box is held to top of table by two
small clips in front and back at “BB”, figure 1, and "D”, figure
4. Front clips can be solid, but back clips should turn so bottom
can be lifted off. A black cloth bag is tacked to the underside
of bottom of box, “EE”, figures 1 and 4, just large enough to hold
four ducks. When the ducks are placed in the cloth bag they
cause the sheet rubber on the table to sag, as shown at “FF”,
figures 1 and 4. The crate is made with solid bottom, with sides
and ends made of three-eights inch doweled rods. These rods
are fastened in the top and bottom rail and are placed one and
three-quarters to two inches apart. The top is a wooden frame
which is hinged at the side and has imitation wooden slats which
are made of rubber stretched across it tight enough to hold them
straight. Table, box and crate can be made to take apart by
using loose pin hinges at corners, but if the measurements are
followed exactly as per blue print, it will be found that the box
will go-into the crate and the table will set over the crate, mak­
ing a compact outfit for shipment without the trouble of setting
it up for every performance.
144
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q” 145
The table with the box is brought by the assistant to the
center of the stage. The crate containing four ducks is also
brought close to the table. The assistant or performer now
opens the crate and hands the ducks one at a time to the per­
former, who opens the box and places them down in the cloth
sack. The box is then closed and the assistant removes the bot­
tom containing the cloth bag, and places same on top of the
crate, which on account of the rubber slats falls down perfectly
level, having the appearance of a perfect thin board. The board
made of rubber is then lifted up and both sides shown; the table
is then lifted up and shown to contain nothing.

SAWING A LADY IN TWO
SPECIFICATIONS AND DETAILS
This illustration consists of a pine box, bound with strap
iron, two trestles to support the box, a pair of artificial legs
and a four or five-foot crosscut saw, such as is used to cut heavy
timber.
The box, shown at figures 1, 2 and 3 on page 148 is made
in two sections fastened with screws to center boards, to look
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF D R “Q” 147
like one long box, joints being covered with strap iron. The
following stock is needed for the box, soft pine being the best
material: 4 pieces %x21% inches wide by 21% inches lo n g -
side 4 pieces % x 18 inches wide by 21% inches long—top and
bottom; 2 pieces % x 21% inches wide by 10 inches long, 2 pieces
% x 18 inches wide by 10 inches long —center boards — these
pieces form one set and new set is required for each perform­
ance; 2 pieces % x 21% inches wide by 19% inches long—end
stocks; 4 pieces % x 3 inches wide by 20 inches long—cleats on
stock; 2 pieces % x l8 inches wide by 20 inches long—center
partitions; 1 piece % x 11 inches wide by 18 inches long—sliding
block for artificial legs.
The sides, tops and bottom are nailed together to form
two boxes having no ends. Cut' and bend a band of sheet iron
(BBB, figures 1, 3 and 6) of about 20-gauge and five and one-
half inches wide, around each center partition (AAA, figures
1, 3 and 6), keeping it flush with partition on one side and ex­
tending into boxes about one inch. Screw this iron to center
partitions and boxes so as to form solid ends in box. Bend 14
or 16-gauge strap iron two inches wide around box as shown
at CCC, figures 1, 3 and 6, and rivet to box except at center
blocks (JJJ, figures 1, 3 and 6), which are fastened in place by
screws (DDD, figures 1, 3 and 6). The straps at end of box
are bent to form an angle on sides and bottom of box, but not
on top, which is left open, so end stocks (EE, figures 4 and 6)
will slide into place. These stocks are reinforced with cleats
and have openings cut for neck and legs. A hand-hold is cut at
top so performer can handle easily. Stocks are locked in place
by hasps and padlocks (FFF, figures 1, 2 and 3). A pair of
artificial legs (GG, figure 5), made of wood or papier mache
are fastened to a board (H) by means of a pivot, so legs can
be moved slightly. This board slides in bottom of box and is
held in place by cleats (HH, figures 1 and 3). A stop is placed at
end so board cannot be pulled out too far. Shoes and stockings
to match those worn by assistant are placed on the artificial legs. ,
Center blocks (JJJ, figures 1, 3 and.6) are cut to match
grain used in rest of box, so box will look as if made in one con­
tinuous piece. A groove (K, figure 6) is cut half through each
center block, so saw will follow and not cut into center partitions.
The two sections of box can now be placed together, center
blocks being pressed into grooves formed by iron bands (B,
148 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q"
figure 6) on the inside of the box, and strap iron bands (C,
figure 6) on the outside. Screw center blocks (J, figure 6) to
iron bands with screws (D, figure 6). These blocks are replaced
each performance by new ones, by taking out screws and in­
serting new blocks.
The box can be finished as desired, but is best stained very
dark, as the difference in grain cannot be so easily seen, and it
also makes the box look smaller.

Trestles, which are twenty-four inches long, eighteen inches
high and twenty incnes wide at bottom, are made of wood,
glued and screwed together and well braced as shown (figures
1 and 2). These are bolted to box, as shown (KK, figures 1
and 3), with bolts and thumb nuts. All bolts, rivets, etc., which
project into ends of box where assistant is placed, should be made
as nearly flush as possible.
SECRET CORRESPONDENCE
The best method for the use of the following invisible ink,
is to write between the lines of a regular letter written with
ordinary ink, using a clean quill pen, as this does not scratch
the paper, and thus make it detectible.. Never use blotting
paper, but always allow same to dry by being exposed to the air.
RED: Write with a solution of potassium iodide and sponge
over with a solution of mercury perchloride (the deadly poison
“corrosive sublimate”).
BLACK: Write with a solution of iron sulphate and sponge
uver with a solution of pyrogallic, tannic, or gallic acid; or write
with very dilute sulphuric acid, and apply heat.
YELLOW: Write with solution of mercury perchloride and
sponge over with a weak solution of caustic soda (sodium
hydrate);
or write with plumbic acetate and develop with potassium
iodide, or better, with a weak solution of potassium chromate;
or dissolve equal parts of sulphate of copper and chloride
of ammonia in water. Heat will develop a yellow color which
will disappear on cooling.
BROWN: Write with a solution of copper sulphate and
sponge over with a solution of potassium ferrocyanide.
BLUE: Write with a solution of potassium ferrocyanide,
and sponge over with a dilute solution of iron sulphate;
or write with a solution of copper sulphate and sponge over
with a solution of ammonium hydrate; * . «
or write with a weak solution of cobalt nitrate and apply
heat; on breathing on this writing it will disappear to reappear
when heated.
PALE ROSE: Dissolve oxide of cobalt in acetic acid and
add a little potassium nitrate. Writing done with this ink will
develop a pale rose color when heated, which will disappear on
cooling.
GREEN: Write with a solution of cobalt chloride. Heat
will develop a green color and by simply breathing on the paper
the writing will disappear to reappear when heated.
ADDITIONAL FORMULA BY THE PUBLISHER:
Table of Substances Used in Making Sympathetic Inks.
I. For writing and for bringing out the writing:
Cobalt chloride, heat.
Cobalt acetate and a little saltpeater, heat.
Cobalt chloride and nickel chloride mixed, heat.
Nitric acid, heat.
Sulphuric acid, heat.
Sodium chloride, heat.
Saltpeter, heat.
Copper sulphate and ammonium chloride, heat.
Silver Nitrate, sunlight.
Gold trichloride, sunlight.
Ferric sulphat, infusion of gallnuts or ferrocyanide of
potassium.
Copper sulphate, ferrocyanide of potassium.
Lead vinegar, hydrogen sulphide.
Mercuric nitrate, hydrogen sulphide.
Starch water, tincture of iodine or iodine vapors.
Cobalt nitrate, oxalic acid.
Fowler’s solution, copper nitrate.
Soda lye or sodium carbonate, phenolphthaleine.
A sympathetic ink is one that is invisible when written, but
which can be made visible by some treatment. Common milk
can be used for writing, and exposure to strong heat will scorch
and render the dried milk characters visible. The following inks
are developed by exposure to the action of reagents:
II. Characters written with a weak solution of the soluble
chloride of platinum or iridium become black when the paper is
submitted to mercurial vapor. This ink may be used for marking
linen, as it is indelible.
III. Soluble compounds of antimony wlil become red by
hydrogen sulphide vapor.
IV. Soluble compounds of arsenic and of peroxide of tin
will become yellow by the same vapor.
V. An acid solution of iron chloride is diluted until the
writing is invsisible when dry. This writing has the property of
becoming red by sulphocyanide vapors (arising from the action
of sulphuric acid on potassium culphocyanide in a long-necked
flash), and it disappears, by ammonia, and may alternately be
made to appear and disappear by these two vapors.
VI. Write with a solution of parafine in benzol. When the
solvent has evaporated the .paraffine is invisible, but becomes
visible on being dusted with lampblack or powdered graphite or
smoking over a candle flame.

THE GREAT MAIL BAG ESCAPE
The above illustrates very clearly a very awe-inspiring
experiment presented by many handcuff kings, jail breakers, etc.
The illustration clearly explains the experiment, except for the
fact that the experiment is always made in a cabinet or behind
a screen. This stunt has been used many times by fake mediums
in presenting physical manifestations and materializations, the
medium being securely fastened in the sack in the inside of
the cabinet, the usual materialization or manifestation then tak­
ing place.
When a sack of this kind is used the medium is very seldom
searched for materialization robes or any of the paraphernalia
that he might use in presenting a seance. I know of a woman
who used to conceal from 100 to 200 carnations under her skirt,
have the cabinet thoroughly examined, sack and bolt as well,
and insist upon the sitters bringing their own padlocks. She
would then allow herself to be placed in the sack, locked, etc.,
and the moment the cabinet was closed she would unscrew the
would once more be found securely sealed within same. This
bolt, open the top of the sack and throw the carnations out
over the top of the cabinet, and when the cabinet was opened she
is all very mysterious to those who are not in the “know.”

PACKING BOX ESCAPE MYSTERY
SPECIFICATIONS AND.DETAILS
Upon inspection of the blue print drawing it will at once
be seen that the box is of the most simple construction and will
offer no trouble to even an inexperienced workman. Its size can
be varied to suit special requirements, but we find that the sizes
as given will be found best for average use.
The wood used should be a good grade of-white pine or
spruce and well seasoned. It really makes no difference in which
end of box the secret panel is placed, and if same is properly
made it will be found absolutely impossible to detect its pres­
ence. This panel should fit fairly close, and at the same time
must work free and easy when the screws are .removed.
As shown in the drawing, the secret panel is held secure
by means of two long screws on the inside, one at each end.
These will hold the panel in a firm and substantial manner.
If the box is to be displayed in the lobby or other place
previous to the performance, it may be well to have long screws
on the outside as well, and just before the box is carried on
the stage, the outside long screws must be exchanged for the
short ones.
Use No. 10 long screws and No. 11 short screws, as other­
wise the short screws will turn loose in the same holes and
cannot be removed readily.
When performer gets into the box he has in his pocket a
small electric flashlight, two short screws and a screw driver.
All he has to do is to remove two long screws and insert the
two short ones in the same holes. He then slides back and re­
moves the panel, makes his exit and replaces panel. He then
removes the two short screws on the outside and puts back
the two long screws just removed from the inside. That is all.
A cabinet or screen is of course used to conceal box from
view while the escape is being made.
Many times the handcuff king gives the specifications of
the manner in which he desires the box made to some large
department store’s packing force, who make up the box which
is then placed upon exhibition in the lobby at the theatre for
several days prior to the pulling off of the stunt. At night the
packing case is, of course, taken to the theatre, where the hand­
cuff king has the opportunity of tricking the box, as per illus­
tration, so it is an easy matter to make a quick escape from
same when the real stunt is pulled.
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES O DR. “Q” 153
A box made according to these specifications can be made
knocked down and quickly nailed together in front of an
audience, which is seemingly miraculous. ~
course, must be manufactured first.

THE CHALLENGE HANDCUFF ACT
This act has in its day, in the hands of many notable per­
formers, proved to be one of the greatest drawing cards in the
show business before it became common property, and many
handcuff kings throughout the world have been accredited
by the public as possessing supernatural power, but it, like
many other mysteries, held its mystery simply through its
simplicity. Perhaps it would not be out of place for me, for
the benefit of those who have not had the pleasure of witness­
ing one of these acts, to give an outline of its presentation.
A performer presenting an act of this kind is usually
heralded into a city by some such spectacular billing as:
M R. BLANK,' THE JA IL BREAKER
Who escaped from Sing Sing, will appear at the Opera
House in a limited engagement and challenges all of the
police of the city and the sheriff’s office to bring any reg­
ulation police handcuffs, straight-jackets, insane muffs,
shackles, leg irons, etc., and he will defy them to hold him..
He will not break the irons or damage them in any way
and will guarantee to escape from same within a few seconds
time.
This in itself seems to the uninitiated as an impossibility and
a very broad statement taking in a lot of territory, but there is
one simple little thing that the public does not know, and that
is that the entire civilized world there are less than sixty dif­
ferent styles of handcuffs, leg irons and Oregon boots. Con­
sequently it is only necessary for the performer or handcuffed
king to have secreted in his possession this number of keys. As
all handcuff kings free themselves within a cabinet upon an
openly lighted stage or under a cape, they can readily, with a
little practice, in a few seconds’ time sort out the key that be­
longs to each individual pair of handcuffs. I know that im­
mediately some who are not in the know will say: “Yes, but I
saw him get out of jail; I saw them build a packing case upon
the stage that he escaped from, and I also saw them put hand­
cuffs on him so it was impossible for him to reach the key hole,”
—and a thousand other supposedly supernatural feats, but all of

place of refusing to accept the irons the performer will then
have his stooges, or perhaps real officials, place four or five pair
of handcuffs upon his wrists and two or three pair of leg irons
upon his ankles. He will then request the locksmith to place
one of his handcuffs upon the chain between his wrists and to
secure the other handcuff to the chain connecting the shackles.
This now looks very spectacular, but in reality the performer
has only to remove the regulation shackles from his ankles
and from his wrist and he is free from the pugnacious trick
irons made by the village locksmith, and in place of being
stuck, good showmanship and lots of conversation cover up any
complaints that the locksmith might make and brings lots of
applause in place of humiliation and consternation to the king.
Packing cases are as a rule manufactured by the performer
himself, and furnished to supers or confederates to bring upon
the stage, and are as simple to escape from as is the paper bag,
a stunt that was widely advertised by many handcuff kings
for several years. The paper bag is usually made of heavy fibre
express paper, glued together at the edges with a heavy glue
such as Le Page’s, excepting for about thirty inches on one
side where the paper was first coated with shellac before the
glue was applied, so that when the performer is placed in the
sack and the top ti.ed carefully with many knots and seals,
and then placed in a cabinet out of view of the audience, he
can, with a little pressure, open up the sack at the place where
the shellac was applied, then quickly rub a little emery paper
up and down the seams and apply a quick-drying glue and
reseal the bag, and step out before the audience in the pose of
having presented the supernatural.
There have been many seemingly supernatural experiments
presented along this line, but all of them are simple and are
in reality no more difficult that the handcuff act, which with
full lecture and patter and the sixty keys can be purchased
from any magical dealer for from $25.00 to $75.00. Also several
books on this particular wondrous feat, containing many
illustrations and pointers, can be purchased from practically any
first-class magical dealer for fifty cents each.
SOME EXPERIENCES OF DR. “Q” WHILE PRESENT­
ING HIS HANDCUFF ACT IN CONNECTION WITH
HIS SPIRITUALISTIC SHOW
AS COMMUNICATED TO THE WRITER B1 DR. “ Q”
I was playing the city of L-----, in Kenlucky, and had ad­
vertised in advance to escape from their county jail. My ad­
vance man approached both night and day jailers, the sheriff and
his deputies, and was unable to negotiate for any price the loan
of the duplicate set of keys to the “Housegow”. I was certainly
up against it. I personally went to see the sheriff in his pri­
vate office, and while talking with him he was called out of
the office for a short time. I noticed the twc large keys of the
jail, which opened both the outer and inner doors, lying upon
his desk, so I quickly took a piece of chewing gum, spread
same out thinly upon a playing card I had :n my pocket, and
made an impression of both keys, and then placed the card
carefully back into my pocket. Upon the sheriffs return we
held a short conversation and he once again refused to be made
a party to my publicity stunt, and I informed him that I had
only been trying him out, and made my exit after making an
appointment with him to lock me up in the jail on the fol­
lowing day in front of a lot of reporters from the different
dailies. I immediately went to my room, shellaced the gum,
spread plaster of paris over same and got a m del outline of the
keys. I then made same up from a stock of material that I always
carried with me, and on the following day, in the company of a
number of reporters, appeared at the county jail. The sheriff,
perhaps figuring some “scullduggery” on my part, insisted that
I be stripped and searched by the county physician before
being placed in the jail. This was a poser, but my mind worked
faster than his, and I informed him that I wan perfectly willing
but that I would like a bath towel to cover my nakedness while
entering the jail. A trustee was sent out aid returned with
the towel. I had the two keys palmed in m / right hand and
as the towel was passed to me I placed the keys in the center
of same, folded the towel lengthwise over a chair with the
.^.£eys: in. the fold, then disrobed and was searched. I then
. earefully picked up the towel, bound same around my waist
157
158 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q
with the keys concealed in same. I was then placed in the jail,
after having been stripped and thoroughly searched by the
sheriff, his deputies, the county physician and the reporters.
Immediately upon entering the jail I found that it was im­
possible for me to reach the lock on the inner door as there
was a big plate over same and it only opened from the outside,
but there was a trusty in the corridor cleaning up and I told
him that if he would take the key and open the door that I
would see that he had $10.00 worth of good smoking tobacco
sent to him the following day. He naturally was very pleased
and opened the door for me. I then opened the outer door,
which opened from both sides, and stepped into the outer office
where the awaiting committee was awe-struck and pronounced
me a supernatural, superhuman individual. In dressing, I palmed
the keys back into my pocket and the newspaper reporters gave
me many columns of free publicity, which certainly helped to
swell the box-office receipts.
Another tight squeeze for me was when I was playing the
town of D-----, Texas. I had already stolen a copy of the keys
for a $10.00 note, from the night jailer, and when I appeared
at the jail the following day to present my wonderful escape,
the sheriff insisted upon having me stand in a cell with my
hands up through the grating and then handcuffed over the
grating. This was certainly a poser for me, but once again
the mind responded to the task. He had the handcuffs in his
hand and we started into the cell. I saw that he had an ordinary
pair of Tower irons, but how was I to get the key upon the
top of the grating when my hands were sticking up through
same with no opportunity to get to my pocket. As he opened
the door and stepped into the cell I slipped the key that
would open this particular set of irons into my mouth, and then
slammed the door on my finger, not breaking the bone but
crushing the flesh- until it bled. The sheriff kindly tore his
handkerchief in two and insisted on giving first aid to my injured
finger. I placed the Tower key on the under side of the finger
while he wrapped it up, leaving the key naturally on the end
of my finger so that when my hands were placed up through
the grating and my hands locked on the upper side, I had but
to reach with my right hand, remove the bandage on my finger,
secure the key and unlock the irons, get down from the table,
and with the false keys that I had made, open the cell door,
the corridor door, and the outer door. Once again I was pro­
claimed a world wonder.
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q 159
Again while playing in the town of R----- , New York, I
had a man by the name of C-----state that there was nothing
supernatural to my work. He also stated that he was the
champion lock expert and picker of Europe and the United
States and that there was no handcuff or padlock that he could
not pick in open view of the audience as quickly as I could.
Once again my mind worked rapidly, and it cost him a $1000.00
side bet, and I incidentally collected some $3000.00 of loose
money from the folks who believed in their home champion.
I challenged him for a $1000.00 bet to allow the mayor, the
chief of police and three councilmen to go to the different hard­
ware stores and pick out a dozen different kind of padlocks, lock
them and immediately destroy the keys. I also stipulated that
the locks should be placed upon exhibition for three days in
a glass case under seal of the committee, in one of the store
windows as an advertisement for Saturday night, which was to
be the night that our lock-picking contest should come off.
On the night of the contest the locks were brought in the sealed
case to the theater. We tossed a coin as to who should have
the first choice of the locks. He won and naturally picked an
easy one. We then each drew one until we each had six. I
allowed him a bench upon the stage, a vice and one assistant.
'I took three locks on the forefinger of each hand, stepped into
the cabinet, and in sixty seconds threw out the six locks, opened,
and he had not even made a good start picking the first one of
his six. The audience went wild. I had accomplished the super­
natural, the unbelievable, the impossible. I had simply out-
thought them and this was my secret: In my challenge I stipu­
lated that they destroy all of the keys the minute the locks
were purchased—this was the covering up of the crime that
was about to be committed. While the locks were on display
in the glass case in the store window, I had an assistant of
mine, dressed in rough clothes, go and purchase from the differ­
ent hardware stores twelve padlocks of the same pattern, and I
had these twelve locks open in my coat-tail pocket when I
entered the cabinet, so when I had drawn the six that were
allotted to me, I merely stepped into the cabinet, placed the
closed locks that I had selected in my inner coat pocket an ’
brought out the six like them that were already opened, and
ste ped out before the audience. I certainly felt happy in
-& >g able f® jqure a village locksmith from under-rating or
ryisag *
®bel'ffljjie a showman upon his own stage, and from the
anaauQt af siefe bets that my assistant collected it is my belief
160 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q"
that we certainly cured many a person in the city of R-----
from butting in on another man’s game.
In the city of D-----, Michigan, I had issued a challenge
to any of the police to place a pair of handcuffs upon my
wrists and shackles on my ankles, and I would dive from the
bridge handcuffed and shackled and that I would come up a
free man. It was impossible for me or my manager to fix the
officials who were to handcuff me so that they would use my
irons, which were tricked, in place of their own, and this would
necessitate my having to use a key under water, which was
very difficult. We were on the bridge, myself in a bathing
suit, with 8,000 to 10,000 people jamming the banks and in boats,
and my reputation was certainly at stake. I was afraid, from
the length of the dive, that it would be impossible for me to
stay under water long enough to remove their irons with a key,
as the water was icy cold, and I had not been feeling in the
best of health; but I had an assistant present with a dozen or
more different handcuffs in his pocket, and several pairs of
shackles that were of the same pattern as those held by the
officers, but our irons were tricked so that a sharp jerk would
pull them apart. Just as they were about to place them upon my
wrists I said, “Gentlemen, you realize that what I am about
to undertake is a very dangerous experiment, and if you have
jobbed or tricked these irons in any way, my life’s blood may
be upon your hands.’’ They assured me they had not been
tricked, and my assistant who was standing in the crowd around
me said, “Let me see the irons a moment.” -This privilege was
allowed him and as he turned around in the crowd he exchanged
their irons for mine and the shackles as well, under pretense of
examining same. I then had them place the irons upon me and
without any further hesitation made the dive. In a few seconds
I arose to the surface, free of the handcuffs and the shackles,
allowing the irons to sink to the bottom of the river, and once
again I was acclaimed a supernatural man.
In the city of M-----, Wisconsin, one evening, I unthinkingly
allowed two officers to place irons upon my wrists that had
been tampered with and which the regulation key would not
open. I did not discover this until I had entered the cabinet,
and I told my assistant who was holding the cabinet of my
difficulty. He stepped to the wings, and had another assistant
tell the orchestra to strike up a loud march, while he got under
the stage and sawed a hole through the stage with a keyhole
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. "Q1 161
saw, cut the irons from my wrists, tooks them down into the
dressing room, and brought out two pair of the same pattern
and placed them upon my wrists. I then stepped out of the
cabinet to face the audience with the cuffs still locked. I
demanded to know of the officers whether the locks had been
tampered with and whether they were regulation irons. They
admitted that the locks had been tampered with. I then offered
to bet them $100.00 against their irons, that if they would throw a
coat over my hands that I would remove the irons in less than
two minutes’ time. They accepted the bet and as they threw
the coat over my arms I reached my Angers into my vest
pocket and secured the key that would unlock the irons. 1
opened both pair in less than two minutes’ time, and once
again, through quick, thinking, saved the day.
In the city of N----- , Louisiana, I collected somq $2000.00 in
side bets by having a locksmith make up four pair of special
irons with combination locks on same. Two weeks prior to
my engagement in the city my advertisments were out, and
the public and the officers naturally knew that I was coming.
I had a letter-head printed of a non-existing New York handcuff
Arm, and sent two pair of these irons to the chief of police
and two pair to the sheriff, and told them that since there
were several people in the United States presenting a handcuff
act and escaping from different irons, that we had manufactured
a handcuff iron that was an absolute impossibility for any­
one to escape from, and that I was making them a presest of
these irons to prove that such was the case, with the expecta­
tion of a few orders for irons in the future, and signed the
name of this non-existing handcuff Arm to the letter. Naturally
when I reached the city the sheriff and the chief of police were
ready to bet any sum of money that I was to meet my “Water­
loo.” My assistants made as many side bets as possible, and
when these irons were placed upon me I entered the cabinet
and took as long as possible to escape from them, then came out
of the cabinet with the irons off and told them that they were
the most difficult irons to escape from that I had ever en­
countered and that I never wanted to see another- pair of them.
This slightly eased the sting caused by their loss of side bets,
and the reporters were kind enough to give me many columns
©f firee a •vertos$&g>. and I believe I also educated many of them
in this tovti&rtttt to bet on another fellow’s game.
162 THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q”
I was playing in the city of M-----, Minnesota, and during
my engagement there the sheriff was away on a visit, and the
chief of police would not allow me to attempt the jail break—
sort of a crabbed old fogy who seemed to fear publicity of any
kind; more than likely afraid that I would walk through his
jail as though the bars were of putty. But I needed publicity, so
I announced from the stage that I had escaped from Sing Sing
after being securely locked in a death cell, and that I had also
escaped from practically every penitentiary in the United
States, and that now it had become tiresome to me and that
I craved for something more difficult to accomplish. I stated that
if there was any banker in the city who cared to lock me in the
vault of his bank, I would be more than pleased to prove that it
would be possible for me to escape from same. Mr. M-----,of the
Blank National Bank, was in the audience and accepted my chal­
lenge for the following day at 12 o'clock, so with many reporters
and spectators I visited the bank. I was ushered into a wonderful
Vendome steel vault with a large heavy combination door on
the outside and double steel doors on the inside. There was
also a time lock on the outer door which I requested them to
lock and set for one hour later. They closed and locked the
inner doors with a special key and then closed the main vault
door through the lever and combination and set the time lock.
In thirty-five monutes I shoved the vault door open and walked
out, and was proclaimed a marvel, superhuman, and all the rest
of that kind of bunk that is visited upon a personage who pre­
sents something that is not understood. I looked at the gaping
throng of supposedly intelligent people, and could not help but
wonder if any of them ever took a few minutes by themselves to
do a little thinking. The secret was simplicity itself. When I
entered the vault I had a candle, two small wrenches and a
couple of screwdrivers in my pockets. The moment the doors
were closed I lit the candle and with the screw driver removed
the four screws that held the plate on the lock of the inner
door, shoved up the lever, opened the doors and replaced the
plate. I then removed the back of the vault door, which con­
sisted of sixteen large nuts, removed the plates, placed the
screw driver over the electric connection of the time lock, and
with the other screw driver removed the plate on the box
containing the combination discs, lined them up, threw back
the bolts, replaced the plate, took the screw driver off of the
time lock connection, put the heavy plate back'on the back
THE LIFE AND MYSTERIES OF DR. “Q” 163
of the door, replaced the nuts, put the tools back in my pocket,
wiped the perspiration from my face, blew out the candle and
shoved the door outward to fame and publicity, wondering all
the while if the public ever stopped to think that vaults were
manufactured to keep people from getting into them and not
out of them.
ADVERTISING SCHEME EXTRAORDINARY
The* advertisement on the next page was used by a band
of high-class fakirs in separating the gullible public from hun­
dreds and thousands of dollars. It was printed upon thousands
of cards and in the newspapers so that the public might read.
However, the advertisement in itself is simply a trick, be­
cause in reading same carefully you will notice in the first part
of the sworn statement that it only states that no charge will be
made if he does not faithfully fulfill his word, and it is not
mentioned in the sworn statement that he positively CAN fulfill
his word. Also in that part of the sworn statement which reads
as follows: “I also promise to give never-failing advice to those
who are desirous of making speedy money in investments, and
for this advice I am willing to wait six months for my small
fee, until after your investments are paying a handsome profit,”
is the part that fools the dupe, because the medium who runs
this kind of an advertisement always has a confederate in the
same city selling worthless stock. When the dupe calls upon
the medium he is told his name, age and occupation, etc., by any
one of the numerous trick methods explained in this book. He
is also told that there are great riches ahead of him and that
opportunity always knocks once on every man’s door. The
medium, of course, is able to see that opportunity is about to
knock at the door of the dupe, because he tells him that he can
see where in a few days a man will call upon him, desirous of
selling him certain stock, and that he should put every dollar
that he possibly can into this stock, as it is the opportunity for
him to accumulate great wealth. He describes in minute detail
the type of man who will call upon him and tells him to beware
of any others that might call, unless they fit this description. He
also tells the dupe that he is positive this will bring him great
wealth, and is so positive of it that he does not want the dupe
to pay him any fee until after this investment has paid from
500 to 1000 per cent. This, of course, seems very honest to the

SPIRIT MEDIUM PSYCHIC PALMIST CLAIRVOYANT
.Never before in the history of occult science has a roan of Shelton's pro­
fessional standing consented to place his services at the disposal of th6 public
for such a nominal consideration, realizing that this city has been overrun
with pretenders, much advertised and self-styled great and near-great palmists
and clairvoyants, and their cheap dap-trap methods. Don't lose confidence In
all, but read carefully Shelton's sworn affidavit
SWORN STATEMENT
I. Prof. SheUon do horoby under oath solemnly swear to mako you no
ehargo If I do not faithfully fulfill ovory word embodied In this sworn
statoment
I tell your name in full, friends,
enemies or rivals; whether husband,
lover, wife or sweetheart is true or
false; how to gain the love of the
one you most desire, or control or
influence the actions of anyone, even
though miles away. I also promise
to give never-falling advice to those
who are desirous of making speedy
money in investments, and for this
advice I am willing to wait six months -
for my small fee, until after your
investments are paying you a hand­
some profit No matter how small
your capital, I am able to help you
to wealth, and I accept no fee until
you are benefited.
I further guarantee and promise to
make you no charge unless you find
me superior to any other clairvoyant
you ever consulted. There is no hope
so fond or wish so great that I can­
not accomplish for you. I guarantee
success where all other clairvoyants
tail. I positively am 160 years in ad­
vance in power and knowledge over
other clairvoyants and mediums who try to imitate my wonderful work. I
give never failing advice unon all matters of life, such as LOVE, COURT­
SHIP. MARRIAGE, DIVORCE, BUSINESS. HEALTH, LAWSUITS, BURIED
TREASURES. SPECULATIONS AND TRANSACTIONS OP ALL KINDS. X
never fall to reunite the separated, cause speedy and happy marriages, over­
come enemies, rivals, lovers* quarrels, evil habits, stumbling blocks, evil in­
fluences and bad luck of all kinds. 1 lift you out of your troubles and sor­
row and start you on the path of happiness and prosperity. There is no heart
' so sad or home so dreary that 1 cannot bring sunshine into it. In fact, no
matter what may be your hope, fear or ambition. 1 do guarantee to tell U
all to you before you utter a word to me, and after I am finished. If you are
not absolutely satisfied, delighted and amazed at my wonderful power, and
if I do not faithfully fulfill every word and claim sworn to above, then you
pay me not one penny: and I do herewith sign my name under legal oath.

Subscribed and sworn to before me this 10th day of August, 1910.

What other clairvoyant ever dared make such a bona fide, ironclad agree­
ment? It is true many so-called clairvoyants moke "pretty promises'* and
give their own personal word, but what good is that? Not worth the paper It
i printed on. Talk and promises are cheap.
If you doubt my ability, call and I will give you positive evidence in
your case free of charge. Unlike the fortune teller and pretender, I ask no
fee In advance and positively refuse to accept remuneration If perfect satis­
faction is not given.

dupe, and when the confederate of the medium calls upon him,
he immediately is willing to invest all of his hard-earned savings
in the worthless stock offered him.
And there are times when medium will go so far as to
give the dupe several thousand dollars of his own money to
invest as well with the fake broker. They will then put the
stock in the safety deposit box together, each one keeping a key
so that one cannot take the stock from the box unless the other
is present. This keeps the dupe from running around showing
the stock certificates to those who might tell him that he had
been swindled, thus causing the arrest of the medium before he
could make his clean-up and get out of the country.
Dr. “Q” once told me of a very peculiar experience he had
while operating along these lines. He and his fake broker con­
federate purchased two hundred thousand shares of stock for
$500.00, in an oil company that had drilled six dry holes and
were supposedly defunct. This stock the Doctor and his con­
federate got rid of to dupes for about $1.00 a share, and six
months later the oil company raised a little more money, drilled
another well on their property, and struck a gusher. The stock
soared to $7.00 a share, making the dupes of the Doctor wealthy;
so the “lobster” was the wise guy after all.
PUBLISHER’S NOTE: It is hoped tha none of the readers of this
book will attempt to follow in the footsteps of "Professor Shelton”, or
other confidence men described in the text. Confidence men, operating
under the guise of clairvoyants and mediums conducted many an un­
savory scheme to separate the gullible public from their hard earned
funds. Law enforcement in days past was lax and these shrewd
operators got away with everything short of murder. Today, for such
practices ,the gates of our penal institutions stand wide open in wel­
come to such unjust and criminal procedures, and justly so.
