L'OR many years we have had repeated
I requests for a little manual con
taming all the prayers given to the Uni-
versal Religious Fellowship, Inc. from
time to time by the Teacher, and issued in
such convenient size that it can be carried
in the pocket or handbag for daily use.
Believing that it contains prayers suit-
able for almost all occasions and for
ilmost every need, we take pleasure in
presenting this little booklet in the con-
fident hope that it will encourage the
development of the devotional or heart-
side of the student's unfoldment in con-
sciousness and realization by making the
prayers more accessible at all times.
In
iv Preface
This booklet is scat out with the bless-
ing of the Hierarchy whence the prayers
were received. And we trust that by its
use the students will be able to tune in
their consciousness to that great reservoir
of light, life, and love, and thereby be
able to respond to the downpouring re-
turn currents which such sincere aspira-
tions invoke.
Fraternally yours,
In His Service,
F. HOMER CtmTiss, M.D.
"Prayer should be understood, nòt as
a mere merhanical recitation of formulas,
but as a mystical evaluation, an absorp-
tion of consciousness in the contemplation
of a principle both permeating and tran-
scending our world. It is incomprehen-
slble'to philoSophers and scientists, and
inaccessible to them; But the simple seem
to feel God as easily as the heat of the
sun or the kindness of a friend."
Man, the Unknown, Carrel, 147.
INTRODUCTION
PTIHE object of all religions is worship
J. of the Divine. And the primary ob-
ject of all worship is personal contact
with and realization of the Divine. But
as there is a method or merhantin by
which the whole manifested universe
comes into physical expression, so is
there a method or merh2nkni by which
conscious contact is made between the
human personality an4 those higher ex-
pressions of God toward which the heart
aspires.
While there are many avenues by which
such contact is made, ranging from con-
tòinplation, meditation, and silent aspira-
tion to the sudden despairing cry for
help and protection in times of crisis,
nevertheless, the avenue most readily
available to the average consciousness is
prayer. This does not mean that one
V
vi Introduction
must necessarily repeat certain stipulated
words as set forth by another, for each
heart can usually formulate its own
words to express its own desires and
needs. But as words both symbolize and
embody definite ideas, when properly
used, words can be used to produce spe-
cific effects.
The prayers contained herein are not
the intellectual compositions of the
Authors, but were given to them already
formulated direct from the higher realms.
They, therefore, constitute definite man-
trams which express definite ideas and
engender definite vibrations whose use is
designed to tune the consciousness of the
user in to the wave-length of definite
states of consciousness and to certain
Hierarchies of Beings in the higher
worlds. Their conscious response wifi do
all that is possible to accomplish the de-
sired results, depending upon the degree
of its reception and correlation.
As we have said elsewhere: "The
repetition of such prayers is like a pro-
jectile fired through the Earth's atmos-
Introduction vii
phere, creating a passage through whkh
the One Life must necessarily flow."
While for certain higher spiritual con-
tacts, it is best to "enter into thy closet,
and when thou hast shut thy door, pray
to thy Father which is in secret," never-
theless, most of these prayers can be
used at almost any time and in almost
any placewhile walking, riding in cars,
etc.wherever your powers of concentra-
tion are sufficient to enable you to repeat
them to yourself with at least some de-
gree of realization of their meaning, and
then to meditate upon them.
Since this is but a compilation of the
prayers themselves, for a full explana-
tion the student is referred to the context
from which they were taken, as indicated
beneath each prayer.
Since this collection includes prayers
suitable to almost every need and almost
every mood, we trust that it will prove
of such practical help that its treasures
will be used in an ever-increasing degree
until many of the prayers are memorized
and so are instantly available at every
time of need.
viii Inroduction
Praying that this little volume will be
the means of stimulating many to make
more regular use of the prayers and
thus experience the manifold blessings and
joys, protection and comfort of the forces
they invok; we send this booklet forth
with our blessing and also that of its
Source.
'Man offers himself to God. He stands
before Him like the canvas before the
painter or the marble before the sculptor.
At the same time, he arks for His gracw,
exposes his leeds and those of his
brothers in suffering. . . . The modest,
the ignorant, the poor are more capable
of this, self-denial than the rich and the
intellectual. When it possesses such char-
acteristics, prayer may set in motion a
strange phenomenon, the miracle."
Mtm, the Unknown, Carrel, 148.

flooding you with its radiance.
See the beam of Light surrounding you
with a circle of brilliant white Light, forming
the Ring-Pass-Not, within which no inliar-
monious or evil thing can penetrate without
being consumed by that Divine Fire.
Then see it illumine your mind, expand
your consciousness and deepen your under-
standing of life, love and law, and the expe-
riences of your daily life.
As the Light surrounds you, see it awaken-
ing within your heart a tiny, bright Flame.
Watch this Flame spring up and grow until
it illumines every fiber of your being with
Divine Love and compassion. Feel the Flame
send an actual glow of warmth throughout
your physical body to the tips of your fingers
and toes, purifying, spiritualizing and trans-
muting the very atoms of your flesh with its
spiritual radio-activity.
Then see it ascend and blend into and
make you one with the Divine Flame that is
pouring down upon you from above.
Then ascend in consciousness Within the col-
umn of this Divine Light to the realms of
Divine Consciousness where you lose yourself
in oneness with the Divine.

Potent Prayers 9
How TO USE ThE HEALING PRAYER.
In the practical use of this prayer,
after repeating it, mention the names or
initials of those whom you desire to have
helped, and visualize their faces as dearly
as .possible. See the Divine Christ-light
streaming down upon and penetrating into
their whole bodies as though from a
powerful searchlight from above. Or
you may visualize them as stepping into
the great pool of Divine Light which has
resulted from your invocation, and see
them submerged in and filled with it. It
is important not to set up your hnm2n
judgment or will as to what the result
shall be. Therefore, do not dempnd
health or any other specific result Allow
the Christ-light to take its own course
and bring about the results that are best
for the Soul's unfoldment and advance
In other words, leave the result to the
Christ and the Divine Law, your attitude
being, "Not my will, but Thine be done"
The Voice of Jut, 345.

PRAYER OF PROTECrION.
0 Christ! Surround and fill us with the
Flame of Divine Love and Wisdom,
That it may purify, illumine and guide
us in all things
May its Spiritual Fire form a ram-
part of
Living Flame around us
To protect us from all harm.
May it radiate to every heart, ccii-
suniing all evil
And intensifying all good.
in the name of the Living Christ!
Amen.
The Message of Aquariaj, 478.
How io USE PRAYER. 017 PROTECrION.
In using The Protecting Invocation,
the pupil must be fully aware that he is
touching a tremendous dynamic force.
Hence, only as we recognize that the
Ring of Fire is the very heart of creative
substance which can create, preserve, or
destroy with equal force, is it safe to
Potent Prayers 11
use it. Remembering this, we must
maintain the reverent attitude of mind
that is willing to take the consequences,
i.e., that we hold a Love so holy that
it will create in us a doser, more inti-
mate and sensitive oneness with Divine
Fire; that it will preserve in us this
sensitiveness and destroy or take from
us all that in us may impede our growth
in godliness. Therefore, we must repeat
this prayer reverently, knowing that care-
lessness may be disastrous. Never re-
peat it unthinkingly or carelessly. The
Message of Aquaria, 155.

To BE EFFICIENT.
To be efficient in life's day at school,
a philosophy should be sought which is
so all-inclusive that it explains:
Where we came from,
Why we are here,
What the destiny is to which we are
expected to reach,
What our individual place is in the
whole mighty scheme of the universe,
And how we are to attain it.
The Message of Aquaria, 185.
Potent Prayers 39
TESTS OF TntcHmics.
How do the teachings manifest in the
lives of their followers?
What is their effect on the moral and
social structure of mankind?
What amount of evil, selfishness, sin,
sorrow, suffering and inefficiency have
they eradicated from their students and
from the community?
These are the tests now to be applied.
The Message of Aquaria, 250.
G1tßmimE.
Always express a prayer of gratitude
for all blessings and everything received;
for in occult studies a lack of gratitude
for each step along the Path is one of
the greatest hindrances the student can
develop.
The Masters teach that every help
along the journey, every word spoken or
law interpreted for the advancing Soul,
is like a jewel of great price.
Hence, to accept it and refuse gratitude
of love in return creates a Karma for
the unfolding Soul similar to that created
40 Potent Prawrz
by undeveloped persons through robbery.
The Masters have also conquered the
desire for personal recognition, admira-
tion or even gratitude.
PRAYER io m FORm-COMING.
Come forth, 0 Lord of Life and Love
and Beauty!
Thou who art myself and yet art God!
And manifest. through this body of
mine,
That it may outpicture Thy radiant
perfection,
All that Thou art within.
Even so mnnifest through me, 0 Lord.
Amen.
ADDITION TO GRACE AT MEAI.S, or after
any gift.
We thank Thee our Father for this
manifestation of Thy bounteous supply.
May we use it to Thy glory in Thy serv-
ice.. Amen.
Potent Prayers 41
THANKSGW1NG
The giving of thanks is a natural re-
sponse of the heart in a spontaneous rec-
ognition of benefits received from life
and Nature and their Giver. It is an
instinctive expression of gratitude toward
the person or source whence the benefits
came. It is a natural trait of the Soul,
hence should never be neglected or omit-
ted, but should be cultivated by all. For
sincere ihnks giving opens the heart, the
mind and the life generally to the inflow
of God's blessings.
PRAYERS OF THANKSGIVING.
We thank Thee, our heavenly Father,
for our life which comes from Thee.
May it ever remind us of our dependence
upon Thee as its source. May we ever
make the highest and most constructive
use of it, that we may do all things under
Thy guidanci and to Thy glory, and to
the blessing of our fellow men. Amen.
We thank Thee, 0 Father, for the
manifestation of Thy love and beauty

and the bees. We thank Thee for the
love of the dear ones of our family and
relatives, and our close friends. May
we all be blessed with a greater realiza-
tion of Thy love for us all, and may we
radiate it to all we contact. Amen.
We thank Thee for the miracle of rest
and recuperation; for Thy protection dur-
ing sleep; for food and clothing and shel-
ter and for all supply, knowing that all
are loaned us by Thee for our correct
use. Amen.
We thank Thee for the experiences of
life, even for those that test our faith
and try our Souls, that we may learn the
lessons and gain the unfoldment we came
to earth to attain. We thank Thee even
for the little annoyances, that we may
learn patience and poise; for the oppor-
tunities to overcome temptations so that
we may prove our sincerity and honesty;
for the deep joy of triumph over sin.
Amen.
We thank Thee for free-will that we

serve both Thee and our fellow men
through unselfish service and through
kindness in thought, word and deed. We

ing guidance through the Still Small
Voice. Amen.
