an abscess of the antigravity
electrogravitics and zero-point energy
research that I&#39;m aware of
I would feel that recently I just met
Bob Lazar and had a very nice
conversation with him in Las Vegas so I
feel even more confident of his
sincerity and his experience at s4 in
groom Lake area 51 for those are not
aware of it as far as actually south of
very 51 but the important thing is that
from his experience alone the very
convincing picture of very advanced
circular aircraft or circular levitating
craft becomes very apparent and this
advancement in propulsion and
antigravity has not been really
available to the civilian population
virtually at all we know of work done by
Townsend Brown for example which
actually I recently published in
Atlantis Rising magazine and Townsend
Brown specifically proved through his
demonstrations on project Winterhaven
that the possibility of providing a
unidirectional force from charge
separation on a craft specially designed
craft as feasible and importantly it
also cushions the supersonic breaking
effect
electrogravitics by itself is
specifically the propulsion effect
that&#39;s gained by a separating charge on
the edge or the surface of an aircraft
and I use aircraft in a very general way
to mean spacecraft or any other type of
craft the interesting thing is from my
research I also feel that there&#39;s a
Magneto graphics available as well in
fact er dr. Lanning Lee and the latest
Popular Mechanics magazine has that term
used in her research so there&#39;s both
options available for providing gravity
anomalies and this I feel is a very
viable area of research interesting
research that now is being suggested by
Boyd Bushman from the Lockheed he&#39;s
retired from Lockheed and he describes
some of that research that he&#39;s willing
to talk about and of course an
antigravity effect that he&#39;s also
witnessed and measured you&#39;re asking
about the unacknowledged programs and I
first of all would like to describe the
fact that many people feel and including
politicians and senators have been
quoted on TV recently for example the
billion-dollar secret that was aired on
The Learning Channel for two hours they
interviewed I believe it was Senator
Murkowski from the Energy Committee and
he specifically said this was a waste of
taxpayers money to have covert
operations that have developed advanced
technologies in this energy or
propulsion area and then NASA is also
getting tax dollars to do the same thing
all over again the parallel development
he felt was a waste of taxpayers money
I&#39;ve seen other senators say the same
thing in fact that particular senator
requested information from the president
about such covert operations for example
the UFO sightings for decades now have
cited the fact that all these crafts
seem to move in very irregular fast
changing patterns and for any craft to
do a fast changing pattern means
they&#39;re experiencing perhaps tens of G&#39;s
inside the craft if it was a normal
inertia
bearing type of material craft but
what&#39;s obvious is that they do it so
effortlessly and can change directions
so quickly that very likely they&#39;re not
being thrown against the wall of the
craft as it&#39;s changing more likely in
fact from the book that I just read
recently dr. Paul Hill it was a NASA
scientist unconventional flying objects
he describes the fact that as you&#39;re
producing a small anti-gravity force
downward approximately 1 G worth that
the inhabitants occupants of the craft
all they&#39;re experiencing is a forced
downward they can be sitting there very
comfortably eating their lunch or
whatever and meanwhile the craft is
going through all kinds of gyrations and
specifically using that crown downward
force to break and to Bank as well as to
accelerate upwards I believe the state
of the art just from my own personal
opinion of the covert life project
unacknowledged on an aircraft or
spacecraft or circular craft is as bob
lazar describes he describes more than a
dozen different circular craft that are
operational at area 51 he&#39;s seen more
than one tested and hovered I have heard
rumors for example that we have bases on
the Moon and Mars already it&#39;s very
likely we do because when you think of
the fact that if you have a craft that
you can get into and travel very quickly
with no fuel this is an important fact
we now in America realize that we can
only no longer survive an oil
consumption we&#39;re at the point now where
we need an extra 1% every year to
survive my wife and I just completed a
study of the Department of Energy&#39;s
comprehensive national energy strategy
took us almost a year to do the entire
book the interesting thing is that OPEC
is not about to or even capable of
increasing their oil exports they
recently decreased 1.2 percent last year
and that caused all our oil prices to go
haywire so we&#39;re at the point now where
we have to demand free
energy the public doesn&#39;t really
understand what free energy is but I
believe it&#39;s already available through
zero-point energy converters and so at
area 51 for example as for we understand
that there is a possibility fro for this
type of propulsion for this type of
energy conversion so they&#39;re getting
energy and propulsion inside one vehicle
the fascinating thing about zero-point
energy is to just step back and explain
it is that zero-point energy essentially
is the energy that the vacuum possesses
as we go down to a state of zero gas
zero heat and zero pressure so the
conversion of zero-point energy is
probably happening all around us I just
listened to a talk by Tom Bearden
recently it also says that zero-point
energy is constantly being converted I
met another scientist at the Institute
for new energy a month ago that told me
the same thing from his research for
decades of work Martin Marietta and
other places you felt that zero-point
energy was something more appearance and
we know it is real so right now we&#39;re
discovering that there are ways to not
only get heat out of the vacuum how put
off publish a physics review article on
that we can also get energy out of the
vacuum according to his theory and it&#39;s
very possible that we can provide some
kind of force I would say that the
motivation or the motive for the path
novice to be suppressing various types
of energy inventions is certainly
motivated by other government agencies
and other government agencies even for
example the American Physical Society
benefits by certain government grants
think the motive also within the patent
office is to save face so I literally
lost my job at the Patent Office for
trying to educate the public and the
examiners new energy inventions that
could save our planet
that are carbon free and feuless when we
particularly look at the next 20 years
we&#39;re relying upon the import and usage
of about 20 million gallons 20 million
20 million barrels of oil per day and we
imported about half of that from OPEC
we&#39;re unfortunately in the very strongly
dependent mode of thinking that that
flow of oil which is a huge amount of
oil is Infinite and will continue to
flow indefinitely the best experts and I
consulted various books including world
watch Society predicts that around 2010
we&#39;re going to peak in the world
resource availability and then we&#39;ll see
a slow decline well just a few months
ago actually one month ago in September
the OPEC nations got together for the
first time in 25 years and when OPEC got
together they basically didn&#39;t respond
to either the United States or the
European nation demand for increased
output instead they basically said we&#39;ll
supply a steady output at a fair price
and so I believe is happening and I
suppose there are other critics as well
that will analyze the situation knowing
that there is a peak coming up in a
forced decline the best way they can
profit since they hold two-thirds of the
world&#39;s oil reserves is to essentially
cut back a 1% like they did last year
now instead of later and by doing that
they force prices up artificially high
and essentially get it ready for being
weaned off of this biological fluid and
and when we realize what we&#39;re doing to
the atmosphere as well by being
dependent upon this dead fossil remains
from their ancient history that net were
forcing that carbon up into the
atmosphere
our carbon dioxide levels have now
surpassed 300 parts per billion for the
first time in four hundred thousand
years and that&#39;s been verified by work
at the National atmospheric centers so
what we realize is that we&#39;re also now
importing into the atmosphere a highly
potent greenhouse gas that is scheduled
to double within about 50 years our
energy consumption demand and has to
have 20
more within 20 years we don&#39;t know where
that&#39;s going to come from and if we
expect that OPEC is going to provide it
wouldn&#39;t be sadly mistaken and I believe
that a war for oil is scheduled in our
given or near future
especially when a presidential candidate
says we&#39;re going to be a hardliner
against OPEC to demand more Oh who are
we to demand from somebody who controls
the market so I think essentially that
our human race to survive has to have
free energy we&#39;re at a collision course
right now our economy cannot expect to
expand propulsion industry firecrackers
going up in the air descend a little 1%
of our base of payload to to a near
Earth orbit is a huge waste of money I
feel very strongly that free energy and
anti-gravity are very imminent and that
there are a lot of inventors that have
put together the basis for this type of
new energy future and it&#39;s just a matter
of us getting invested together and
doing the work so we have a very good
future to look forward to but it
involves new thinking and getting rid of
the old meter JPMorgan mentality where
we have to pay for our energy
consistently meant after month in jail
and after gallery Sakharov and the
number of people that were working on it
I think are very very convincing
arguments that the fabric of space is
like an ocean and energy ocean in which
solid energy is floating on it and solid
energy is the mass and if that&#39;s true
then gravity ways of exists and in fact
everything goes back to heavy sides
equations and it&#39;s waves not particles
