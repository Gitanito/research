L 1263 CASE.
An Apparition of the Living.
The foUomng case of aii apparition of the living has reached
us through Sir Oliver Lodge, to whom the percipient related
her experience in a letter which we print below. By the per-
cipient's request her name and address are withheld, and she
is referred to here as Mrs. Richardson. Her true name and
address are known to the Society. Mrs. Richardson's first letter
to Sir Oliver Lodge was as follows :
—
September 24, 1924.
Will you pardon the liberty 1 am taking in asking you for your
opinion on the following incident ? I know nothing of Spiritualism,
and have no opinions whatever on the subject—for or against
—
but the following incident has made me think.
My half brother (40) and self quarrelled last Saturday, and after-
wards were greatly upset, as such a thing never occurs. At about
7 or 8 o'clock the next morning my brother apparently passed
quickly through my unopened bedroom door across the room, and
disappeared into a corner. I was lying wide awake, so it was no
dream. The door was closed, and he apparently passed through
it without it being opened—glancing sorrowfully at me in bed as
4 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan., io25
he quickly passed—with something in his left hand, and dressed
in a blue flannel suit, with no hat.
I mentioned the matter to him at lunch (when he was wearing
a brown suit), and he told me that he went out about that time
to early service with a prayer book in his hand, atid in his blue
flannel suit, and had been greatly troubled during the night over
our quarrel, which had not been made up, but was not frightfully
serious.
We occupy a large house here, he having one part and myself
the other, but he did not have to pass my bedroom door on going
out to early service.
Will you tell me if it is possible for the spirit of a living
person to appear to another, or to leave the body of that person
whilst he is sleeping ? I was not at all frightened, but a
little startled, when I saw the door had remained closed, and he
apparently came through it. E. M. Richardson.
To this letter Sir Oliver Lodge replied, suggesting that the
apparition Avas due to "a telepathic impression," and asking
whether the percipient would allow her experience to be sent
to the S.P.R. She replied as follows :
—
September 26, 1924.
Thank you so much for your oj^inion on my strange experience.
I quite follow and understand your explanation and agree with it,
although the apparition and facial expression of kindness and
concern was so very real. The only change seemed to be that he
looked stouter than he is, but my explanation of that is that I
had always told him he looked stouter in that blue flannel suit, so
that might have been sub-conscious on my part. Your remark
that " if it is a vivid impression it might produce an auditor^] or
visible hallucination " reminded me of an occasion six years ago
(when I was ill in bed with depression and subconsciously fretting
for my husband, who had gone to Africa), when I distinctly
heard his voice on the bungalow verandah—no actual sentence
or remark did I catch, but just heard his voice. A letter arrived
shortly after, saying on that particular Sunday afternoon he was
talking actually on board ship and remarked that he was certain
something was wrong in his home or with his wife. He was very
anxious all that afternoon. Of course that is only a small instance
Jan., 1925 COtSe 5
of telepathy ; but to those like ourselves, who have never studied
or thought of these things, they are most interesting.
I do not mind my case being sent to the S.P.R. if you would
care to do so, but only anonymously, of course. My brother, who
is well known, would not care for any publicity, although he is
most impressed. E. M. Richardson.
Subsequently, Sir Oliver Lodge sent Mrs. Richardson/ s letters
to the Editor, ]\Irs. Salter, who ^vrote to Mrs. Richardson, put-
ting a few additional questions. These questions, together with
Mrs. Richardson's replies, written on November 6, 1924, are
printed below :
—
(1) You mention that you did not hnow until lunch time that your
brother had gone to early service. Had you any reason to think it
probable that he ivould go : I mean, was it in accordance with n
us ual habit of his ?
Answer. His usual habit was to go at eleven.
(2) Had you any reason to think that if he went out early he
ivould be wearing a blue suit ? Did he usually ivear this suit in the
mornings ?
Answer. Only if going on the river.
Mrs. Salter also enquired whether it would be possible to
obtain from Mrs. Richardson's brother a statement to the efJect
that his mind had been dwelling on the quarrel which had
taken place, and that at about the time of the experience he
had left the house w^earing the suit in which he was seen by
the percipient.
To this question Mrs. Richardson replied in the negative, but
stated in her covering letter to Mrs. Salter :
—
My brother, I know, suffered very much from the time of the
quarrel tiU it was over the next day at lunch. . .
Although it has not been possible to obtain a corroborative
statement from the apparent agent, we think the case is worth
putting on record, as it is a good example of this type of case,
and the percipient put her own experience on record while the
event was still fresh in her mind, only three days after the
apparition. . ^ •

"HEAD-SNAPS." •
We print below a group of communications received from
Members of the Society in which they describe experiences
analogous to the "head-snaps" which were a frequent feature
of Mrs. Piper's trance, just before her return to normal con-
sciousness.
The first of these comnnmications was contained in a letter
written by Miss Dallas to Sir Oliver Lodge, thus :
—
August 17, 1924.
When reading the article by Dr. Alrutz in the July Proceedings
(Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXXIV., p. 170), I recalled an experience I
have sometimes had, and wondered whether it was worth men-
tioning. ... I do not know the physiological cause of this ex-
perience. Of course, it may be quite simple.
I do not very often fall asleep in the day, but when I do, for
a few miuutes, I sometimes am conscious of a curious sensation
in my head just as I awake. It is—or seems to be—a sound like
that of the word shoot—prolonged, and yet not slowly : s h u 1
1
(not shut) seems to give a better equivalent. I have sometimes
remarked that it feels as if a door had been banged just in time !
As if I had only come back just in time, been pushed in and the
door banged behind me! .
-
Of course, I only describe it so to give some notion of the
sensation, not as expressing an opinion. I have wondered whether
it is at all like Mrs. Piper's " click." It is not quite pleasant ; it
is too abrupt to be pleasant. It may be due to change of blood-
pressure on the brain ?
I have not had it for some time now ; whether that is because
I am feeling stronger in health than I did a few years ago, I
cannot say. I never remember to have had this sensation when
awaking from ordinary sleep in the morning. H. A. Dallas.
To this letter Sir Oliver Lodge replied as follows :
—
August 18, 1924.
While reading your letter, the snap in Mrs. Piper's head, during
awaking out of trance, vividly occurred to me—as I saw later it
had to you also. She sometimes had two of these snaps succes-
sively, and each marked a definite, and so to speak discontinuous,
change in the return of her normal self. The return was mainly
Ja.\., 1925 • '
Head-8naps
"
7
gradual, but with these one or two sudden steps or drops, as it
were, into or towards normal consciousness.
I should judge that most likely a physiological explanation can
be given, but whether it is due to the sudden uniting of nerve
centres, or to the breakdown of some inhibitory obstacle, or, as
you say, to a sudden change of blood pressure, I do not know.
And it could not be a thing easy to make experiments on. I
imagine it might be described as the restoration of the normal
connexions to the conscious part of the brain ; and the suddenness
does not seem to me so much like a change of blood pressure as
to a closing of a gap in the nerves or nerve centres, which in the
trance state may be slightly dislocated, using the term " disloca-
tion " in an exact sense. Mrs. Piper expected us to hear the
snap. 1 am not aware that anyone ever did. But I think it is
more than a subjective sensation ; I think there must be a physical
-cause for it. . . . Oliver Lodge.
We have also received a re]3ort of a similar experience from
jVIiss Kelly, who writes thus : — ^
.
'
'
August 17, 1924.
In reading the July issue of the Proceedings, Part XCL, I have
been much interested in the paper by Dr. Alrutz, and would like
to tell him that I have myself frequently experienced Mrs. Piper's
" Head-snaps " !
I am not a trance-medium, and am aware of my surroimdiugs,
«ven when " under control."
I cannot at all produce the condition at will, during which I
feel the " click," and I never know when it will come ; but when
it does, it is loud enough, to me, to make me jump, and I feel
other people must hear it ! No one ever does.
I had felt it, and wondered if it was a usual sensation in
mediumship, before I read anything about Mrs. Piper's trances.
From Dr.. Alrutz's remarks it does not seem to be a common experience,
and therefore I think I ought to record my own. I do not get it after
automatic or inspirational writing, nor the use of an ouija board,
but I do after a circle, when I have been under control
"
or when I have felt myself to have been withdrawn from my
body, and not alicays even then. . . .

8 Journal of Society for Psychical ReseavcJi Jan., 1925
We have also received a report of a single similar experience
from Dr. Hereward Carrington, thus :
—
Awjust 22, 1924.
Dr. Sydney Alrutz's discussion of Mrs. Piper's " head-snapping
"
was particularly interesting to me, for the reason that I once (and
only once) experienced the same thing myself. I have given a
brief account of the incident in my Problems of Psychical Research,
English edition, pp. 144-45. This note was appended to the
chapter giving an account of my Piper sittings, in 1908, and it
will be noted that the head -snapping incident occurred at the
end of my own sittings also (v. pp. 122, 143).
With reference to my own experience, one fact of considerable
interest should perhaps be mentioned, which I did not sufficiently
emphasize. At that time, especially, I used to awaken instan-
taneously, and be in immediate possession of all my faculties
—
unlike many persons who " come to themselves " very slowly. On
this particular occasion, however, I felt absolutely dazed upon
waking up, and this condition lasted for several seconds, until my
head " snapped "—when I was instantaneously restored to full
consciousness. Needless to say, I was extremely interested in the
experience, and made note of it at the time. The " snap " seemed
to take place in the very centre of my brain, and though soft
seemed to be distinctly audible to my own ears. I have ever
since that experience been enabled to sympathise with Mrs. Piper
in her amazement that her sitters do not hear the "snap"' too

COKKESPONDENCE.

man, Lieutenant David M'Connel, an apparition of whom at the time of his
death was reported in the Journal, Vol. XIX., p. 76, and again in Mrs.
Sidgwick's paper on " Phantasms of the Living," Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXXII.,
p. 152. Since Lieutenant M'Connel's death, Mr. and Mrs. M'Connel have had
a considerable number of sittings with mediums, at which good evidence has

centres in the ordinary brain, and its application to success of
communication ?
I am a biologist, and, as such, interested in what we may call
the recrudescence of the belief that pre-natal influences can affect
the mentality of the offspring. This premise has been considered
also by psycho-analysts in tracing the reason of " wounds ^'
or
apparent mental obstruction, resulting in morbid conditions in the
adult, to the mental impression received upon the brain of the
mother of the subject during gestation, the announcement of
the cause to the subject having released him from the thraldom
of this brain association. '
.
It is in the use of associations that we get the most satisfactory
communication ; memory persists, and thought continues as the
acting communicating parts of the person passed over; and if the
waves of thought-carrying memories can reach a receiving depot,
as it were, here, in a brain having a corresponding memory, a
path of communication is made where there is no obstruction to
success. It would seem, however, by our own experience that it
IS not necessary to success that the recorder of the seance should
have the memory or association in her mind, but that there must
be a corresponding memory in someone's mind on the earth plane
which can be discovered by controls and used. Memories which
are capable of being put into pictorial form, or words which have
already been uttered or written, are the most easy of communi-
cation.
Names are difficult to obtain, I think because they cannot be
'
pictorialized. But we have had great success with our names. A
lady for whom David was working as one of the controls of her
medium sat with another medium at times, a long distance away,
and this medium gave to the lady descriptions and names of
persons who had already presented themselves without names to
Feda. The lady was a stranger ; she did not know what the
names meant ;
but there seems to have been some association of
place which made it easy for these spirits to give their names,
there being no mental obstruction to their doing so either in the
mind of the medium or the recorder.
Inhibitions are more difficult to understand in relation to the
brain and to the non-success of communications. During the last
year I have had a little grandson to care for ; he was born in
war time; my son's wife kept his coming as a surprise; she had
10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan., 1925
planned a telegram on the event of his birth, announcing the birth
of a son to those most concerned. This idea of hers rather ob-
sessed her. The child was born tongue-tied. He left my home in
England a fine-looking boy of two years ; when I reached Cali-
fornia two years later, I was sad to find that he was small and
delicate, and could only say a few disconnected words. No
Attention had been paid to the tongue, and he had adjusted him-
self to life without talking ; he was very intelligent, knew the parts
of a motor-car as they fitted and the use of tools, and loved
other children and dumb creatures. After the operation there
was still not any attempt to talk ; tools he knew the use of, but
could not name ; but one day I got him a new tool and said,
" This is a gimlet." Immediately he said " gimlet." His little
vocabulary consisted of the following :
—" Babben, his sister ;
Mummy ;
Daddy ; come here, please ; wat's that ; here tis ; wat
for." His sister said she understood a kind of jargon he spoke,
but we could make nothing of it. I feared some mechanical defect
in the organs of speech ; but one day he sat and looked at David's
picture as a little boy and said, " Grannie, he can't get out,"
and then he said, " upstairs to the telephone." The telephone at
his own home was downstairs. One day a friend of mine gave
him a word to say, and he said, I can't say that ; I am tongue-
tied, you know." One day sitting alone he said, " I hate the very
sight of her
'"
; this was something he had heard coming from the
subconscious. If one tried to make him say anything, some
mental obstruction arose and he could not do it ; the little face
-would work, and he would stutter in trying hard to say the word.
What he gave forth of speech had to come without conscious
•effort. He has lately had an operation for adenoids, and I think
it has had the effect of removing in some measure the mental
inhibition ; I hear he is now making sentences for himself. He
asked me " wat for ?
" and I said, " Well, you can talk now, you
inow."
Our experience with mediums has shown us that our conscious
Taind can cause inhibition. In this experience of the child one has
the possible cause of inhibition by the mental attitude of the
TQOther, the unfortunate mechanical defect, the acceptation of the
condition of not being able to talk by the mind, resulting in a
quiescent state, which allows the subconscious only to function
when anything is said, and then the brain storm and inhibition
i
Jan., 1925 Correspondence 11
set up by an attempt to alter the accepted quiescent state when
conscious effort was urged bj another mind.
The mind of the medium is in the quiescent state, the thoughts
of the communicator are being passed over her brain as an in-
strument by means of the power of the control. Any sudden
question or alteration in the direction of the association of thought
calls for conscious effort and sets up a brain storm in the medium,
and causes obstruction in the harmonious relation which has been
until this minute existing between four minds : that of the com-
municator, the control, the medium, and the recipient. At first
when communicating with David I did not realize this ; there was
one person I longed to hear of through Feda, but I could get
nothing about him. ]\Iy own mind was in the way. At last I
asked about him. Then Feda got a wrong name—" Ned "
—
which was not the name at all, but when she spoke of Ned after-
wards I always got the right man. David did not correct her as
he had done in the pronunciation of French. I had myself set
up an inhibition by my conscious longing and effort either in the
mind of Feda or that of the medium.
The recipient must be willing to receive what is offered, and to
take leads, but not to insist or assert.
We have found that Feda is aware of a possible inhibition. One
day she came to me while I was sitting with another medium
and said that she and " Mrs. Gladys " (Feda's own name for Mrs.
Leonard) would not be able to give me a good sitting, as someone
had impressed her brain too much. I did not believe this, but it
was very evident at my next sitting, some time after. When David
came through at last by direct voice, he said it had been difficult
to get past Mrs. Leonard's brain, but he made satisfactory ex-
planation. It was no fault of the medium, but only showed a
peculiar sensitiveness causing a contest in the brain, because know-
ledge had been imparted to her in her conscious condition which
might possibly come through when she was in trance. It was
extremely interesting that Feda knew what the result might be of
a few inadvertent words.
- At one of our sittings Feda told me of a man who had come
and sat like an image and got nothing. Why she told me I do
not know, unless perhaps she felt that I might try to tell him
how to receive his messages. I did not know him at all, but had
heard of him ; he had come all the way from South Africa to
12 Jotirnal of Society for Psychical Research Jan., 1925
visit Mrs. Leonard in order to try to take home with him comfort
to a woman's sorrowing heart—but he failed. He attended the
seance and behaved as if he were a stone. The demand of his
conscious mind for evidence set up an inhibition in the brain of
the medium which it was impossible to penetrate. He might just
as well have filled his physical ears with cotton wool ; the evidence
he asked for could not be given, because he did not imderstand
or accept the methods by which the mental associations could be
given to him. I tried to reach him, but he had gone back to
Africa.
Feda has come to me in California with David through a ouija
medium ; she said that she and David had an appointment to-
gether, so could not stay long. She called me " Mrs. David."
This was a name given to me by my husband's people as the wife
of a younger son. It had caused some confusion, because I had
a good deal of public work to do in Queensland, Australia, my
home, and I was better known by my full name ; also the wife of
the Archdeacon was named Mrs. David, and we sometines got
one another's letters. Years afterwards Feda teasingly called me
Mrs. David ; no one in England had done so. It is these little
incidents which make for our belief in survival.

REVIEW.
Toivards The Stars. By H. Dennis Bradley. T. Werner Laurie.
1924. 7s. 6d. .
The author of this book has been peculiarly fortunate in having
received from the outset of his investigations evidence which has
entirely and at once convinced him of the survival by individuals
of bodily death and of the ability of these individuals to com-
municate with the living. •
' •
This conviction is so definite that he is led to adopt towards
those investigators who have been less fortunate a tone which is
somewhat dictatorial or even abusive, and they are likely on that
account to feel rather repelled by his writings and to under-
estimate the importance of the evidence which he brings forward.
What is of most interest to English investigators is his account
of his numerous sittings with the American medium, George
Valiantine, who has not up to the present been very much heard
Jan., 1925 Review 13
of in this country. Valiantine is what is known among spiritualists
as a " direct voice " medium. That is to say, it is claimed that
through his mediumship discarnate spirits are enabled to materialize
the vocal organs which are necessary to enable them to carry
on direct conversations with the sitters, and that they in fact
do so without making use of the vocal organs of the medium,
who can sometimes be heard speaking at the same time as the
spirit. In the investigation of such a medium there are evidently
two quite distinct problems involved : one concerned with the
method of production of the voices, and the other with the evi-
dential material provided by what the voices utter ; and Mr.
Bradley wisely decided to concentrate his investigation on the
second of these problems, since this had the more interest for him,
although he is fully convinced that the voices are not proceeding
from the medium's lips. The arguments for and against this belief
may be briefly summarised as follows :
—
For.
(a) The voices are heard proceeding from various parts of the
room remote from the position of the medium and including
the ceiling and the floor.
(b) Mr. Bradley and other sitters claim that the voices are
readily recognizable in tone and expression in a way which
would be impossible to imitate.
ic) The voice of the medium is said to have been heard speaking
at the same time as the " spirit voice."
Against.
(d) In the course of an investigation by the Scientific American
the investigators claimed to shew that the medium was
not occupying his chair at the times when voices were
heard from other parts of the room.
(e) The megaphone or " trumpet," which is usually employed in
these as in other " direct voice " sittings, is stated (but
not by Mr. Bradley) to have been found at the close of a
sitting to be warm near the mouthpiece, as if it had been
held in the hand, and to have contained condensed moisture
inside.
Mr. Bradley's account, however, deals more with the content of
their utterances than with their method, and adds to the literature
of survival a contribution which is of real and permanent value.
14 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan., 192*
His first sitting took place in June 1923 by the invitation of Mr..
De Wyckoff. It is stated that Valiantine was wearing luminous-
wristlets by which he was located throughout the sitting, and in
the course of it Mr. Bradley carried on for fifteen minutes a
conversation with a voice purporting to be that of his sister
Annie who had died ten years before. The important points t&
notice are :
—
{a) The voice was not whispered but fully audible.
(6) Every word was heard by all the others present.
(f) " Her voice on earth was soft and beautifully modulated.
I have never met any woman who spoke in the same odd
way."
" When she [i.e. the voice] addressed me, she said sayings in her
own characteristic manner. Every little peculiarity of in-
tonation was reproduced.""
((/) Mr. Bradley is confident that no one present could know that he
had had a sister who had died ten years previously.
At the second sitting his sister again communicated witli him and
alluded to certain physical phenomena which had occurred in
Mr. Bradley"s presence when he was alone in his bedroom after
the previous sitting, and which he attributed to her agency.
Unfortunately, he does not state whether he had mentioned these
to anyone in the interval, but during this sitting he addressed tO'
her a question regarding her life on earth and received an answer
which he is convinced shewed knowledge of events which were in
fact known only to himself and her. At this sitting too he heard
Valiantine's voice conversing with De Wyckoff at the same moment
as the spirit voice was speaking to him, and an example was
afforded of a further peculiarity of Valiantine's mediumship in a
conversation carried on in Spanish and in a little known South
Spain dialect between De WyckofE's cook and a voice claiming ta
be that of her husband who had died six months previously.
The Spanish conversation was understood and followed by Mr.
De Wyckoff, but it is not clear whether he was able to follow the
dialect.
After these two sittings Mr. Bradley returned to London^ and
as he does not tell us that he maintained any secrecy about his
experiences we must assume that they became more or less
generally known among those interested. They appear to have
been mentioned in the Daily Neivs on soine unspecified date about
,
—^ J o-.>-i .) . 1 ^—s^i—^TT^i T^^T
the end of July 1923, and at about the same time he had an
interview with Mrs. M'Kenzie at the British College.
On August 28th Mr. and Mrs. Bradley had an anonymous sitting
with Mrs. Leonard, and obtained much evidential matter claiming
to be given by the spirit of a Mr. W. A. who had been well
known to both of them. The account is like that of any other
" good " Leonard sitting, but is a little confusing to read because
the communications are recorded as in the words of the communi-
cator though apparently the Feda control actually persisted through-
out. The most remarkable fact recorded is that there seems to
have been a " direct voice utterance of one word, a phenomenon
which has never been previously recorded in connection with
Mrs. Leonard's mediumship.
Mr. Bradley then \asited various other well-known mediums
with rather less satisfactory results. The accounts are mainly of
interest as tending to shew that his previous successes had not,
as so often happens, destroyed his faculty of criticism.
His second Leonard sitting was on November 27, and was
attended as before by Mrs. Bradley. The interest of this sitting
depends mainly on the knowledge claimed by the controls of the
events of the American .sittings. As before, the chief part was
taken by W. A., but " Annie also communicated freely and
described in considerable detail what she had told Mr. Bradley
at the Valiantine sittings. It is cleaj that the evidential value
of these communications depends on how much had become known
in this country of Mr. Bradley s American experiences. He had
returned about five months earlier and had made no secret about
them, and though the second sitting like the first was anonymous
it is difficult to be certain that his identity was unknown, either
consciously or unconsciously, to Mrs. Leonard. This difficulty
rather impairs the value of the evidential matter obtained, which
at this sitting consisted largely of very detailed and accurate
references to what had passed at the Valiantine sittings, the
alleged communicator being now the same sister who had been
recognized by Mr. Bradley at his first experience. There is so
much valuable evidence ofliered in this account that it is impossible
not to feel some regret that there is not rather more detail
available. It would be interesting to know whether the " elderly
gentleman giving the initials M. J. B. was recognized by Mr.
Bradlev, and whether the name of " old A.,'" given in full at the

second sitting, was or was not one of the two names mentioned by
Mrs. Bradley to W. A. during the course of the first, and repre-
sented by blanks in the report on p. 53. Space does not allow
of any further summary of the Leonard sittings, which do not
differ in essentials from the numerous other " good " Leonard
sittings reported by other sitters. Early in 1924 Mr. Bradley
invited Valiantine to his house and held there a series of sittings.
In the course of these he obtained much further evidence of the
same kind as that of the previous Valiantine sittings. A large
number of sitters attended, and many of them seem to have been
satisfied that they were actually conversing with a departed friend.
The most noteworthy phenomena are perhaps the recorded conver-
sations in various foreign languages, including German (Feb. 19),
Welsh (Feb. 27) and Italian (Feb. 28), none of which languages
Valiantine is believed to know. These conversations were im-
pressive and convincing to those who took part in them.
Their description will confirm the belief of those who are already
convinced on other grounds of the possibility of such communi-
cations, but they do not appear to go further to satisfy the
sceptical reader than do the records of other investigators, with
the possible exception of the recorded conversations in foreign
languages. There is practically nothing communicated which was
not known to the sitter at the time the communication was made.
The third part of the book deals with a series of scripts obtained
through automatic writing by Mrs. Travers Smith. They were
written mostly in answer to questions propounded by Mr. Bradley
on various philosophical and ethical topics, and are necessarily
non-evidential, since it is not possible to judge the correctness of
the replies given.
The main interest of Mr. Bradley's work is the degree of corre-
spondence which can be shewn to exist between the Valiantine
and Leonard communications, and it is to be hoped that he may
be able in the future to investigate more fully the relations between
these two groups of controls. y j Woolley

A RECENT NEWSPAPER TEST
By the Rev. C. Drayton Thomas
The S.P.R. Journal for May 1921, published an account of
experiments which took the form of forecasts to be verified
in The Times newspa^jer for the day following. The medium
was Mrs. Osborne Leonard, and the asserted communicators
were my father and sister. Although these forecasts have
been superseded by other forms of experiment, they continue
to be given from time to time, avowedly for practice. I here
describe the most recent example transcribed from notes of a
sitting on October 3rd, 1924. This forecast was given at
2.30 p.m. A duplicate copy posted that evening reached Mrs.
Salter next morning, its envelope bearing postmark, " Bromley,
9.30 p.m. 3 Oct. 1924."
Immediately before introducing this newspaper test Feda
(Mrs. Leonard's control) referred to a communicator whom I
had no difficulty in recognising as an old friend and fellow
student in psychical research, who had more than once given
messages of a highly evidential character through Mrs. Leonard
and also through Mr. Vout Peters. There had, however, been
no attempt to give his name, nor had I ever mentioned it in
the presence of any medium. But on this occasion there was
a double reference to the name :
—
(a) I was told that it might be found in my house " stamped
into the outside of a book"; also
—
(b) " He says that, for experiment, he has looked out a test
Feb., 1925 A Recent Neivspaper Test 19
which your father will give for him. Times for to-morrow ;
column two, page one, see this man's two names. One given
correctly, the other is part of his name, yet enough to show that
Ms name is meant by us."
Since the name is required for elucidation of the above I
here make it public for the first time,—Cyril Lockhart Hare.
On reaching home I discovered it stamped deeply into the
soft suede cover of his book published posthumously and
privately some ten years ago. I had of course read the book
and therefore must once have been familiar mth its appear-
ance, although quite unaware at the time of tliis sitting
whether or no the above description was correct.

of page.
From this preliminary we turn to investigate the front page
of The Times for October 4th, 1924. In column one, less than
half way down, appears the name cyril. On a level with
this, in column two, the name hare lies buried in hilaire,
which gives the required letters in correct order. Interpreting
the directions strictly one would have expected to find both.
20 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Feb., 1925
names in the second column. Whether by accident or design
their exact position in the column was not stated ;
yet an
important location mark is found in words connecting the
three following sections of the test,
—" very close to one of
these names " ; "a little lower in the same column " ; "in
conjunction with it."
Thus the next three items, to be correct, must be found
near together and close to the foregoing names Cyril and
Hilaire. We shall find that they do so appear. I now give
the remainder of the tests ; in each instance quoting Feda's
exact words, and adding a note respecting their verification.
" The syllable bar is very close to one of these names."
Below Cyril, and separated only by one line, is Berkshire,
of which, the first syllable contains the sound required. In
taking down this forecast I spelled according to sound, as
experience indicated that Feda would probably fail to give
the letters correctly if asked for them.
" A little lower in the same column he saw name of a place
which you visited while on holiday this year."
Immediately beneath the words Cyril and Berkshire comes
the name wetherbee twice repeated ;
despite its termination
this suggests the Yorkshire town Wetherby, which I visited
more than once while on hohday at Harrogate last July.
" In conjunction with it was seen a name . . . can't get that
(exclaims Feda) ... of a quality to be aimed at and worked for."
The " name of a quality to be aimed at and worked for
"
is found in bold type one inch below Wetherbee, hit on the
reverse of the page. It is the word trustworthy. In my
long experience of these tests there have been sufiiciently
numerous instances of the required word appearing on the
reverse of the designated spot to indicate some cause other
than chance. This is a not unfamihar happening in book
tests, but there the page is already printed, and one may
concede that the operating inteUigence might well find diffi-
culty in discerning upon which side of thin paper certain
words appear, more especially as the books are not open at
the time. In the case of a newspaper not in type at the
Feb., 1925 A Recent Newspaper Test 21
time of the experiment we may suspect still greater difficulties
even though we cannot formulate them mentally.
" Column three, a little above half down, Etta got feeling of
a well-known book which we, you and I, both know well."
The well-known book is perhaps Westward Ho ! for
" Westward," placed between inverted commas, stands four
inches above half-way down colunm three. It occurs in the
line,— shiji ^'Westward" sailing shortly. My sister Etta and
I had been specially interested in Kingsley's Westward Ho
!
when residing in the part of Devon where that story centres.
" Just above it, and close, seemed to be figures or numbers:
which indicated a time when she and father are often with you,
and when you would expect them."
This is striking ;
for, immediately above the word " West-
ward " and but one inch distant, appears a date, the 1st
April. This was the day on which my sister died. Each
year, at my sitting next following the anniversar)^, she speaks
of having spent part of that day with me. It is therefore a
habit of mine to think specially of her and of my father, and
to reahse their presence with me, on that date.
It is signilicant that all the above verifications are found
within a space only six by two inches. Such a collection of
test words mthin a small area has been frequently conspicuous.
" Look for the word door." (Here I inquired for the spelling
of this word.) " Felt like the door of room."
No clue was given to the whereabouts of the word door,
but an advertisement three inches above the foregoing date
mentions the name doreen four times in large type. In the
first syllable of this name we have the sound required, though
not the spelUng expected. The sound dore would have an
attraction for my sister, because dore (without the accentu-
ated E) is one of her names. I have estabhshed to my own
satisfaction that Feda is frequently unable to hear names, or
isolated words, with any degree of certainty ; and that, where
possible, she expects to be helped by being shown, or impressed
by the idea of, some object having a name similar or identical
in sound. In this instance the picture, or impression, of a
22 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Feb., 1925
door would be the only such, assistance which a communicator
could give. Be this as it may, a frequent feature of these
tests has been that spelling is ignored and identity of sound
reUed upon.
An accompanying sketch exhibits the above words in rela-
tive position, together with indication of their place in regard
to the whole page.
Two items were given for page five, but the verification of
these is not sufficiently definite to detain us.
The total result of the experiment shows, as usual, a ming-
ling of accurate and inaccurate ; but it will be conceded that
hits are more numerous than misses. Neither The Times for
the day before October 4th, nor for the day after, afford any
hits whatever. It might be interesting to ascertain what
degree of correspondence could be found between this forecast,
given for October 4th, and any half score of Times for dates
selected at random. This has been done on a previous occa-
sion and the result showed that chance coincidence averaged
less than two successes, as against ten obtained in the experi-
ment through Mrs. Leonard. (See Some New Evidence for
Human Survival, pp. 145-7.)
It may be asked how much of the information revealed
could have been known to Mrs. Leonard normally ? Exactly
the following and no more : —That I had spent my holiday in
Harrogate ; that my sister's death occurred on April 1st
;
that Dore was one of my sister's names ; and that I was
familiar wath the west of England.
It will be perceived at once that, supposing we grant the
medium's possession of these facts, the problem of the news-
paper test remains unchanged. For the problem is this :
—
How came it to pass that these items of information were
successfully j^aired with words which were not yet in type,
but which would by midnight be placed in the designated
positions in the paper and page stated ? The forecast was
given at 2.30 p.m., an hour when no operator of The Times
office would know in what part of the columns the advertise-
ments would finally be placed.
Verifications such as the foregoing are interesting, although
not sensational. Can the result be attributed to normal
Feb., 1925 A Recent Newspaper Test 23
causes ? If not, then the action of a supernormal faculty
produced this forecast. What was the nature of this faculty
and by whom was it exercised ? My communicators have
said that this type of test was devised to show that they
could produce forecasts which ehminated the hypothesis of
telepathy between sitter and medium, since they combine
matter familiar to the sitter with information which could
be known only, if at all, to The Times officials. It is further
claimed that the method employed in forecasting the approxi-
mate whereabouts of names upon a page not yet in type is
an extension of clairvoyant faculty, a viewing of " the shadow
cast before." If the above verifications justify that claim we
are confronted by a phenomenon which may throw some hght
upon those more distant forecasts of which Dr. Eugene Osty
has given examples in his recent book, and of which Prof.
CamiUe Flammarion has recorded many strilring instances. As
Prof. Charles Eichet has recently written :
—
" Among all these perplexing phenomena there is one that is
more perplexing than any others—Prevision. It is established by
proofs that are absolutely certain, but it remains totally incom-
prehensible."
MEMORY.
By F. C. Constable.
It is most important for Psychical Research that when we use
the term " memory " we should have as clear an idea as
possible as to what we mean by the term.
Now in all the discussion that has arisen, I think there has
been an underlying error. Memory has been confounded with
the use of memory.
When we remember anything, what we do is that we think,
in the present passing moment, about something that happened
in the past of our lives. When, in the present, we remember
something that happened in the past, what is it that we do ?
We use, in the present, something already in our minds, what-
ever our " minds " may be. In some way or other this past
must be in our minds or we could not " take it out " to use
it in the present.
24 Journal of Society for PsycJiical Research Feb., 3925
This power in man I define as memory. The use of the
power, that is the use in the present, of the past stored up in
the mind—is the use of memory.
I have, in Personality and Telepathy, worked out at inordin-
ate length a theory of memory. Good, bad or indifferent, I
think it starts on the right line, that is, on the distinction
between memory and the use of memory.
I try now shortly and so, necessarily, dogmatically to state
what the theory is. And, as I know well the dishke in the
west for the abstract, I try to keep as close as is possible to the
concrete.
Consider any man of fifty years of age. From the cradle he
has had personal experience of a series of events. The events
have come and gone in time. But how did the mind of the
man function ivith the events ? It did not function with per-
ceptions or even conceptions. It functioned with ideas of the
events. We do not think a chair, table, or indeed any object.
We think about it. That is, our minds function with ideas of
things, ideas which give us certain information about " things."
When an event has come to an end we can still think " about
it " because an idea of the event remains stored up in the mind.
The events of the man's life have come and gone in time.
But the ideas of the events remain in the man's mind. The
events perish : the ideas still live.^ There is in the man's mind
a storage of ideas of his past human experience. This storage
I define as memory.
In ordinary parlance we say the man has a good, bad or
indifi'erent memory. What do we mean by saying this 1 We
cannot mean that this storage of memory is good, bad or in-
different. What we mean is that his use of the storage is good,
bad or indifferent.
But what do we mean by the use of memory ?
Let the man of fifty be taken to have an indifferently good
memory. He can, then, remember many events that took
1 Bert-rand Russell, referring to the dematerialization of matter by science,
states :
" The whole solidity (of matter) is gone, and with it the character-
istics that, to the materiaUsts, made matter seem more real than fleeting
thoughts." (Cf. Psyche, vol. v. p. 115). Ideas of events outlive events. We
get an inlding of Platonism.
Feb., 1925 Memonj 25
place at difiering periods of Ms lifetime. He can do this
because, though the events themselves have perished in time,
ideas of the events remain stored in his mind. He remembers,
let us say, an event of ten years ago. What does this mean ?
It means that he takes out of his storage of ideas one par-
ticular idea and uses it in relation to himself and his himian
experience, as he exists ten years after the event happened
—
ten years after the event has come to an end. The same is
true for all the events that he can remember.
Now here comes in the contradiction between the expr-essed
opinions of Ricliet and Sir Oliver Lodge. The question I now
consider about which there is dispute is this :
—What is the
mind of man which has this storage of ideas 1 I hold that no
one can deny that the storage exists.
Richet holds that the storage is in the brain of man. Let
us consider this argument.
The brain of man is manifest in our sensible universe, it is
a " subject of consciousness." In Kant's words, it is subject
to time and space, which are the absolutely first formal prin-
ciples of our sensible world. ^ The brain of man is subject to the
changes of time and space. It follows that the contents of the
brain must be subject to the changes of time and space. This
appears to me to be a logical conclusion.
But what is the human experience of the man of fifty years
of age ? All the events of his life have perished in time and
space, the very form of his brain has changed with the changes
of his time and space. And yet the man finds in his mind a
practically changeless storage of ideas. When he takes out of
his storage an idea, the idea is the same as if he had taken
it out when he was, let us say, forty years old. It is true
that relatively to the man when forty it would not have had
the same relative appearance as when he was fiity. But this
comes from no change in the idea itself. It comes because the
man himself, as a living organism of body, brain and thought
(so far as thought is correlated to the motion of the brain)
has changed in time and space. Our universe is one of rela-

tivity, not of the absolute. So wlien the man's outlook changes
the "same thing" takes on a different aspect.^
I think that this permanent content of ideas cannot exist in
a material " thing " like the brain, which is subject, in con-
tinuity, to the changes of time and space. An event of my
own life which happened in 1867, is as clear and definite in
me at the present time as when, over fifty years ago, the idea
first became mine. How could any " j^ermanent thing " be
stereotyped on a changing material object ?
This practically permanent storage of ideas does, I think,
exist. And, if so, what it is stored in must be permanent, that
is, not subject to the changes of time and space. It cannot,
then, be stored up in the brain, which is subject to the changes
of time and space. I think the " mind " that ideas are stored
up in cannot be that changing thing the brain.
If the distinction between memory and the use of memory
be accepted, I think that, logically, we must refer back memory
(the storage of ideas) to a permanent mind in man, and not
to that material thing the brain, which is subject to the
changes of time and space. For there is nothing permanent
about the brain from childhood to old age. It does not, as
time passes, merely accrete the potentiality of motion, accrete
it on something which in its origin is permanent. Its whole
form changes with the changes of time and space. Besides
this, no idea exists in itself. All ideas must be mine or yours
as conditions of their existence. And this means that ideas can
only exist for or in relation to personalities.
The argiiment cannot here be carried further, or we shall be
landed in the metaphysical. All now attempted is to show,
logically, that memory cannot be regarded as dependent on the
existence of the brain.
^ We all regard the same one universe from different points of view. For
each of ns, as personalities, there appears to be a different universe. What-
ever the universe may be, or may not be, it is subjective to each one of us
as human beings.

COEEESPONDENCE.
Concerning Telepathic Communication with Animals.
To the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.
Madam,—I have for a long time held the opinion that Ught
might be thrown on the subject of Telepathy by a careful study
of what appears to be telepathic communication between different
animals ; also by any well authenticated instances of telepathy
between human beings and domesticated animals.
In A Game. Ranger's Note-Book, Mr. A. B. Percival remarks
on simultaneous action on the part of giraffes : I append the
passage in case you think it sufficiently interesting to be worth
inserting.
I myself once received a telepathic imj^ression from a pet cat.
I feel sure these are not isolated incidents.
May I venture therefore to ask my fellow members of S.P.R.
to be so kind as to furnish me with particulars of any instances
of telepathy (a) between dift'erent animals, (6) between animals
and human beings ?
S. M. KiNGSFORD.
EXTRACT FROM A GAME RANGER'S NOTE-BOOK,
By a. Blayney Percival, page 274.
The thing that struck me more than anything else while watching
the giraffe at Sultan Hamud was this : the whole troop would
be scattered over an area of perhaps a couple of acres, feeding
or standing ;
suddenly, with one accord, all would drift away
in the same direction as though in obedience to some signal seen
simultaneously by every eye. Sight, however, was not the sense
to which the command was addressed—if there were a command
—
for many of the animals would be standing in positions whence
they could not see their fellows. Not a sound was heard, but
the unanimity of the movement gave the impression that they
possess some mysterious means of intercommunication. It was
almost uncanny, the singleness of mind with which the great
-creatures aU moved in the same direction.
The giraffe was for long supposed to be incapable of uttering
any sound at all ;
they are extremely silent creatures, and it was not
until I had had a good many years' experience with game in Africa
that I first heard one raise its voice.

II. A Forgotten Memory Eevived in a Dream.
ith September, 1924.
Dear Madam,—The following may interest you.
I possess two heavy hammers, one kept for driving goat-stakes,
one for household use. A few weeks ago I broke the goat-
hammer, and went to fetch the other, but could not find it. I
hunted everywhere likely for it, and had it constantly in mind,
because until the other could be repaired I had to make do with
a light hammer. At last I had what I believed an " inspira-
tional " flash of an idea ; I seemed to recollect that I had last
used it when a neighbour was helping with a job. He moved
away some months ago, and I decided (on this inspiration) that
he had helped himself to my hammer. I can't say I had for-
gotten the matter, because I have never replaced the tool, and
miss it every time I do a job with a hammer too light.
Last night I dreamt I was walking in the long rough grass
near the bee-hives, and saw my hammer, fine and bright, on the
top of the grass.
To-day, some hours after I had risen—about 11 a.m.—I sud-
denly recalled this dream in a " flash vision " induced by stooping
and getting blood to the head. I went to the rough grass, which
is very bad, as I have been unwell and neglecting my hives, and
is never grazed, as I can't let animals down there. With a hoe
and sickle I got some of the rough cut away and beaten down,
and there between two large stones was my hammer ; but not
bright, very rusty, and the haft sodden.
The rough grass is a patch some 2|—3| yards in width, and I
should say 14—18 yards long. The grass and weeds are knee-
high, and matted by being grown through.
I have since recalled that in the early part of the year, before
the bees were working, I put a brood of ducklings in coop out in
that spot to forage for a week or two, and probably had the
hammer to mend the coop some time.
Before sleeping last night I had no thought of the hammer, but
was dee2)ly concerned about a little old pet which is very ill, and
I rose in the night to see her—whether before or after my dream
I don't at all know.

REVIEW.
••(1) Die Stellung der heutigen Wissenschaft zu den pampsychischen
Phdnomenen. By Prof. Karl Camillo Schneider. Pp. 53.
(2) Gesundung durch Erziehtmg, Paedagogische Psycliogymnastik,
Persuasion und Coueismus. By Prof. Dr. Ferdinand Winkler.
Pp. 25.

Fornung Nos. 2-4 of the Vienna Parapsychic Library, and
all published by Johannes Baum, PfulHngen, Wiirttemberg.
(1) Of these three publications of the Vienna Parapsychic Institute,
that of Prof. Schneider of Vienna University, the President of the
Institute, is the longest and most important. It is an ambitious
attempt to determine how and on what assumptions the various'
'
occult '
phenomena, telepathy, telekinesis, dream, madness,
clairvoyance and magic, assuming them to exist, could be ac-
commodated within the scheme of modern science. But the
attempt is too ambitious for the space allowed, and the result
is very tough reading. For Prof. Schneider plunges so deep into
metaphysics that he can extricate himself by nothing short of a
theory of creation, which makes not God (who is '
imprisoned
'
in it) but nothingness the creator of the world, and derives its
origin from " a stupid accident "
(p. 49). The truth is that he
has tried to pack too much into a small space, and has not
room enough to develop his ideas : they are only indicated very
concisely, and much of the argument is left obscure. In particular,
it is not adequately explained how precisely the '
occult ' pheno-
mena support Prof. Schneider's interpretation of their significance.
Philosophically, Prof. Schneider is perhaps over-anxious to fit the
occult into a scheme of realist metaphysics, whereas on the face
of it it seems rather to contest the unique reahty of the physical
world our science has constructed, and to point to vistas radiating
out from the same material of immediate experience in a great
variety of directions. The indications seem to be distinctly
pluralistic, and they certainly look easier to interpret idealistically.
But it is perhaps a Uttle premature to dispute about the philo-
sophic interpretations of phenonema that are still so imperfectly
known and controlled.
(2) Dr. Winkler's pamphlet is a medical appreciation of Coue's
30 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Feb., 1925-
methods, which ajiproves of his practices while rejecting his-
theories. Dr. Winkler emphasizes the need of cooperation between
the will to heal of the doctor and the will to get well of the
patient, and relates (p. 11) how the victims of morbid itching
whom he had treated with amyl nitrite and temporarily relieved
were able to repress an attack by merely imagining this treatment.
(3) Dr. Missriegler is an enthusiastic Freudian and an opponent
of medical materiahsm. He regards suggestion as always involving
an appeal to a dissociated part of the self, of which normal
consciousness in not aware, and holds that aifto-hypnosis is always-
in ultimate analysis dependent on /ieiero-hypnosis.

ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF MEMBERS.
The Annual General Meeting of Members of the Society was
held at 31 Tavistock Square, London, W.C., on Friday,
January 30th, 1925, at 3.30 p.m. ; The President in the
chair. The following Members w'ere present : Mr. W. W.
Baggally, Miss Jephson, Sir Lawence Jones, Bart., Mrs.
Kingsley, Mr. W. H. Salter, Miss Scatcherd, Mr. W. S. Mont-
gomery Smith and Dr. V. J. Woolley ;
(and, by proxy, Mr.
Henry Bury, Mr. F. C. Constable, Miss Dutton, Rev. W. S.
Ir^^ng, Mss S. M. Kingsford, Dr. T. W. Mitchell, Mrs. W. H.
Salter, Mr. H. F. Saltmarsh, Dr. F. C. S. Schiller, Mrs. Henry
Sidgwick and Mr. W. Whately Smith).
The Chairman presented the Report of the Council. Mr.
W. H. Salter read the Report to the Meeting ; and discussion
was invited.
The Hon. Treasurer (Mr. W. H. Salter) in presenting
the Financial Statement said that there was not much more
to say about the finances than had been said in the Report
which he had just read. The Society had, both in 1923 and
1924, been fortunate in receiving donations from several
members, by virtue of which it had acquired a very satisfactory
Seance Room and had a sum in hand towards equipping it
with special apparatus, as well as a certain sum for a specific
36 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mae., 1925
investigation. He thought that members did not always under-
stand that any single investigation of a medium entailed a
great deal of expense, e.g. the recent investigation of Herr
Willi Schneider had cost more than £200 ; and in addition
there would be the expense of publishing a Report. Mediums
must be engaged well ahead. He beheved in a forward poUcy
as regards investigating any mediums wilUng to accept the
properly vigorous conditions imposed by the tS.P.R. In order
to make these arrangements well in advance, the Society
must have money in hand to carry them out. With this
object a sum, comparatively small as it was for the work
in view, had during the past year been placed in a temporary
investment realisable without delay at any time. But he
urged that it was imperative to increase the settled income
of the Society, and particularly that of the Endowment Fund,
and he hoped that Members would use their influence in
this respect.
The Chairman announced that the six retiring Members
of Council offered themselves for re-election. No other nomina-
tions having been received, the following were declared to
be duly elected Members of the Council : Mr. W. W. Baggally,
Dr. T. W. Mitchell, Mr. W. H. Salter, Mrs. W. H. Salter,
Mr. Sydney C. Scott, and Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.
PRIVATE MEETING.
The 81st Private Meeting for Members and Associates was
held in the House of the Society, 31 Tavistock Square, London,
W.C., on Thursday, February 5th, 1925, at 5.15 p.m.; The
President in the chair.
A Paper entitled " A Report on some Further Evidence
obtained through Mrs. Leonard " was read by Mrs. W. H.
Salter. It is hoped that the full Report will be published
later in the Proceedings.
ANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1924.
A DIFFICULTY from which the Council suffers every year in
maldng its Annual Report to the Society is that of avoiding
a sort of sameness—a sameness which is really inevitable,
Mar., 1925 Atmual Report of the Council 37
because the work we have to do from year to year is so
much the same. For the Society exists to collect and investi-
gate, or rather encourage investigation of, certain phenomena,
and to bring the evidence concerning the supernormal origin
of these up to a sufficiently high standard to be worth con-
sidering. In some cases we succeed in obtaining adequate
evidence and then the results are printed in the Journal or
Proceedings ; but often we fail for various reasons. Occasion-
ally definite evidence that the phenomenon in question is not
supernormal can be discovered, but this is relatively rare.
Of course, it is only selected cases to which our attention is
caUed ; and those in which a normal explanation is fairly
ob\'ious do not as a rule come before us unless the explanation
has some features of special interest. In most of the cases,
v/hether experimental or spontaneous, which we try to investi-
gate, the result tends to be inconclusive, and nothing is
obtained worth reporting. Much time and labour may be spent
by the ofiicers of the Society or by private members on
investigations of this sort, of which the Society never hears,
and which superficially may appear to be spent in vain.
But such work is sometimes very important. It is of course
our business as a Society to classify the facts that come
before us, and to endeavour as far as possible not only to
accumulate evidence, but to throw light on the conditions
and causes of the phenomena. 'For this purpose phenomena
which cannot be regarded as in themselves clear cases of,
say, telepathy, or communication from the dead, or of super-
normal movement of material objects, may yet fall into line
with more decidedly evidential cases and sometimes throw
light on these. Another reason why long perseverance in not
very successful experiments may prove useful, is that possibly
telepathic and other powers may be cultivated and developed.
The assistance received this year from members of the
Society in work and in interest has again been very satis-
factory and much valued.
In the way of new evidence received from members the
most outstanding are the experiments in thought-transference
carried out by Professor Murray, continuing those reported on
in 1916 by Mrs. Verrall. This further set he sent to the Society
38 Journal of ISodety for Psychical Research Mab., 1925
for analysis and report by Mrs. Sidgwick—and this report was
read at a meeting on December 12th and is just about to
appear in Part 92 of Proceedings. The interest excited by
newspaper references to that Meeting has led to private letters
being received from several persons, not members of the
Society, who believe themselves, on apparently good grounds,
to have telepathic faculty of one kind or another, and it is
hoped that this may lead to further good evidence. These
letters, and others sent to the newspapers, show, it is true,
some interest in the subjects of our research, but also wide-
spread ignorance of the objects and even of the existence of
our Society, and it is perhaps worth suggesting to members
the possibility of advertising it by enclosing when writing to
suitable correspondents a copy of the leaflet known as " Objects
of the Society," of which any number of copies can be obtained
from the Secretary.
Another long record of experiments and of some other
plienomena during the last ten years has been sent by a
member of the Society who made a systematic effort during
that time to get into touch with a deceased relative, and to
obtain from him, by answers to questions and otherwise,
information unknown to the sitters. Most of the attempts
were made with an alphabet and a tumbler serving as pointer,
on the Ouija-board plan, the automatist who seemed to affect
the movements most being usually blindfolded and often not
knomng the question. Great pains were taken in selecting
the questions, and in investigating the correctness of the
answers and other information given. The result gives indica-
tion of some success in establishing the identity of the com-
municator, and there is comparatively little error ; but owing
perhaps to poor automatism, or restriction imposed on the
communicators by questions put by the experimenter, there
is too little in the communications definitely and unmistakably
right, to be worth publishing. There are, however, interesting
points, and we are glad that the experimenter has allowed
her long manuscript record to remain at the rooms, so that
it is available for the use of serious students.
At the other end of our scale, some time was spent in
looking into a case of supposed communication from the dead,
Mae., 1925 Annual Meport of the Council 39
which turned out to be a rather elaborate hoax perpetrated
by a member of a circle of friends. It was described in the
Journal for October last under the title "A Fictitious Com-
municator."
As regards experiments—the members of the group, includ-
ing Jliss Newton, who, as mentioned in our last report, were
experimenting regularly in telepathy and clairvoyance, are
still at work, and generally meet once a week. They are,
however, not yet prepared to report their results. They would
gladly welcome members or friends who have reason to think
that they possess some telepathic faculty.
Mr. Dingwall has continued in our Seance-room the experi-
ments which were begun in 1923 with the young German
ladv—not a professional medium—whom we mav call !iVIiss
V J. .y
Hermann. The experiments have been carried on at intervals
throughout the year, and the phenomena—chiefly raps and
movements of objects without contact—are interesting, but
Mr. Dingwall would prefer to obtain further results before
reporting. We are much indebted to Miss Hermann and the
lady she lives with, for the kind way in which they have
co-operated with Mr. Dingwall.
Another series of sittings has been carried out by Mr.
Dingwall in the Seance-room with a young man mth whom
some unusual photographic phenomena are said to occur.
This gentleman, who is a near relative of one of our members,
has very kindly lent himself to experiment, and demands the
strictest test conditions. Results of some interest have been
intermittently obtained, but not as yet in sufficient quantity to
warrant a conclusion as to their nature.
A short series of sittings was also held in the Seanee-room
\vith a professional medium in whose presence it was reported
that luminous appearances had been observed. The sittings
were, however, uniformly negative in result, and were therefore
discontinued.
Towards the end of the year, by invitation from the Council,
the Austrian medium, Willi Schneider, visited England
accompanied by Mrs. Holub, widow of the late Dr. Holub.
The sittings, which were under the direction of Dr. WooUey,
were held in the Seance-room, and some excellent results were
40 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mah., 1925'
obtained under good conditions : both levitation of objects
untouched by the medium, and movements of objects within
a gauze cage such as that used with this medium by Dr.
von Schrenck-Notzing at Munich (see Journal for October
1922). It is intended to publish an account of these experi-
ments shortly.
The Seance-room, described and photographed in the Decem-
ber Journal, has been found most convenient for all these
series of sittings ; and the various fittings and arrangements,
mostly planned and carried out by Mr. Dingwall, work smoothly
and well.
The Research Officer made two visits abroad during the
year—one to Copenhagen in January, to investigate the
phenomena said to occur with Einer Nielsen and with another
Danish medium. The results were not satisfactory, as the
conditions demanded by the mediums prevented any decision
being reached as to the origin of the phenomena.
His second visit was to Paris in February on the invitation
of the late Dr. Geley to be present at sittings with the Italian
medium, Pasquale Erto. An account of his impressions, and
of the subsequent discrediting of the bona fides of the medium
by a committee in Paris, was given in the Journal for June
1924.
Mr. Dingwall is now abroad again, partly on behalf of the
Society, and partly for private purposes, and hopes to make
a series of enquiries both in Europe and America bearing on a
number of public and private mediums.
An attempt by Dr. WooUey and Mr. Dingwall to investigate
a poltergeist case of special interest in Leicester, in which
they were greatly helped by one of our members in that town.
Miss G. Vincent, should also be mentioned. On a first visit,
which was made by Mr. Dingwall alone, some curious pheno-
mena were observed, for which he was unable to perceive any
normal explanation ; but on his second visit, when he Avas
accompanied by Dr. WooUey, the phenomena had completely
ceased, and they have not since recurred. The accounts given
to our investigators indicated that while the phenomena were
mainly spontaneous, they could also be induced by setting up
ap])ropriate conditions.
Mae., 1925 Annual Report of the Council 41
We may take this opportunity of thanking members who
have reported to us cases occurring in their neighbourhood,
or have sent newspaper accounts of cases elsewhere. We
should be very glad if more members would make a practice
of helping us in this way.
During the year Mr. Baggally made attempts to induce
the Zancigs to submit to an investigation, but they regretted
having to refuse on the ground of want of time.
An investigation of " Eyeless sight " was also contemplated,
and one of our members, Lady Malmesbury, offered to con-
tribute towards the expense, but omng to the fact that M.
Romain's trained subjects were apparently no longer available,
and to his absence from Paris, it was not found possible to
arrange for any experiments.
There has been some re-arrangement of administrative work.
Dr. Woolley has during the year undertaken the post of
Honorary Research Officer instead of that of Honorary Secre-
tary, and it has involved him in a very considerable amount
of work, especially during the sittings with Willi Schneider.
Mr. Salter has added the work of joint Honorary Secretary
to that of Honorary Treasurer.
By the resignation of Miss Radclyfie Hall in April, and the
death of Sir George Beilby in , August, the Council has lost
two of its co-opted members. Miss Radclyffe Hall resigned on
account of pressure of other work, and is anxious that it
should not be supposed that she has in any way lost interest
in our researches. And in fact, we hope in due time to
receive from her and Lady Troubridge more evidence of as
good quality as that already published.
Three Corresponding Members were elected during the year :
Professor Oesterreich of Tubingen, Mr. Carl Vett of Copen-
hagen, and Dr. Geley. We regret that only six months after
the election of the last, he was killed in an aeroplane crash.
We have lost by death two other Corresponding Members :
Professor Stanley Hall of Worcester, Mass., and Mr. Severin
Lauritzen of Copenhagen ; and also an Honorary Associate of
long standing. Professor M. T. Falcomer of Venice.
We have lost by death during the year nine Members and
eight Associates, among whom we have to regret several
42 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mar., 1925
friends and supporters of long standing, including the Very
Hev. Hastings Rashdall, Mr. James T. Hackett, Captain Kelso,
Miss F. M. Charlton, Mrs. Charles Baker, and Mr. F. H.
Eradley, O.M. The names of nineteen Members and nine
Associates have been struck off the lists owing to the non-
payment of subscriptions. During the past year thirty-six
Members and nineteen Associates resigned, some of whom
state that they are resigning for financial reasons only, and
several hope that they may rejoin later.
Sixty-two new Members and three Corresponding Members
have been elected, and six Associates have become Members.
The total membership of the Society now stands at 1,123, of
Avhom 568 are Members and 555 Associates.
Three Parts of Proceedings M'ere published during the year :
Part 90 in May, Part 91 in July, and Part 93 in June.
The amount received by the sale of the Society's publica-
tions to Members and Associates is £36 Is. lOd. ; no complete
sets of the Proceedings or the Journal were sold. The amount
realised by sales to the public by Mr. Francis Edwards is
£63 9s. 8d. ; and by the Society's American Agents, £17 18s. lOd.
As in 1923, the Council have pleasure in recording several
very generous donations. Three donors, who wish to remain
anonymous, have between them contributed £978 10s. lOd.
towards the building and equipment of the Seance-room, and
towards the Research work. Out of this, £505 17s. has been
invested temporarily for Research. A donation of £160 was
also made to the Endowment Fund.
Moreover a donation of £200 for printing expenses was
received, and Lord Dunraven generously contributed another
£200 towards the publication of his " Experiences in Spiritual-
ism with D. D. Home," issued as Part 93 of the Proceedings,
as well as in book form.
It will be observed from the Balance Sheet that if the
Society's funds had not been so largely increased by these
donations, the Society would not have been in a position
to finance out of its current income an investigation on
the scale of that of the mediiini Willi Schneider, without
cutting down expenses in other directions, e.g. the issue of
publications.
Mar., 1925 Annual Report of the Council 43
Now that the Society has, for the first time in its history,
a well-equipped Seance-room, and also has definite prospects
of investigating several mediums, the Council take this oppor-
tunity of pressing upon Members and Associates not only
the necessity of increasing the membership of the Society,
in order that the Society's work may not be hampered by
lack of money, but also, for the same reason, the urgent
claims of the Endowment Fund. An Endowment Fund, properly
invested and thus assuring a permanent income, enables the
Council to plan and carry out schemes which would be almost
impossible without it. Our Research Ofiicer, for instance, is
paid from the income of the Endowment Fund, and much
could be done with an assured income larger than our present
Endowment Fund furnishes.
The Council wish to assure Members and Associates tha,t the
administrative work of the Society is conducted with the
utmost regard for economy. When the move to the Society's
present premises was contemplated, it was estimated that,
though the move would entail immediate expense, the ultimate
result would be a substantial saving. The Council are pleased
to record that these anticipations have been justified. For
the year ending Michaelmas 1924, the net cost of the Society's
tenancy of 31 Tavistock Square (rent, rates, repairs, house-
keeper's wages, etc.) was £222, as compared ^vith £289 for the
last year at Hanover Square. Moreover, if the Society had
remained in its old quarters this last figure would have been
increased to £374.
The Council have approved, under certain conditions named
in the Journal for November last, p. 327, of giving small
groups of Members and Associates the opportunity of meeting
at the Society's Rooms for the purpose of relating their personal
experience of, and discussing, various aspects of psychical
research.
The Council desires to speak in the highest terms of the
zeal and energy of its salaried officials.
Four General Meetings, two Private Meetings and a Con-
versazione were held during the year.

CASE.
L. 1264. A Case of Apparent Telepathy.
We print below a letter from one of our members, Mr. H. F.
Saltmarsh, in which he records what appears to have been an
instance of spontaneous telepathy, occurring during a series
of experiments designed to test clairvoyance.
Mr. Saltmarsh writes as follows :
—
2bth January, 1925.
Dear Madam,—I beg to report what appears to me to be a
clear case of telepathy.
My wife and 1 were undertaking some experiments in card
guessing. A card was drawn from a full pack and held in the
hand without being looked at and then guessed. The results
were recorded, and the score, according to Mr. Fisher's table
{Proc. Vol. XXXIV. p. 181), worked out.
On 24th December, 1924, my wife was seated on one side of the
dining-room table and was drawing cards from a pack for guessing.
I was seated on the other side scoring, the distance between us
being roughly five feet. As she drew the second card of the
series I happened to see it and wondered at the moment whether
it would affect the result. She immediately guessed the card and
said that she knew her guess was correct ; the name of the card
* General Meetings.
Mab., 1925 Case 45
flashed across her mind instantly, and the feeling was totally
different from ordinary guessing.
The score for a correct guess according to Mr. Fisher's table
is 34-55 for chance, 444 for this series.
In the five sets of experiments done by my wife she had no
other complete success, and her average score was about equal
to that due to pure chance. I made a note of the occurrence at
the time on the back of the scoring card and enclose it for your
inspection.
The mere fact of the correct guess taken alone would not be
enough to suggest telepathy, for such coincidences must occasionally
occur, but that the knowledge of the card should flash across
the mind in the one case where the card was seen by another
person and never in any other instance, renders the hypothesis
of telepathy extremely probable.
Yours faithfully,
H. F. Saltmarsh.
Together with this letter Mr. Saltmarsh enclosed the card
upon which was recorded the result of the experiment on
December 24th, 1924, thus :
—
Date 24 Dec. 1924.
Guess Card Actual Card
1. 7 Hearts. 3 Diamonds.
2. Knave Clubs. Knave Clubs.
3. 10 Diamonds. Ace Hearts.
4. 6 Spades. 8 Diamonds.
5. 2 Hearts. 4 Spades.
The card is initialled by Mrs. Saltmarsh, and with reference
to the second experiment in the series Mr. Saltmarsh has
written on the back of the card :
—
In this case it happened that I saw the card as my wife took
it from the pack. She said that the knowledge of the card
flashed across her mind immediately, almost like a definite thing,
and quite different from the other guesses. This appears an
excellent case of telepathy.

PRIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AKD ASSOCIATES
The 82nd Private Meeting for Members and Associates was

Square, London, W.C., on Wednesday, March 18th, 1925, at
5 p.m.. The President in the chair.
A paper entitled " A Report on Physical Phenomena recently
observed " was read by Mr. E. J. Dingwall. It is hoped that

PROFESSOR MURRAY'S EXPERIMENTS IN TELEPATHY.
{We print belotv a letter by Dr. Thouless, Senior Lecturer in
PsycJiology at the University of Manchester, on the subject of
Professor Gilbert Murray's experiments in telepathy, a report on
which was recently published in Part XCII. of "Proceedings." Dr.
Thouless's letter appeared originally in the "Manchester Guardian."
We are glad to know that Dr. Thouless is prepared to consider
the evidence in so fair and open-minded a way, and that he
realises—as not all psychologists appear to do—that where the
human mind is concerned some latitude must be allowed in regard
to conditions of experiment.
We hope that it may at some time be possible to carry out
further experiments with Professor Murray with the object of
determining more exactly the nature and limits of his remarkable
powers.)
The newspaper correspondence which has resulted from the
reports of experiments on thought-transference carried out by
Lord Balfour and Professor Gilbert Murray brings out very clearly
the difference between the assurance with which most people
accept telepathy as an unquestionable fact, and the hesitation
which psychologists show in admitting it as a scientific fact at
52 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, ]925
all. Thus Professor Titchener, the leading experimental psycho-
logist of our time, says :
" No scientifically-minded psychologist
believes in telepathy." This seems to be rather an extreme
statement when we bear in mind that Professor Bergson, Professor
McDougall, and the late William James are all declared believers
in telepathy. Titchener's statement, however, does indicate a
point of view which is common amongst experimental psycho-
logists, and Dr. Wohlgemuth's letter on the subject in Tuesday's
Times echoes the same scepticism. This hesitation deserves more
attention than it commonly receives from the upholders of telepathy,
for it springs from a well-founded dissatisfaction with the methods
by which experiments in telepathy are often carried out, and
with the quality of evidence which is commonly regarded as
sufficient for the support of the startling assertion that there are
other modes of communication of knowledge than the sense-organs
which our examination of the human body reveals to us.
It must be admitted that the contribution of laboratory psycho-
logists to psychical research is not always very helpful. Too often
it consists in prescribing arbitrary conditions under which the
phenomena must take place if they are to be believed. What
would we think of a physicist who said that he would not believe
in photography unless the whole process of exposing and develop-
ing a plate could take place under his observation in full daylight
or in ball-lightning imless it could be produced in his own back
garden at a prescribed date ? Yet psychologists often adopt an
attitude not far removed from this in their criticisms of psychical
research, and even as open-minded an observer as the late Pro-
fessor Stanley Hall said :
" Only when conditions can be so
controlled that, e.g., a teacher can announce beforehand that, on
such a day, hour, and place he will demonstrate these things
[telepathy and clairvoyance] can or will they be accepted by any
sound scientific mind."
The central point of interest in these and all similar experi-
ments is the question of whether the mode of communication
between the reader and the receiver of his messages is of an
unknown nature. It is clear that these particular experiments
were successful a greater number of times than could be accounted
for by chance alone. Two hypotheses are possible in order to
account for their success, and these two hypotheses must be kept
sharply distinct. First, the ideas received by Professor Murray
April, 1925 Professor Murray's Experiments in Telepathy 53
may have come to him through a channel entirely different from
those of our ordinary sense organs. Secondly, his ears may have
received sound-waves which, although too faint to give sensations
of sound, were yet strong enough to start the train of thought
which the words were intended to convey. The first is the
hypothesis of telepathy, the second is the hypothesis that the
results were due to hypersesthesia.
A good deal of confusion of thought can be avoided if we
resolve to use the word " telepathy " only for a supposed mode
of communication independent of all known sense organs. If
this was the kind of communication which took place, we can
say nothing of its properties ; these must be found out by experi-
ment. If the hypersesthesia explanation is the true one, the
facts are of less revolutionary interest, and presumably hyper-
aesthetic hearing will follow much the same laws as ordinary
hearing.
The correspondence which has already appeared in various
papers on this subject has shown that most persons have already
made up their minds as to which of these two explanations is
the true one, and that they are prepared to defend the explanation
they have chosen with some heat. Perhaps, therefore, it will be
worth while to consider very shortly what hnes of evidence could
lead us to make a decision between the two alternative explanations.
It is no sufficient evidence against the theory that the results
were due to sound-waves too faint to produce sensations of sound
to say either that sounds could only be interpreted by a person
who was conscious of hearing them or that this explanation is
ruled out by the fact that there was a large room between the
speaker and the person receiving his messages. It is certain
that a stimulus may be the starting-point of a train of thought
before it is strong enough to be perceptible, and if this is the
case nothing but experiment can decide what limits this capacity
has. It may indeed be impossible for thought to be affected by
sound waves which have traversed two walls and a large room,
but it may, on the other hand, be possible, even if the waves
have travelled ten times that distance. This must be found out
before we finally reject the hypothesis of hyperaesthesia.
It may be possible to find a conclusive test to decide between
these hypotheses. Every physical vibration which can give rise
to a sensation obeys the law of inverse squares
—
i.e., if the
54 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 1925
distance from the source of the vibrations is doubled, these are
received at a quarter of their original strength ; if it is trebled,
their strength is reduced to a ninth. It is possible that com-
munication by telepathy does not follow this law. There is some
indication that it does not, for successful telepathy experiments
have been reported between experimenters in different countries,
although the percentage of successes in these experiments was so
small that we must remain doubtful of their interpretation. In
the experiments on Professor Gilbert Murray, however, we seem
to have a subject who gives a high percentage of correct answers.
It ought to be easy to find out whether increase in the distance
between the reader and the subject does or does not cause a rapid
increase in the percentage of error. If there were such an increase,
this would, of course, be no final evidence against the telepathy
theory, for the unknown source of telepathic communication may
itself obey the law of inverse squares. If, however, it could be
shown that increasing the distance even to a very great extent
did not produce a great increase in the number of errors, this
would be very strong evidence indeed in favour of the " telepathy
"
explanation.
It is to be hoped that these experiments will not stop at the
point of demonstrating that communication of some sort exists.
By the ordinary methods of scientific research—isolation and
independent variation of all the conditions under which com-
munication takes place—it should not be difficult to settle con-
clusively all the questions that are still in dispute. Such a
research should show whether the results are to be explained by
telepathy or by hypersesthesia ; and if by telepathy, it should
provide material for formulating the laws of telepathic com-
munication.—Yours, etc., R. H. Thouless.

THE PRESENT POSITION OF THE DIVINING ROD QUESTION
IN GERMANY!
By Count Carl v. Klinckowstroem, of Munich.
Whilst in England the phenomenon of the Divining Rod is looked
upon generally, since Sir W. F. Barrett's comprehensive articles,
^ Translated from the German.
April, 1925 The Divining Rod Question in Germany 55
as a psychic phenomenon having its basis in a supernormal
sensitiveness of the dowser himself bordering on clairvoyance,—in
Germany, since well-known physicists have interested themselves
in the question,^ the point of view already discussed in these
columns {S.P.R. Journal, Dec. 1912) has been further investigated
and confirmed, viz. : that it is essentially a matter of physical-
physiological reflex manifestations. The physiological processes
occasioned by the reaction of the divining rod have in recent
years been to a large extent explained. Concerning this, the
following brief particulars may be given :
We must separate from each other three component parts of
divining rod phenomena :
(1) The hypothetical physical stimulus of the dowser.
(2) The occurrence of reaction.
(3) The interpretation of the latter through the dowser.
Wherein the susceptibility of the dowser lies is stiU wholly
unexplained. Why is one person musical aud another not ?
It may be a question of some atavistic sense vestige which is
perhaps paralleled by the so-called weather sensibility found in
many people.
In this connection all kinds of more or less vague theories
have been advanced in which electricity and radio-activity hold
the chief place.
^
^ Hans Palkinger's pamphlet, which, was sent to me for discussion (The
Divining Bod, 192S, Leijizig and Vienna : published by Waldheim-Eberle)
stands, so to speak, in the middle between the two points of view. It is
a. remarkable little book. Pertinent remarks and observations are mixed
up with others, which leave one sceptical. The suggestion of the Benedictine
symbohc mysticism is discredited, as he shows in interesting fashion, but
not dead. But Falkinger's own hypothesis, though not enlarged upon, of
psychic rays and their deflection by the object sought, is only an intellectual
stox^-gap. FaUdnger finds all that he looks for ; his divining rod, or one-
handed rod, or even the bare hand, gives him the answer to all he asks.
It becomes to him an oracle,—like Planchette to spiritualists. And from
the twitching hand to automatic writing is only a little step. Falkinger
is a clairvoyant medium. Whether he really has at his command clairvoyant
faculties cannot in any way be proved from his own statement as to his
observations, and would require to be made clear by experiments. The real
divining rod problem ajspears to me not to have much to do with such
things, inasmuch as the rod operates as a detector unconsciously to the ^
perceptions.
^ I would venture, in regard to several of the enquiries and views here briefly
dealt with, to refer to my pamphlet The Divining Rod as a Scientific Problem,
with Appendix "Aids from Geophysics," Stuttgart: Konrad Wittwer, 1922.
56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 1925-
In recent years several physicists have turned their attention
to this question. Dr. R. Ambronn, Professor of Physics at the
Geophysical Institute " Brda " at Gottingen, has come to the-
conclusion, from his own experiments, that the dowser reacts in
such places where sudden alterations in the radio-active conditions
may be ascertained by means of special geophysical methods.
For instance, in places where there are ores, slag, etc., Ambronn
inclines to the opinion that the dowser responds to these sudden
alterations, and that therefore an effect from vibrations may be
expected on the nervous systems of particularly sensitive people.
The physicists, Eduard Haschek (Vienna) and K. E. Herzfeld
(Munich), have made very thorough tests at the Second Physics
Institute of the University of Vienna with a dowser (Bergrat
Lukas Waagen), and have come to the conclusion that not any kind
of ray, but electrostatic vibration fields (alterations of tension
must here be taken into consideration), to which the dowser would
respond where geological strata (permeated by earth currents) of
conductivity different from that of their surroundings or zone of
disturbance, alter the electric field.
That would also, for example, be the case with water-conducting
slag with higher radio-active rays, or with beds of iron ore,
which are always manifested by a considerable decrease in the
activity on the earth's surface. The considerations from which
Haschek and Herzfeld started their experiments, and the con-
clusions they arrived at, are shortly as follows : Electric currents
(the earth currents) are always flowing through the soil, as to
the causes and laws of which our knowledge is still admittedly
very scanty. Now the currents will flow freely into the better
conductors of the soil, while the inferior conductors will receive
them in less degree. This lack of uniformity in the course of the
currents, which has its origin in the unequal resistance of the soil,
wiU also manifest itself in the state of tension, that is to say,
in the area of the electric field.
Let us suppose for the moment that the soil is quite homo-
geneous and penetrated by an even current, so that the resistance
would be everywhere equal, and the conditions of tension equal
everywhere also,—the areas of equal tension (surface or potential
areas) being perpendicular to and at equal distances from the
ground,—the electric force will run parallel to it with constant
power. Let us now place something heterogeneous in the ground,.
April, 1925 The Divining Rod Question in Germany 57
and the resistance will be altered at this spot. If the conduc-
tivity is greater (ore, water) the state of tension is less, and the
surface areas (niveaufiachen) disperse. If the conductivity is less
than in the surrounding ground (e.g. hollows), the tension
(spannungsverbrauch) is correspondingly greater, and the lines of
force and the surface areas crowd more closely together. Only
in a single instance will the electric field not be influenced,—that
is when the heterogeneity (mineral lode or flow of water) is
accidentally parallel to the earth current ; then the intensity of
the current increases there so far that the condition of tension,
is equal both inside and out. Only where currents cross the
heterogeneity is it apparent in the electric field. If one compares
these conclusions with observations on the practices of the dowser,
it is found to be in accord, and a full explanation of many failures.
It becomes clear why a uniform reflector of underground water
fails to affect the dowser, but that wherever there are other kinds
of water (streams), such places can be discovered by the rod.
Also the finding shows at once that the dowser in the case of
a flow of water or linear mineral lodes is often only in a position
to indicate certain parts ; should the earth current at such a spot
be exactly parallel to the supply, no result will be obtained. Not
the earth current in itself, the two investigators are led to believe,,
or its alterations, are what the dowser feels, but the distortions
of the electric field in which he finds himself. The electric field
is subject to such distortions owing to any isolated bodies present
in it. Any alteration of the structure, no matter how caused,
of the electric field must produce its effect, as also ionised gases,
even the accumulation of ions in a free field, which would confirm
the observation of Ambronn on the co-existence of observed radio-
active elements and deflections of the rod in connection with
mineral slag, etc.
Haschek and Herzfeld emphasise finally that their explanation
cannot be more than a first attempt at a physical theory of the
divining rod. Only when the material for observation is quite
cleared up, can one really decide as to the utility of the theory.
For the present we cannot regard it as more than a working
hypothesis.
Physiologists and psychologists—such as Professors R. Grase-
berger (Vienna), R. Sommer (Giessen), and the Dresden nerve
specialist, Dr. H. Haenel, have long endeavoured to explain the
68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Apeil, 1925
reaction when the rod deflects. Whilst the first asserts that the
reaction is only the effect of pure psychical stimulus (imaginative
ideas, expectation or even unconscious perception and interpre-
tation of the peculiarities of the ground), and inclines to the old
ideomotor method of explanation, Haenel and Sommer take the
view of a dynamic relation existing between earth and man.
Haenel, who has instituted the most thorough scrutiny of this
question,^ starts in his explanation of the processes from the
normal, or at any rate usual standpoint, when the rod deflects
:
holding the fork ends with an undergrip, that is to say, the palms
of the hands upwards (in supination), placing the upper part of
the arm close to the body, the rod held with the pointers
horizontally to the front, whereby it comes into a condition of
tension more or less. The greater the power of resistance, and at
the same time the more elastic the substance of the rod, so much
the more vigorous will be the pull on the ends of the fork,
but all the greater too the resistance of the rod itself to this
movement.
The ends of the fork tend, in this position, to approach one
another, and naturally seek to attain this end by the way of
least resistance. This is to be found in the position of supination ;
as the palms of the hands (which were upwards at first) turn
inwards (change into pronation), the ends of the fork approach
each other once more and the point of the rod strikes downward,
and the tense " muscle-rod-system " previously in equipoise now
relaxes.
According to Haenel, when the rod deflects it is a question
only of the yielding—the relaxing of a tightened muscle amongst
a number of others which remained relaxed. It needs only quite
a slight shock, which may be due to a delicate impression on
the mind, or even a j^urely psychic condition, to induce this
outstretched apparatus to relax at any point ; and immediately
the latent energy is transformed into activity, the rod jerks
violently into a position of rest.
Privy Councillor Professor Sommer has definitely established
that in the dowser, even before the actual deflection of the rod,
involuntary slight alterations of the muscle tension take place,
which are apparent in spasmodic movements of the finger and
^ Vol. 8 of the Records of the Society for enquiring iato the Divining Rod
problem.
April, 1925 The Divining Rod Question in Germany 59
iands. In fact, in many cases, a typical alteration takes place
in the dowser's whole bearing, so that slight ulnar inflexion occurs
in the forearm. On this there quickly foUows the deflection of
the rod. The divining rod is therefore, according to Sommer,
a strongly magnifying indicator of minute alterations of tension
of the muscle in a definite nerve tract (Ulnaris).
The train of reasoning which Sommer connects with these
observations is interesting {Periodical of Divining Rod Research,
Oernrode-in-Harz, Nos. 9-10). The same nerve tract comes into play
with the dowser as with a bird in flight and with a man in
swimming movements. According to Sommer, this parallel physio-
logical relation points to the fact that in the flexion movements
of the ulna in dowsers a quite primitive kind of movement is
involved, which man has inherited from ancient times from a
primeval method of locomotion which has some relation to flying.
In conclusion, with regard to the practical application of the
•divining rod to the discovery of the earth's treasures, this is
without doubt the problematical side of the whole question. The
explanation of the reaction through the dowser, on account of
the numerous possibilities of the effect of excitement, easily offers
occasion for wrong diagnosis and mistakes. From the records of
experiments so far before us, definite conclusions cannot be drawn,
chiefly because the reactions of the various dowsers are of such
markedly different character. This question can only really be
satisfactorily settled through long years of practical co-operation
between geologists and dowsers, recognised as trustworthy and
-experienced observers, which might ultimately clear the matter uj).
In this connection the Professor of Geology at the University of
HaUe, Professor Johannes Walther, has already made an en
couraging beginning.^
Note.—In a recently published pamphlet ^ Prof. Dr. A. Wendler,
(Erlangen), has reached a different conclusion, based on experiments
vfith a trustworthy dowser, a First Commissioner of Woods and
Forests. The complex phenomenon of the divining rod cannot,
according to Wendler, be regarded as a mere reflex reaction.
He has come to the conclusion that we must assume a " biological

radiation," as in another connection this has already been postu-
lated by Durville, Alrutz and others. Considering that it is a
physical expert, who at the same time is fully acquainted with
the psychical sources of error, who sets forth these rather bold
theories, the book may lay claim to serious notice. It is to be
hoped that Wendler's experiments and conclusions will be examined
by other experts, and with other dowsers.
THE " MARGERY " MEDIUMSHIP
Readers of the Journal, who have followed the history of the-
" Margery " mediumsliip in the current literature as indicated in.
the Notes on Periodicals, will be aware that a Committee of
the Scientific American has been long investigating her claims.
This Committee has now decided not to award the prize of
$2500 for which she had entered. Owing to the controversy
that the case had aroused, and also owing to the natural,
interest that I felt in the phenomena presented, I visited
Boston at the kind invitation of " Margery " and her husband
and have only recently returned.
The phenomena I observed fall broadly into four main
classes : Auditory, Luminous, Teleldnetic, and Teleplastic. The
auditory phenomena consist almost exclusively of a voice,
alleged to be the voice of the medium's control, Walter, who
was the brother of the medium and who was killed in a
railway accident some years ago. This voice, it is claimed,
is independent of that of the medirma and originates for
the most part at about three inches from her head. The
luminous phenomena are very varied, but I had only the
opportunity of observing one class of such occurrences, which,
consisted of vague luminous shapes, sometimes upon the table
and sometimes upon the medium's dress, which faded and
then increased in brilliance, a phenomenon which occurred
several times during the short time that the appearance re-
mained visible. The teleldnetic and teleplastic phenomena
were by far the finest that I have ever seen, and if fraudulent
must involve a very considerable degree of ingenuity and
manipulative skUl, coupled with elaborate and careful pre-
paration.
Apeil, 1925 The " Margery " Mediumship 61
The sittings are mainly held in the dark, good red light being
permitted only as dictated by the controlling voice, ^Thich
whispers during the whole of the sitting, cracking jokes and
making amusing sallies at the expense of the investigators.
Luminous bands are worn upon the wrists and ankles of the
medium, who wears also a luminous disc upon her forehead.
Similar bands are worn on the wrists of the controllers, one
of whom is usually F. H., the medium's husband, a Boston
surgeon and author of a bulky volume on post-operative
treatment.
The materialisations consist mainly of masses of greyish-
white clammy substance resembling to the touch a cold and
damp blanc-mange. These masses often lie upon the table
in front of the medium in good red light, and can be examined
during the five seconds or so that is permitted. Objects
feeling like clammy tongue-like fins are also observed, and
these appear to seize objects on the table and wave them
about. Ill-formed hands are sometimes seen covered with
greyish or white wrinkled-looking skin, and these formations
are all apparently attached to the body of the medium by
bands or cords, which to the touch appear gristly, and in
places clammy and viscous with knobbly excrescences. I have
repeatedly handled these structures and have observed them
closely in fairly strong red light. The control of the medium
appears to be rigid, and is faultless if we accept Dr. F. H. as a
bona-fide investigator, which, under the circumstances, he is him-
self the first to admit is impossible.
The conditions, therefore, of the sittings, are such that I
cannot at present affirm my belief in the authenticity of these
phenomena. If the occurrences are indeed supernormal, as is
•claimed by the medium, then '"
Margery " is by far the greatest
physical medium alive, and for the purposes of science the
most important physical medium of whom we have any record.
If, on the other hand, the phenomena are produced normally,
then the case assumes an importance which it is impossible
to exaggerate. For then the position of the private medium
is undermined, and all phenomena occurring in a private circle
will have henceforward to be discounted until adequate investi-
.gation demonstrates their reality. In a case of this kind no
62 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 1925
definite decision can be arrived at unless the phenomena occur
under the most rigid test conditions. I hope that an oppor-
tunity for further enquiry may arise, and that it will then,
be possible to arrive at definite conclusions concerning these
amazing occurrences.

THE GLASTONBURY SUB-COMMITTEE
Report to the Council of the Psychical Research Society.
\_Some little time ago Mr. Bligh Bond came to the conclusion
from evidence in his possession that there existed buried treasure-
under the ground within the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey. He had
obtained reports from various dowsers who had located different
spots within the ruins where they indicated that such treasure
might be found.
As he was anxious to obtain from, the Trustees of the ruins
facilities for excavation at the most likely spots, he approached
the Council of the S.P.R. with a request that they should appoint
a Committee to consider his evidence.
The Council accordingly in December last appointed a Committee-
consisting of Sir William Barrett, Sir Lawrence Jones, and Mr.
G. M. Lambert, who after consideration of the evidence have
presented the following report.~EiT).'\
The data placed before the Committee by Mr. Bligh Bond
included the findings of three diviners, Mr. Timms, Miss Turner^
and Mrs. Greig, who had been taken over the site of the
ruins by Mr. Bond. We carefully collated these findings, and
found that in upwards of seven places, the findings of all
three coincided.
We came to the conclusion that there was a good case for
arranging an experiment with a further diviner ; and after
some enquiries, we obtained the services of Mr. Foord of
Shipham, recommended by Sir William Barrett. He went
over the ground on the 10th of March, 1925, and he was.
guided by Mr. Wescombe, architect's assistant of Bristol-
Mr. Wescombe had in his hands a plan of the ruins on which
certain lines only were drawn according to an arrangement
April, 1925 The Glastonbury Sub-Committee 63
previously made by us affording a minimum indication of tlie
directions in which the dowser was to try for results.
Mr. Foord's results have been collated with those of the
earlier diviners. He reacted about seventy times in all, and
of these, twelve reactions coincide quite closely with those of
earlier experimenters. Of these twelve, eight were close to
spots found by all the three previous diviners.
We do not consider that any reliable data have been
furnished as to the depths at which finds of metal might be
discovered, but the indications, such as they are, suggest
depths which might prove serious obstacles if excavation is
tried.
In conclusion, we are of opinion that the data already
obtained present a case for pursuing the search by excavation.

CONCERNING THE FORMATION OF A GROUP FOR
SPECIAL STUDY
We have been asked by one of our Members, Mr. A. W.
Trethewy, to insert the following letter in the Journal.
, Artillery Mansions,
Victoria Street,
London, S.W. 1.
Telephone : FrankHn 6145.
It is suggested that a group should be formed in the S.P.R.
(see Journal for November, 1924, pp. 327, 328) for collecting
information about the practice of Spiritualism in foreign countries^
I have been engaged for a short time in this work, mainly with
a view to seeing whether the communications received from soi-
disant spirits about the environment " on the other side " are
substantially the same in all countries, that is to say, represent
the conditions as resembling those on earth. It seems, however,
that the enquiry may be expanded to embrace other purposes.
It may be possible to indicate fresh lines of experiment by dis-
covering the methods used in other places and to throw Ught on
obscure phenomena of our own mediums by comparing them with
64 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1925
practices employed elsewhere. At this stage it is unnecessary to
discuss the scope and methods of the enquiry in greater detail.
These matters may be left open for consideration. At present all
that I ask is whether, if the date is convenient to you, you will
attend a meeting in the S.P.R. rooms at 31 Tavistock Square
on a day in the latter half of May to be subsequently fixed to
discuss the question and will then decide whether you will join
the group and undertake a share in the researches. Of course
your decision will depend on your approval of the programme.
The date will be intimated to you in due course if you reply
now that you wish to attend the meeting.
REVIEW.
An Investigation into Psychic Phenomena. By J. Arthur Fiistdlay.
(Printed for private circulation.)
In this little book (to which Sir William Barrett, F.R.S., con-
tributes a preface), Mr. Findlay, a Member of our Society and
Vice-President of the Glasgow Society for Psychical Research,
gives an interesting account of sittings held by him during six
years with the Glasgow medium, John Sloan. During this period
Mr. Findlay had thirty-six sittings with Sloan, at which he
claims that one hundred and sixty-nine facts, which it was
impossible for the medium or any one else present to have known
normally, were accurately communicated. Of the incidents printed
at length by Mr. Findlay the first is perhaps the most striking.
Mr. Findlay brought to a sitting his brother, who .had recently
been demobilised ; the brother was not known to any one present
and was not introduced by name. He was hailed by a voice
giving the name " Eric Saunders," which at the time meant
nothing to him. On being questioned, " Eric Saunders " said he
had been trained as a gunner under Mr. Findlay's brother, gave
the name of the small village where they were stationed, mentioned
various incidents which occurred during training, and the date
he completed his course and went abroad. All these details were
subsequently verified.
We have frequently exhorted our Members to bring to the
Society's notice records of successful sittings, and we cordially
welcome this report of what appear to have been remarkable
experiences carefully recorded and annotated.

OBITUAKY.
'
Dr. Sydney Alruxz.
We deeply regret to have to record the death of Dr. Alrutz
of Upsala on February Mth last, at the comparatively early age
•of 57. For tweiifcy-five years Dr. Alrutz has been one of our
most valued and energetic Hon. Associates. He was appointed
lecturer {privat docent) on Psychology in the University of
Upsala in 1901—the funds of the University being inadequate
to support a full Professorship of Psychology. We understand,
however, that the University had recently asked the Swedish
P.arliament for a grant to enlarge the psychological laboratory
and provide a better endowment for the Chair.
Dr. Alrutz devoted himself enthusiastically to the investiga-
tion of hypnotic phenomena, and published a large work,
entitled Till Nervsystemets dynaiHik, etc., or " Dynamics of
the Nervous System," which contains the results of his experi-
mental investigations extending over the years 1913 to 1917
on the suggestibility and nervous energy of subjects, both in
the waking and hypnotic conditions. He continued his re-
searches up to his last illness, and shortly before his death
published two lengthy papers in the Scandvmvian Scientific
Revieiv for last year. These papers give a summary of what
Alrutz considered to be the most important of the questions
discussed in the work already referred to, namely, the problem
of nervous effluence. This problem rightly appeared to Dr.
Alrutz of such great importance, that an English translation
has been issued of these recent papers under the title of "A
new form of Effluence or radiation from the human organism.''
66 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May, 1925
Human Radiation.
Many years ago Dr. Alrutz sent to tlie present writer an
account of a prolonged series of hypnotic experiments he had
made upon a Swedish labourer whose illness he had hypnoti-
cally treated with success,—and who proved to be a very
sensitive subject. These experiments appeared to demonstrate
the fact than an effitience passed from the hypnotiser to the
subject, a belief entertained by the older mesmerists. I was
deeply interested in Alrutz's results, as more than forty years
ago the hypnotic experiments which I made with Edmund
Gurney,—and before that in Ireland,—seemed to indicate the
existence of this effluence. Alrutz invited me to visit him and
verify the results he had obtained. Accordingly in 1911 I
went to Upsala, and the results of my experiments will be
found in the Journal of the S.P.R. for 1912, pp. 178-188.
The conclusion at which I arrived from these experiments,
with Dr. Alrutz's subject, confirmed the view which was ex-
pressed in the second S.P.R. report of the committee on
Mesmerism,—of which Myers, Gurney and myself were members
—and was published in the first volume of our Proceedings for 1883.
We state, on p. 257, that our experiments " make it almost
impossible to doubt the reality of some special force or virtue
passing from one organism to another in the process of mes-
merisation,"' and we record a series of experiments (of which I
have a vivid recollection) which appeared to point out some
kind of effluence passing from the hypnotiser to the subject.
(See Proc, Vol. I., pp. 257-262.) In conclusion we stated that
these experiments, which " were made under accurate scientific
conditions," constituted a strong prima facie case in favour of
this effluence ;
though we acknowledged that the number of
these experiments must be very largely increased before such
a theory could be generally entertained. Subsequently Dr.
Liebeault of Nancy, as the result of numerous experiments,
was also led to the conviction of a specific mesmeric influence.
The therapeutic results he obtained, after submitting very
young children, from three to four years old, to hypnosis,
led him to this conclusion. Some years later Mrs. Sidgwick
and Miss Johnson published in our Proceedings for 1890 an
important paper, in which they discussed these experiments
Mat, 1925 Obituary 67
and those by Dr. Alrutz, and from their experiments were
led to doubt the conckisions arrived at. But Mr. Myers in
Human Personality, Chap. V., says it is "by no means improbable
that effluences, as yet unknown to science, but perceptible to
sensitive persons, should radiate from living human organisms."
Some of the experiments made long ago by Gurney and
myself upon a sensitive subject were so extraordinary thatj we
did not publish them at the time, but subsequently other
evidence supporting these experiments reached me, hence a
brief report of them will be found in my little book on
Psychical Research (see pp. 198-199).^ We found that any
object over which the hypnotiser had made a few passes, or
even pointed his finger at it, could at once be detected by a
sensitive subject, who had been excluded from the room, from
which the hypnotiser had also been excluded, and put in a
separate room. In fact every precaution was taken to avoid
collusion, or of any information reaching the subject, either
normally or telepathically. I am convinced the results were
unquestionable, whatever explanation might be given by further
investigations. But if such an effluence does exist, it appears
to have a polarity like magnetism. A knitting-needle stroked
with one end of a bar magnet becomes magnetised, but a
couple of strokes in the reverse direction demagnetises it.
Dr. Alrutz's experiments not only confirmed the experience
of the older mesmerists that downward passes produced anal-
gesia of the limb of the subject thus treated, and upward
passes restored its sensibility ; this fact,—though imhkely to
be known to the ignorant subject Dr. Alrutz hypnotised,
—
his own knowledge might have telepathically suggested to
the subject. But Alrutz's experiments went much further
and seemed to demonstrate that certain screens were
transparent to this effluence and other opaque. Thus he
found that glass and metal plates were transparent, but
cardboard, wool, etc. were opaque. One of his many experi-
ments may here be quoted : —Two similar screens of a trans-
missive substance, such as glass or metal, were fixed by clips
horizontally, one over each arm of the subject. The experi-
menter then put a thick woollen glove on to one of his hands
^ Home University Library.
68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research may, 1925
and nothing on the other ;
passes were then made respectively
with the gloved and the ungloved hand over each of the two
plates ; the screens were then removed and the sensitiveness
of the subject's arm tested. Only the passes made by the
bare hand produced any effect ; as wool was one of the sub-
stances Dr. Alrutz found to be opaque to the effluence. A
series of experiments are recorded by Dr. Alrutz which appear
to prove that the subject could not have derived, normally, any
sign or guidance as to the nature of the arrangements adopted
in the numerous experiments.
The results of my own experience at Upsala confirmed the
fact of some specific effluence passing from the hypnotiser to
the subject, but they left me somewhat doubtful of the trans-
parency or otherwise of certain screens. I felt convinced that
any normal or even telepathic knowledge did not reach
the subject, but it seemed possible that he might gain informa-
tion of what was being done if he were clairvoyant. However,
it is not fair to put the few experiments I made against the
long and elaborate researches conducted by Dr. Alrutz. More-
over, some of Alrutz's ingenious experiments seemed to meet
this question of clairvoyance, provided the subject had no
information as to the nature of the interposed substances, or
which were likely to be opaque and which transparent.
In 1920 Dr. Alrutz delivered a lecture on the subject before
a large meeting of the S.P.K. ; this was published with numer-
ous illustrations in Vol. XXXII. of our Proceedings. As an
illustration of Dr. Alrutz's remarkable energy and linguistic
talent, the substance of this lecture was first of all given in
Swedish at Stockholm, a day or two later in German at Berlin,
then in French at Paris, and the following day in English at
London. Dr. Alrutz happened to be my guest at the time
and told me what he had done during the preceding week
;
this was the more remarkable as in no case did he read the
paper, but delivered it from a few notes. Mrs. Alrutz informs
me that her husband had recently found a new sensitive, a
Mrs. Mozen, who is a very good hypnotic subject, and she
hopes that our S.P.R. will be able to make experiments with
this subject.
Though Dr. Alrutz's deepest interest was bound up in his
Mat, 1925 Obituary 69
hypnotic experiments and his researches into " nerve radiation,'"
he also studied the psychological effects produced by aviation,
and suggested certain tests for a^dators which he communi-
cated to the authorities, not only in Sweden but also in Eng-
land, France and Germany. He attended many Congresses on
psychology and psychical research, and contributed important
papers to the Congress at Oxford and to the International
Congresses at Copenhagen in 1921, and Warsaw in 1923. He
also published numerous papers on psychology and psychical
research in the Swedish, German, English and American
journals. Shortly before his death Dr. Alrutz had finished a
new book, entitled Hypnotism and Suggestion, which we under-
stand ^^•ill shortly be pubUshed. It is to be hoped that the
" Institute for Psychological Research which he founded in
Upsala vriH continue his experiments, and communicate to the
S.P.R. any results they may obtain.
The Swedish papers contain tributes to the respect in which
Dr. Alrutz was held by his colleagues and friends. Prof.
Ohrvall writes that Dr. Alrutz's experiments compelled him to
admit the existence of a hitherto unknoAvn radiation passing
from the human organism to certain persons. Prof. Svedberg
writes that however difficult orthodox science may find it to
accept the facts, nevertheless he adds :
—" If I am not able
to agree -with the conclusions Dr. Alrutz arrived at, I am of
the opinion that the conscientious care of his work, and the
precautions that he took to eliminate error, are of permanent
value in this difficult branch of scientific research."
In conclusion we may mention that Dr. Alrutz married in
1903, and his charming Swedish wife survives him. They had
only one child, a boy born in 1907. Alrutz was fond of
athletic sports and of yachting ; in his youth he won many
of the prizes offered by the Swedish Royal Yacht Club.
He was taken ill suddenly and had to be operated at once,
and died under the operation before his wife could reach him.
An excellent portrait of Dr. Alrutz has been sent to us, which
can be seen by our members at 31 Tavistock Square. His
portrait gives a glimpse of the enquiring and eager mind he
possessed and his genial and lovable personality.

CASE.
L. 1265. AN APPARENTLY TELEPATHIC DREAM.
The following report of a dream wMcli had an apparently
telepathic origin was first given to the Secretary, Miss Newton,
in conversation by the dreamer, Miss Boucher James, who is a
Member of the Society. We are indebted to Miss James for
the trouble she has taken to collect the evidence and for
permission to use her name.
Subsequently, at Miss Newton's suggestion. Miss Boucher
James sent a written account of her experience in a letter,
as follows :
February 2, 1925.
You asked me to write you the dream I told you of this
afternoon. So here it is . . . I dreamt on Monday night, January
26, 27, without any apparent reason whatever for doing so, that
we were going to a meet—presumably. Mrs. 0. was there, who
is always at the meets, and my younger nephew T. We halted
at the cross-roads and seemed to change about in the cars, and
Mrs. 0. went on in a pony carriage, my nephew leading the pony
up the hill. She hit it—which I thought a mistake—saying to
myself, " The pony's doing its best." I turned my back to them,
and immediately after there was a shout and I turned to see the
pony on its head in a very deep ditch with my nephew under-
neath. Mrs. 0. did not seem hurt. We could hear his groans
and gasps and then to my rehef he stood upright, but looking
frightfully dazed and shaken. In the morning I remembered the
dream and made a brief note of it.
My sister writes :
" B. (my elder nephew) had a pretty bad toss
on Monday [January 26, 1925]. They had had a long run and
came to an unknown jump which his horse refused three times.
T. (my younger nephew and the one dreamt of) gave him a lead,
but, although B. changed from the original place to an easier one,
his horse failed to clear and pitched over with B. partly under
him. T. looking round saw the whole thing and as usual was
first on the scene ... he kept on saying, '
If only it had happened
to me instead.' '
No bones broken, but concussion.'
"
I quote all this to show the younger boy who figured in the
dream, though not the victim, took a very active part materially
and emotionally. ... p_ g_ Boucher J.uies.
Mat, 1925 Case 71
On February -i, 1925, Miss Boucher James wrote again to Miss
l^ewton, enclosing the letter from her sister from which she quoted
in her letter of February 2nd and giving a rather more de-
tailed account of her own dream. The only additional point
it seems necessary to note here is that iVIiss Boucher James
speaks of seeing her nephew standing up after his fall " look-
ing very dazed and confused, his eyes very red—suffused with
red, changing the colour of them." Subsequently, on February
:27th, 1925, Miss Boucher James wrote to Miss Newton, thus :
I saw my nephew when I was iu Devon and asked him to
-tell me about the accident to his brother. The only fresh informa-
"tion was that his eye must have had a blow, as it swelled tre-
mendously. I asked him, " Did you think, or rather, were you
.afraid his eye was hurt, when you saw him fall ?
" " Oh, no,"
lie said, " I thought he was dead." So apparently I got the eye
impression from some other source—unless he went up late that
night and heard of it. He had not evidently seen his brother
when the eye was swollen, as he quoted Mrs. James, the brother's
wife, as his informant.
F. S. Boucher James.
With regard to the c^uestion of when she noted down her
'dream and when she had news of the accident to her nephew
3Iiss Boucher James writes thus :
Since I had the Memory Dream which interested me, I have
kept a book by my bed and briefly note any dream that im-
;presses me. This is cut from it :
" Jany. 27. Dreamt Mrs. 0 and pony and T T. in deej)
ditch, pony on top." ^
The dream entered above this is marked " Jan. 20 " . . . I am
afraid my notes are very brief and often indecipherable. I did
not write the above when I woke, but 1 think during the day,
as I remember the thought coming once or twice, " I must write
that down," and then 1 made the effort—that afternoon, 1
think. In any case I could not have heard the news till Friday
[Jan. 30th], as though my sister's letter is undated, a p.c. from
Jier came by the same post, marked Thursday, and to say " B.

has had 6 hours" sleep,"" and that was the first I knew of
anything being amiss with him.
If it would be more satisfactory to you to see the notebook,.
I will send it. The date I always enter them on is the date
of the morning of the dream (which I had in the night). I ver}''
seldom wake as I finish dreaming, so when I wake in the morning,
that is the date I use. So dreaming on Monday night, the
26th, or early morning, Jan. 27th, I shouldn't know which it was.
If I had thought consciously of either brother hunting, it would
more likely have been B. who is Master of the hounds, and not
T. who is always lending his horses to others, or imagining he is
too busy to go out. F. S. Boucher James.
Subsequently, on February 8, 1925, Miss Boucher James
wrote again to Miss Newton with regard to the question of
when her note of the dream was made. Her recollection is
clear that it was made during Tuesday, January 27th, and
there seems no reason to doubt that it was made before she
had any news of the accident. Miss Boucher James tells us
that she is in the habit of noting dreams of possible psychic
interest on the day after their occurrence. The next entry
in her notebook, after the entry of January 27th, was made-
on February 5th.
Miss Boucher James has also sent us a newspaper cutting
which gives an account of the accident, as follows :
(From the Bideford and North Devon WeeJdy Gazette,
February 3, 192.5.)
Followers of the Stevenstone Hounds, and sportsmen generally
throughout the district, will regret the somewhat serious accident
which befell the popular Master, Col. B. C. James, D.S.O., of
Stevenstone, in the hunting field on Monday of last week. f
Near Finnemore Crate, Sheepwash. when the hounds were in
full cry and had run a fox for three hours. Col. James's horse
refused a bank three times, and when the Master put it at another
part of the fence the horse came down with the rider and partly
rolled on him.
Col. James received a severe kick in the head, and his brother,
Capt. E. H. James, who was riding near him, found him lying
on the ground unconscious.

BRAIN AND SPEECH
We print below a report received from Miss G. Ogden Tubby,
for many years Assistant Secretary to the American Society
for PsycMcal Research, concerning the difficulty experienced by
Dr. Hyslop during his last illness in enunciating certain words
and names.
Miss Tubby sent her report to Sir Oliver Lodge with a
covering letter from which the following extract may be
quoted
:
"
-
Mw/r?/ 24, 1925.
I have long had it in mind to tell you of a most interesting
experience I made note of ui the last illness of Dr. Hyslop.
I wanted to tell you of it this summer, when I hoped to see you.^
Miss Dallas urged me to write to you of it, after I had recounted
it to her. But the time has rolled by all too fast, filled with
matters of more urgence, though less interest.
I am enclosing here the account of the matter I refer to.
It may be of interest in the discussion of Brain and Speech
"
now going on in the S.P.R. Journal, thanks to the attention you
have given the matter in the past year, . . ,
Gertrude Ogden Tubby.
The following statement was enclosed with this letter :
In the course of the illness of James Hervey Hyslop, after his
thrombosis, he had difficulty in enunciating syllables, ordinary
words and proper names, some of which I noted during his
conversations with me. There were certain variations that were
recurrent, although not unalterable, and one became accustomed to
interpreting him. The familiarity of the words or names had
nothing to do with the ease or the difficulty of the enunciations-
There was entirely clear memory and purpose in the remarks
made, when they were interpreted. The memory was unusually
full and clear. He went over all his papers and records, indicating
condition, readiness for use, incompleteness, and so on. Dr.
Hyslop's instant recognition of the correct, or denial of the in-
correct interpretation of his meaning indicated in every instance
his clarity of thought and reference.
74 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May, 1925
One dramatic example he asked me to make public, as I am
now doing. He had tried for a day or two to refer to a case
he had in hand, wishing to see the papers and make some sug-
gestion. His daughter and his nurse could not get his meaning.
He told them the case concerned someone whose name was the
same as one of the Presidents of the United States. They were
young and thought, naturally, of recent Presidents and the more
notable ones of the past. Dr. Hyslop repudiated them all. So
they appealed to me over the telephone and I went up to the
sick-room to set his mind at rest. At once I knew when the
reference was made, that he referred to the " Hayes Case." The
father of the lady he also referred to in an abortive attempt at
the right name, and I spoke that for him. He sighed a deep
sigh of relief and the tears rolled down his face, at the release
from the tension of effort to make himself understood. Said he :
Do you see, I knew it all the time, all the time, tried to say
it, and couldn't make myself clear. No one could understand
what I meant. And this is my own organism. I wasn't guessing
at all, not for one instant. My mind was perfectly clear, memory
•clear all the time. I knew at once when you got the right
reference and the others got it wrong. Do you see ? What if I
had been a poor medium ? Some outside influence trying to
express the same thing through another's organism might have
fared the same way. But I knew all the time what I
meant, and this is my own organism, yet it wouldn't work
for me, rightly. Tell them that, tell them that ! It's a pretty
illustration."
I am happy to avail myself of an opportunity to " tell them
"
what is indeed a very pretty illustration, and a very helpful one,
of the difficulty in expressing through an instrument not
properly co-ordinated for the use of the thinker who is trying to
work it.
Some of the equivalents in Dr. Hyslop's conversation I did not
note, of course, as I was otherwise occupied, but of a few I made
running note as he spoke, and the table below represents these.
The recurrence of the final sound " er " or " eer " was notable.
The number of syllables and the accent were usually correct.
Smead " is a pseudonym for a two-syllabled name, so the count
is right in that, as was the accent.

CORRESPONDENCE.
I. Subliminal Idiosyncrasies.
To the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.
Madam,—Sir Francis Galton in his well-known work on Human
Faculty records a series of interesting idiosyncrasies of number
vision, and other subjective visual phenomena. This surely is a
line of research which might be extended with fruitful results.
Some years ago I was present in a circle of friends when jMiss
Goodrich Freer was asked how one could tell, a propos of scrying,
if one had potential visualising powers. Her reply was in the
76 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May, 1925'
form of a question :
" Wliere was King Alfred sitting when the
cakes were burnt ?
" This led to our comparing notes, and I
was interested to find that my picture differed from those of all
the rest of the company who were accustomed to picture to
themselves, however vaguely, incidents presented to their imagina-
tions. Alfred, as I saw him, sat with the hearth on his right
(more or less) as I stood regarding the scene with the hearth
before me on my left.
Since then further investigation has convinced me that I, being'
inveterately left-handed, regard things, as it were, from my left
side, looking towards the right when visualising, so that the-
centre of interest in the picture is on my right. Further, on
comparing notes with " right-handeds " I have often found that
my visualised pictures are, even in detail, except of course when
description defines positions, practically mirror reversals of theirs.
The same thing holds in the case of illustrated books : if two
people are described standing side by side, I find my picture,,
when I come to the illustration of the author's description, is
wrong : similarly my people always face the opposite way.
My visualisations are not always graphically visible. I some-
times try in the dark to visualise an object, e.g. a rose. I
gaze at the dark red retinal screen in vain sometimes, and nothing
comes. I seize upon the passing lines and blotches and strive
in vain to twist or expand tliem into rose form.
With my attention thus rigidly fixed upon the screen, aftei'
fruitless efforts I become aware that I have no picture of the
rose form in my mind. My object in the experiment was originally
to watch the screen until the rose came : not to force its appear-
ance, or seize upon a fortuitous retinal shape to form a 2^oint de
reiwre. I then try to recollect a rose form. To do this I feel
that I turn my eyes, as the instrument for the purpose, upwards
and over towards the back of my head. Returning with what
1 sought (dimly apperceived as a mental image, faintly visuaHsed
perhaps, but so faintly that I cannot be sure), to the screen, I
often manage to bring the retinal images and lines quickly intO'
service and get a clear vision of a rose, and with relaxed con-
centration, watch the vagaries of its behaviour as it changes its
shape, in the guise of an interested and disinterested spectator.
Sometimes I almost get my rose when it proves recalcitrant
and will not lie flat or keep still, and a really exhausting effort
3lAY, 1925 Gorresfondence 77
.and tussle are required to " get it under." The corolla, to quote
-an example of its behaviour, sets itself edgewise, flattens to a
plate and spins and gyrates upon the stalk as axis.
I can do nothing with it edgeways, so with a supreme and
•dizzy final effort " I " swoop upwards and forwards and come
down upon it. To bend it back fiat and motionless against the
:screen is then the work of an instant ;
subdued, it takes the
proper form and leaves come apparently spontaneously upon the
.stalk.
The raisoii d'etre of the recollectivc bending back seems clear.
I " am, as spectator of the retinal screen, behind the eyes,
situated with " my back to my head. " I " have tried, as
it were, sitting sideways, to watch the screen and recollect the
rose form at the same time. An oscillation from one to the
.other is at once experienced. One can attend subconsciously-
iinconsciously, but one cannot, I think, consciously partly distract
one's attention.
When objects are clearly visualised at night I lose sight or
consciousness of the background. But I think when the visual-
ising apparatus is in full swing and the mind is wholly given to
it, the background becomes luminous ; because at a sudden noise
everything seems to vanish instantaneously in a phosphorescent
flash. Light dreams (i.e. in light sleep), from which I have been
similarly awakened, appear similarly to have been experienced
.against a luminous background.

II. On " Headsnaps."
To the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.
Madam,—In the Journal for January, p. 6, I see some accounts
of " Head-snaps " occurring after or at the end of trances or
sleep. Surely these as described must be mild forms of what
are known as nocturnal bombs, well known to many people.
They usually take this form : after falling asleep for a few
minutes, one is suddenly aroused by a flash of light like tlie
explosion of a bomb in the room, apparently sufficiently bright
to light up everything in the room, accompanied by the sound
of an explosion, and instantaneously one falls into a dead
sleep. A mild form of this may be compared to a door
shutting. An account of this phenomenon appears in an article

Disorders of Sleep " by Dr, J. T. Murray Robertson in the
Journal of the Straits Medical Association, No. 4 (1894), p. 19.
He writes: "Another phenomenon of sleep or its borders, and
also in the sensory sphere, is what has been described as sensory
shock. Hughlings Jackson has written about it. In the prae-
somnic state of fading sensation, but never on waking from sleep,
the patient has in his head a sudden and violent sensation, and
the forms it assumes may be classified thus :
(1) In the sphere
of general sensation he feels as if struck, or that a bolt has been
driven through the head ; (2) auditory, a loud noise like that
of a pistol shot, or as if a broken glass, or a bell or a wire
sharply twanged ; (3) visual, a flash of light ; (4) olfactory, a
sudden sense of an odour ; (5) emotional, abrupt sense of fear,
sometimes preceding, sometimes following, the sensory shock."
He also mentions sleep jerks :
" We all have had the common
experience of a sudden jerk of the body as we were falling
asleep." Though he states that the sensory shocks do not occur
on wakening, for the second or so after the explosion one is or
feels quite awake, and on one occasion in the daytime I found
what I had suspected, that the explosion was accompanied by a
violent convulsive jerk, and on that occasion managed to wake
up completely.
As these explosions generally occur on two or three or more
nights in succession, generally diminishing in violence, it seems
most improbable that they are due to the sudden uniting of
nerve centres or breakdown of some inhibitory obstacle or a
sudden change in blood pressure as suggested by Oliver Lodge,
but rather in some form of violent and spasmodic nerve impulse
in the brain. Murray-Robertson states :
" These symptoms are
found in some neurasthenics in hysteria and most commonly in
men too much addicted to tobacco smoking. The analogy to
epilepsy is close."
H. N. Ridley.
{A feiv days after receiving Mr. Ridley's letter ive received
from one of our members, Miss Wilkinson, an account of her
personal experience, tvhich is of very much the kind that Mr.
Ridley describes. We print her letter below.)
I am much interested in the correspondence on " head-snaps."
I wonder if any other correspondents have had my experience.

namely : a sort of crack in my head just as I am falling asleep.
This occurs sometimes for several nights consecutively, and then
perhaps not again for some time. It always wakes me up very
distinctly. As far as I know these have no psychic connection.

III. Brain and Speech.
To the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.
Madam,—In Mrs. M'Connel's letter, published in the Jourml
for January, 1925, occurs a passage which interested me very much,
and which I have thought about for a long time, myself. It is :
• . .
" Memories which are capable of being put into pictorial form,
or words which have already been uttered or written, are the
most easy of communication."
Now, in my Problems of Psychical Research (English ed., p. 371),
in speaking of the curious behaviour of the Ouija Board, on a
certain occasion, I said
:
" It certainly appeared far easier for the board to point
to letters than to write—and this is most suggestive and
interesting when we consider it. It would seem to indicate
that the '
controlling intelligence '
found it easier to convey
its thoughts when the letters were before it, in plain sight
—a suggestive fact, taken in conjunction with certain medium-
istic phenomena. ... I have in mind especially one remarkable
(but hitherto unpubhshed) experiment with Mrs. Piper. A
certain lady of my acquaintance—an old Piper sitter—had tried
to convey a certain word to '
Rector ' telepathically, to be
given by automatic writing through the trance. Several
attempts failed. Finally, one day, the lady in question wrote
out the word on a blackboard, and sat looking at it for
about haK an hour. The word was given the next day
through Mrs. Piper. The blackboard was in the lady's own
house, distant some 800 miles from Mrs. Piper, in Boston.
This certainly seems to show that there is a peculiar '
magic
'
in thoughts or things that are objectified in this manner.
It served to explain why it is that many clairvoyants cannot
read thoughts and cjuestions until written out on paper. ..."

IV. A COREECTIOX CONCERNTNG THE " LiFE OF CrOOKES."
To the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.K.
Madam,—In Proceedings, Part XCIL, page 315, I reviewed the
Life of Crookes, and make a gratuitous reference to a book of
Dr. Fournier d'Albe's in which are quoted some extracts from
There is No Death, by Mrs. Ross Church (Florence Marryat),
—
among them an incident the experience of which Crookes had
denied ; and I gave a reference to Crookes's denial in Journal
S.P.R. XII., page 268, though inadvertently I said Proceedings.
The denial however is not to any statement made by Mrs. Ross
Church herself, but to a reproduction from her book of an account
of a vivid deniaterialisation episode in the Annales des Sciences
Psychiques for 1906, where unfortunately it is cited as if on the
aiithority of Sir William Crookes, instead of on the authority of
Miss Florence Marryat. Crookes denies having seen anything of
the sort : he does not express any opinion about the testimony
of someone else. Hence that testimony remains unaffected by
his denial. I regret that I did not get this matter right at
first : for in that case I need not have referred to Mrs. Ross
Church's book at all. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has kindly called
my attention to the misunderstanding.
Oliver Lodge.
NOTES ON PERIODICALS.
In December 1924 a series of articles was concluded in The Ttvo
Worlds which commenced on October 10th. The author, Mr.
Leslie Curnow, deals with the physical phenomena of the past and
the articles constitute a valuable sketch of mediumistic activity
in this direction from 1848. Many references are given to con-
temporary literature and accounts are printed of the phenomena
said to occur in the presence of mediums whose names are now
forgotten except by those who interest themselves in the histori-
cal growth of spiritualism. The Journal of the American Society
for Psychical Research for March contains an account of the
" Margery " Case, partly by Drs. Crandon and Richardson, and
partly a reprint of the report of Mr. Dingwall's lecture in Boston
on January 31, 1925, which was published in the [Boston]
Banner of Life for February 7, 1925.

The 83rd Private Meeting for Members and Associates was held

A paper entitled " Cryptesthesia versus Survival : An Enquiry
into a Remarkable Case " was read by Sir William Barrett
;
a discussion followed in which Sir Oliver Lodge, Mr. Trethewy
and others took part.
AN ENQUIRY INTO A "HAUNTED HOUSE."
We print below a report of an enquiry into an alleged case of
haimting, carried out by two members of this Society, by
arrangement with the Secretary and at the request of the
tenant of the house in question, whom we will here call Miss
Robinson.
It appears to be clearly estabhshed that the most definite
and persistent feature of the " haunting " was entirely due to
a normal, but obscure, physical cause, and the case is for that
reason instructive. In view of the fact that as stated by Miss
Robinson (see below) some disturbance continued after this
physical cause had been removed, it cannot be held as proved
that this cause was the only one involved. Since Miss Robinson
84 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Junk, 1925
gave up her tenancv of the house very shortly after the en-
quiry took place, no further enquiry was for the moment
possible. We hope, however, that if the new tenant should
experience any disturbance, the Society will be informed.
The two members of the Society by whom the enquiry was
carried out were Mr. G. W. Lambert and Mr. G. W. Hayley.
Mr. Lambert's report, corroborated by Mr. Hayley, is as follows :
EEPORT OF INVESTIGATION AT CHELSEA, S.W.3.
On 3rd February, 1925, under arrangement made by the Secre-
tary of the S.P.E., I visited this house, taking with me Mr. G.
W. Hayley, also of the S.P.R., to enquire into some disturbances
there, apparently " psychic " in origin. We arrived at about
10.30 p.m., and heard accounts (in the following order) of the
phenomena complained of. The accounts are compiled from brief
notes taken at the time :
1. Matilda W ,
aged 19, maidservant, heard slight taps in
I)ack room on ground floor (used as Miss Robinsons bedroom) ;
tapping had been occurring on and off since last Friday (Jan.
30th) ; heard in early morning (7 a.m.) and afternoon ; occurred
while she was alone as well as in presence of Miss R . (Miss
Jl tapped a china Madonna on the chest of drawers in the
room in question and the maid assented that the noise was like
that.) The taps seemed to come from different parts of the room.
2. Miss N. Robinson (tenant of the house) said she had lived in
the house since September, 1923. The maid (M. W ) had been
with her all the time. Before she (Miss R ) came to the
Jiouse, she had had various uncanny experiences, from 3 years of
a'^e (recounted) ; had felt uncomfortable since coming to the house
,
and had been conscious of something on the stairs. Disturbances
h xd commenced since Christmas ;
(a) on one night there was an
unexplained movement of two curtain rings on curtain pole in
ludroom ;
(b) on Friday, Jan. 23rd (when visitors were present)
there was a scuffling noise on stairs between 12 and 1, cause not
ascertainable ;
(c) Friday, Jan. 30th, tapping noises in bedroom so
bad that she moved her bed to (front) sitting room ;
(d) Feb. 2nd,
scuffling noise about 10 p.m. A friend, Mr. M , came in late
and eventually stayed night.
3. Mr. M (just referred to) slept upstairs, two flights up, in
room next but one above the " disturbed " bedroom. Before
I
j0NE, 1925 Enquiry into a " Haunted House " 85
going to sleep lie said he heard sound outside door like glass
pendants (of a chandelier) being knocked together. Next morning
early (by daylight through curtain) saw a grey column in corner
of his bedroom. It was opaque and reached from floor nearly to
ceiling : sat up and looked at it : it persisted an appreciable time.
He turned over and when he next looked it had gone.
(Mr. M—— left shortly after giving his account.)
I then went to make notes in sitting room (with G. W. H.),
and Miss R went to sit in bedroom to see if noises would
start. She shortly after fetched us to the room. Almost at once
I heard a distinct " tick," then others in twos and threes at
irregular intervals. They continued, whether Miss R was in
the f
room or not, whether the light was on or not. They were
very difficult to locate exactly, but seemed to come from the
direction E-P on attached (rough) plan. They were all the same
quality—somewhat metallic. Miss R thought they came from
region of Madonna on the chest of drawers ('' 0 " on plan).
Outside window (W3) there was a constant drip into the area
from an overflow pipe higher up. The drip coidd be heard falling
on to paving of area when the window was open, but the drip
was fairly constant and did not synchronise with the " taps,"
moreover it was some distance from the apparent source of the
sounds in the bedroom, and differed from them in quality.
Eventually we discovered that there was a gas pipe (supplying
the gas fire in the bedroom) which ran outside the house parallel
with the wall, and at a few inches distance from it (to clear some
stack pipes). It then turned at right angles, went through a
square hole in the brickwork without touching it. After that it
presi-mably followed under the floor the dotted line shown in plan.
At point X this pipe was in a position to be struck by some of
the drips from the overflow above. The vibrations thus set up
travelled along the pipe apparently to one or more points where
it touched the floor of the room, the floor acting as a sort of
sounding board. The angle at F would be just underneath the
Madonna from the region of which some of the sounds came.
We tested the matter thus. I tapped the pipe gently with a
pen-knife at a point outside the Jiouse and Miss R and
G. W. H. heard sounds of exactly the same quality as the " taps
"
already heard. Gr. W. H. and I then exchanged places. He
tapped the pipe at the exact place where the drips had been
86 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1925
falling on it, and I (standing in the room) could hear taps appar-
ently coming from under the chest of drawers. The " direct
"
sound of the tap on the pipe could not be heard in the room,
and if listened for out of the window was quite different in
quality.

The tapping noise was the only occurrence of which CI. W. H.
and I had personal experience, and we were both satisfied that it
was caused in the manner indicated above.

This is a correct account of the events told and occurring here

Febniary 9, 1925.
On February 5, 1925, Miss Robinson wrote to the Secretary,
jVIiss Newton, as follows :
Chelsea, S.W. 3.
Feb. oth, 1925.
1 have returned to my own bedroom, and last night was
wakened twice by groanings and shufflings in the room, and this
jnorning a glass-like bell has rung twice between 9 and 10.30.
I will let you know of any other disturbances which may occur
here before I leave the house and will not tell my tenants about
.anything, except the diip from the water pipe.
N. [Kobinson].
Subsequently a further report was received from Miss Robinson,
as follows :
Thursday, February 5th.
Last night I slept again in my own bedroom—having muffled
"the drip on the gas-pipe. At 3 a.m. I was awakened by a loud
groaning close to my bed. I turned on the light and read for
some time. When I turned it off again the groaning was repeated
three or four times. I fell asleep about 6.30.
In the evening six or seven people came in after dinner and
stayed till midnight. R M arrived later and stayed on
tm 1 a.m. After she had gone I remained up for half-an-houi
setting things in order. Just before going to bed I heard a loud
crash in the haU. I was the only person in the house below the
second floor. I went to examine the court. Nothing had fallen
or was broken in the house and no doors or windows were open.
Saturday, February 7th.
I came in from visiting several Private Views at 3.30 to-dav,
having left the house at 11. My maid, Matilda W , had made
.up the dining-room fire shortly after my secretary had left for the
88 Journal of Society for PsycJiical Research June, 1925
day at 1.45. At that time all was normal in the dining-room.
Matilda W let me in and we went together into the dining-
room. Two Staffordshire poodles which had belonged to my great-
aunt and a small Chelsea figure had been removed from the shelf
where they usually stand and were ranged on the lid of a box-
table by the fire-place. No one had entered the room after
Matilda W had made up the fire at 1.45 until we went in
together at 3.30.
Tuesday, February 10th.
This morning between 12 and 1 I went upstairs to do some
writing in the room on the 2nd floor in which E. M. had slept
on February Ist.^ After I had been there for half-an-hour a loud
knocking produced itself in the middle of the room. No one was
in the room above, and the room below had been empty and un-
furnished since September.

Mr. M. slept in this room, but the jjoint is of no importance.
CASE.
P. 295. A Peemonitoey Hallucination.
We print below a report of an apparently premonitory hallu-
cination experienced whilst playing roulette. A first report of
the incident was received from Mrs. Boustead, the mother of
the percipient and a Member of this Society. Mrs. Boustead
wrote to the Secretary thus :
5th January, 1925.
My son and his wife have been staying with me and playing
roulette in the Casino a good deal. The other day they had been
playing at one of the numerous tables there and had lost and
decided to go home—but in j^assing out, my son stopped at one
table near the door and his wife wandered over to another. My
son idly watched the play. One " coup " or throw was just over,
and the ball lay in the winning number. I don't know if you
know roulette, but in case anyone doesn't, I may explain that the
wheel has 36 numbers round it and these numbers are represented
on the table itself by corresponding numbers painted on the cloth,
and if you wish to stake your money on any one number you
June, 1925 Case : A Premonitory Hallucination 89*
place it on that one and it is called en plein, and should it come-
up you get paid 35 times your stake, as there are of course 35
chances against you.
Well, he was standing there, looking at the wheel and the ball
lying in the last winning number, when he saw a second ball (the
balls are always white) at the ojjposite side of the wheel, lying in
number 34. Very much puzzled, for there is never more than one
ball used, he looked more closely and then became aware that
this second ball had something different about it to the other..
The edges of it were faintly blurred, although it was perfectly
distinct. He shut his eyes and opened them again, and it was
still there in number 34, and after a minute or so it vanished.
He then began to realize that he must have had an occult vision
of some sort, and his wife approaching the table at that minute
he told her about it. She begged him to stake on 34 imme-
diately, and taking all he had left in liis pocket out (which was
not much) he put it on 34 en plein—and sure enough up it came !'
The incident can be vouched for by his wife—to whom as I say
he told it to, hefore the next throw. Unfortunately I was not
there, nor at the moment, anyone else we know, but should you
consider the facts evidential enough to publish, my son and his
wife are both ready to reply to any inquiries you may make.
Leila Boustead.
On January 10th, 1925, the Secretary, jVIiss Newton, wrote
to ]\Ir. Cedric Boustead, asking if he would send an account
of his experience wdth a corroborative statement from his wife.
In the course of the letter she put the following questions :
(1) Have you ever had a similar experience ? Or any other
experience of a psychical nature ?
(2) Do you remember any other occasion when 34 was the
winning number ?
(3) . Most people have two or three special numbers which in-
variably occur to them in experiments and games in which num-
ber forms are used. Is this your experience. And, if so, does
34 happen to be one of your numbers ?
To this letter Mr. Boustead replied as follows on January
18th, 1925:
The experience I had at Monte Carlo was as follows :
My wife and I had been plapng in the Salle Privee one after-
90 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June, 1925
noon without any success and decided to go back to the Hotel
for some tea. On the way out one has to pass through the
" Kitchen " (several rooms known by this name) and on glancing at
•one of the tables I saw to my surprise two balls in the wheel.
I went closer to see what was the matter, and immediately
realised that one ball was the real one whilst the other was
obviously a ball of my imagination, that is to say, the ball, al-
though exactly like the real one, was blurred and would not come
into focus. The phantom ball, if I may call it such, was lying
in either number 34 or number 6, but as the wheel was still re-
volving I could not be certain which, although I was almost
certain it was number 34. (I might explain here that 34 and 6
are next to each other on the roulette wheel.) I stared at this
phantom ball in utter amazement for at least five seconds, when
it quite suddenly vanished, upon which I walked over to my wife
who was standing about ten yards away and said :
" The most
extraordinary thing has just happened. I have just seen two balls
in that v/heel, and one of them was a phantom ball and was
lying in number 34 or 6, I'm not quite certain which, but I think
number 34." She laughed and replied, " Then for heaven's sake
back both." I then walked back to the end of the table and
handed the croupier some money and told him to put half of it
on number 34 and the other half on number 6. The spinner by
this time was calling " Faites vos jeux" and had spun the ball.
I then walked round behind the wheel to watch the result, and
after a few seconds the ball fell into No. 34 and I had won !
Now to reply to your three questions :
1. I have never had a similar experience, although I have had
one or two rather curious experiences, but which might easUy be
put down to ordinary coincidence, but none of those happened at
Monte Carlo.
2. It is impossible to play roulette for any length of time with-
out having all the numbers turn up sooner or later—not once but
many times.
3. No. 34 was not my lucky number and I seldom backed it
—
Zero being my favourite number.
There seems to me to be only two possible explanations to this
experience :
1. That the phantom ball was simply a reflection of the real
ball, which is highly improbable, as the real ball was the other
-Joke, 1925 Case : A Premonitory Hallucination 91
side of the wheel, and I stared hard at the phantom ball before
it disappeared.
2. That it was some form of psychic phenomena.
If the experience had happened after dinner I might well be
accused of having dined not wisely but too well ! but the incident
"took place at about 4 p.m.
Needless to say I looked for phantom balls for the rest of my
.stay at Monte but without success.
C. BOUSTEAD.
On January 26th, 1925, Mrs. Cedric Boustead sent a corroborative
statement, as follows :
With reference to your letter asking for a corroborative account
•of my husband's pecuhar experience at Monte Carlo it was as
follows : We had been playing in the early afternoon at roulette
in the Salle Privee of the Casino, and having lost a certain amount
of money agreed to return to the hotel to tea. As we were
passing through the Salle Schmidt, commonly known as the
Kitchen, Avhere one can play in 10 franc stakes, my husband
stopped at the first roulette table while I walked on to the first
Trente et Quarante table. I heard him call me and walked back,
when he told me in a great state of excitement that he had just
seen two balls in the roulette wheel which was slowing up after
the coup. He said that one was the real bail and the other
obviously a phantasm, and that the phantom ball was between 6
and 34, which numbers lie adjacent on the wheel. I told him to
back both numbers for the following coup, which he was just in
time to do, and sure enough 34 was the winning number. As far
as I am aware 34 has never been a favourite number of his. He
was exceedingly definite about having seen the second ball stop
where it was lying. I shall be glad to give you any information
further than this account which you may require.

WHAT IS WRONG WITH TELEPATHY ?
The attention so justly excited by Prof. Gilbert Murray's experi-
ments and by Lord Balfour's endorsement of them has led to a
prolonged discussion of the subject of telepathy in the public
press, to which Dr. Thoiiless's letter to the Manchester Guardian,
reprinted in the April Journal, was a most valuable contribution. I
92 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jdne, 1925
am glad that it has been brought to the notice of members of
the Society, and am tempted to improve the occasion further.
For really the situation is most instructive, and has vividly brought
out the weak points in the position of believers and of disbelievers
in telepathy alike.
I shall most fitly begin by commenting on the foibles of the
latter. Messrs. Ray Lankester and Bryan Donkin are of course-
free to disbelieve in telepathy, as no one contends that the evi-
dence for it is coercive ; but they should concede a right to-
believe in it to those to whom it S66inS Sufficient. Instead of
which, in their attacks on Lord Balfour in the Times, they show^
themselves the faithful pupils of W. K. Clifford. It was from
him, many years ago, that they learnt the ine Sable turpitude of
letting belief outstrip knowledge, and yet they themselves also-
appear to believe that they can 'prove the beliefs which they
cherish. They identify science with dogma, and will allow nO'
one to question the infallibility of what was scientific orthodoxy
forty or fifty years ago. So they seem blissfully unaware of the-
results of modern reflection on the theory and methods of science,,
and seem strange survivals in an age which has dethroned Newton
for Einstein, and through its scientific leaders declares that a
scientific doctrine is a policy and not a creed ! Moreover, it is
now nearly thirty years ago that William James explained to u&
the nature and functions of the will to believe, and discredited the
ideal of a purely intellectualist method of knowing.
Sir Herbert Stephen at first sight appears to hajk back to a
still more antiquated attitude. He seems to question the validity
of pure science itself, and to reject the existence of telepathy,
becaiise it has been under investigation for thirty years, and has
not yet superseded the more ordinary modes of communication
between minds. So he infers that " it will n(,\^er be of solid or
enduring use to human beings," and that " fov all practical pur-
poses there is no such thing." It is intelligibh; that such appar-
ently Philistine and obscurantist sentiments i.hould have pro-
voked a rebuke from Sir Oliver Lodge in Nature for May 9.
Other disbelievers have appealed to Prof. Coover's researches as
proof positive that there is nothing in telepathy, although, as I
think I chowed in my review of his book in Proceedings, Part
LXXVL, this is by no means the only possible interpretation of
Prof. Coo\er's evidence. Still it is clear that the case for tele-
June, 1925 What is Wrong ivith Telepathy ? 93
pathy does not y( fc carry conviction to several distinct types of
mind.
It is natural therefore to ask who is to blame for this deplorable
situation, and diflS-ult to acquit the advocates of telepathy of
contributing to it. For it is unfortunately true that they have
not yet obtained experimental control over the phenomenon. It
may well be, of course, that no phenomenon into which a
psychological fact )r enters can ever exhibit simply mechanical
xegularity ; but at present the success of a telepathic experiment
cannot be anticipated with anything like such confidence as the
strokes of an expert player of any game.
Sir Herbert Stephen therefore is quite justified in saying that
telepathy is not of any practical use. He is right also in holding
that this practical defect has a bearing on its theoretic truth.
For it very much affects belief. If telepathic phenomena were
controllable, and common, and trustworthy in ordinary life, it
would not be possible to persist in an attitude of disbelief towa^rds
them. Thus, though no one knows what electricity is, no one
hesitates to use it on this account. What, therefore, Sir Herbert
Stephen is really urging is that the belief in telepathy is not
confirmed pragmatically, i.e. by its working. It is not yet able
to stand the pragmatic test. But inchoate truths never can. If
it had got so far as to stand it, the dispute about it would cease ;
for it would not be worth any one's while to deny the truth of
what would have become a very useful and important means of
communication between minds. Sir Herbert Stephen is wrong only
in assuming that because telepathy is not working at present, it
never will be got to Tork. For the history of science shows that
many of the force*? of nature have remained obscure, disputable
And useless for centuries, and then been established as true, useful
and important.
To render telepathy useful, therefore, by discovering how to
control the conditions of its occurrence, is the most convincing
way of establishing its truth. For it is the only way of over-
coming prejudices which will never yield to argument, nor to the
report of experiments which the objectors have not seen, and will
not observe. And it should be the chief concern of those who
already believe in telepathy as a scientific fact to make it also a
practical success.
In saying this I do not underrate the difiiculties of their task.
94 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June, 1925
For the truth is that in no matters of psychology have we yet
attained a scientifically fruitful method of inquiry. Psychologists
have laboured, long and arduously, under the impression that, by
imitatiog the methods which the physical sciences hit upon after
many centuries of failure, tliey could obtain a guarantee of scien-
tific success. After fifty years of experimentation on these lines,,
pursued by crowds of highly trained experts in expensive labora-
tories, it is pretty clear that this belief has proved illusory. The
most successful method of operating on the human soul at present
appears to be that of " psycho-analysis," which does not employ
the assumptions of physics but, in spite of the gravest theoretic
and moral objections, seems to be efficacious in a considerable
percentage of the cases so treated. Psychical researchers are'
conducting psychological explorations in a different direction, with
far too exiguous resources in men and equipment, and a corre-
spondingly modest measure of success. But if they have the faith
to persevere, they may yet be rewarded by rendering indisputable
discoveries which must revolutionize man's outlook upon life. At
the moment, moreover, we have one line of inquiry which can
employ the experimental test. I refer to the suggestion that Prof.
Murray's results are due to auditory hyperaesthesia. As Dr.
Thouless has pointed out, hyperaesthesia would be a physical fact,
and its processes should conform to known physical la.ws. Let
experiments therefore be made with Prof. Murray's auditory appa-
ratus. Let us ascertain how far he can hear, and under what
conditions : for possibly, with the aid of a microphone, he may be
able to hear whispers all over the house ! I dare not add, let
Sir Eay Lankester and Sir Bryan Donkin themselves conduct these
experiments : for if they had desired to investigate, they would
no doubt have done so (like Prof. Lehmann, with his theory of
" unconscious whispering ") before alleging hyperaesthesia in a
merely dialectical vvay.

CORRESPONDENCE.
To the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.
Madam,—The neAvspaper test reported in the Journal for February,
1925, by Pvev. C. Drayton Thomas brings to a focus a point that
has occurred before but which has, I believe, never i-eceived the-
June, 1925 C07'respondence 95-
attention that it deserves—the transmission bv sound-content of
names as between the "communicator" and the "control."
As I understand it we have two telephonists each in call boxes
—at one end the " control " and at the other the " automatist."
Shouting messages to the former from outside the box is the
" communicator," and outside the receiving box is the sitter to
whom messages are shouted by the " automatist " in the box.
Now the normal surroundings of the automatist and sitter lead to
transmission of ideas by sound since speech is our ordinary means
of communication here below. It is intelligible that even where
speech is not actually in use these minds may be so accustomed
to register sound values that they automatically find them the
easiest means of expression.
But with regard to the pair who operate from "another place"
such information as we have leads to the beUef that conversation
is not carried out by speech, nor by any analogous representation
of ideas by an arbitrary code, but by direct transmission of the
concepts themselves from mind to mind. How then are we to
explain cases where misconceptions seem to arise as between the
communicator and the control in form such as would correspond
to conversation between them by speech (under difficulties) in
the English language.
Unless some satisfactory explanation is forthcoming the fact of
such misconceptions occurring would seem to point to their origin
in minds habituated to English speech ; that is to say would be
an argument against the genuineness of the phenomena.

endeavours to bring the luminous phenomena reported at seances,

96 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June, 1925
•elsewliere in nature, and in particular explains Reichenbach's " odic
lays " by some experiments made in 1914 in the physical labora-
tory of Vienna University by a physicist, Prof. E. Haschek, and
a medical man, Dr. F. Winkler, and reported by them to the
Vienna Academy of Sciences. It seems that eyes thoroughly
adapted to the dark room perceived luminescence round a horse-
shoe magnet, but not round a much stronger electro-magnet, the
explanation being that the lacquer covering of the former phos-
phoresced in the dark. Also it was found that the human body
was in fact visible in total darkness. At a distance of two milli-
metres Prof. Haschek could still count the number of fingers
extended on a hand. This was explained by the facts that fatty
acids are present in the skin, and grow chemically luminous when
oxydizing in the air. This hypothesis was verified by a number
•of experiments, such as that the light was extinguished by an
atmosphere of carbonic acid and was intensified by ozone. It seems
very desirable that these interesting and important experiments
should be repeated in other labora,tories ;
for, though there seems
no reason to doubt the explanation given, the case of Blondlot's
N-rays shows that even eminent physicists are at times capable of
seeing things that aren't there !
The second pamphlet is written by a Vienna doctor who prac-
tises " magnetic " healing and believes that there is a specific
" magnetic " force radiating from the human body. The account
•of his cases is interesting, but has to be taken on trust, and it
is as well that Dr. Tartaruga in his introduction to the lecture
should take occasion to refer to the experiments of other inquirers,
like Dr. Akutz, who have brought forward evidence ol the objec-
tivity of a human radiation.

CASES.
I.
L. 1266. An Apparition Seen Shortly apter Death.
The report which we print below was sent to us by Mrs.
Walter Shadwell who is a Member of the Society and a daughter
of Mrs. A. V. Thornton, by whom the apparition was seen.
The case is an old one, having occurred in 1913, but we are
able to print a statement by the percipient (with a corrobora-
July, 1925 Cases 99
tive statement by the principal witness), whicli was written
within a few weeks of the occurrence.
The case was first brought to our notice in a letter from Mrs.
Shadwell to the Secretary, Miss Newton, thus :
March 22, 1925.
I have an account written by my mother, Nov. 19th, 1913,
and corroborated by my eldest brother, Nov. 23rd, 1913, of an
appearance to her of my father who died Oct. 19th 1913. My
father was Canon A. V. Thornton, Chaplain of S. Edward's,
Cambridge, and died suddenly during evensong on Sunday, Oct.
19th. I could give names of people in Cambridge who knew him
and would remember the event. I have newspaper cuttings and
the Cambridge Review of Oct. 23, 1913, mentioning it . . . My
mother died soon after my father. She never had any experience
of the sort before. The points of interest about the apparition are :
(1) She was very short-sighted and was wearing reading-glasses
at the time and saw the figure as she would see a real figure,
no more clearly, but quite recognisable by outhne as any real
person would have been to her.
(2) My father died in his cassock—a fact unkuowji to her when
she saw the figure, and she remarked to us, vv^hen she was telling
the stor)', " I can't think v/hat he can have had on—a long black
robe it looked like." I then told her of the cassock. The verger
of S. Edward's, if he is still alive, might remember helping my
father to take off his surplice.
(3) The absence of fear or even surprise which the appearance
might have occasioned. She did not wait to see it disappear
—
merely turned round and put out the light . . .

We give below Mrs. Thornton's original statement, dated
November 19, 1913, and a corroborative statement by her son
Mr. Hugh C. Thornton, C.M.G., C.V.O., dated November
23, 1913.
A Vision.
I.
On the evening of October 20th, 1913, between ten and eleven,
I was lying in bed at Duff House, Banff. I had arrived there
on the evening of the 17th, and intended staying two or three
weeks for medical treatment. The room was in darkness save
100 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1925
for the heavily-shaded electric lamp on the table at the left side
of the bed.
I was lying on my left side, reading a novel, when the feeling
of a presence in the room made me turn on my back. There
standing at the bottom of the bed on the right side was a figure.
I thought I saw the head and shoulders of a man outlined against
the white wall-paper and clothed in a long and shapeless black
garment. I could see no face, owing I thought to my short
sight, but the shape of the head and shoulders was, I believed,
that of my husband, and I felt no doubt at all that it was he.
He gazed at me and I gazed at him for some seconds. I remember
wondering what he had got on, and said to myself, " Well, if
I were an imaginative person, I could make a good story of this,"^
and turning round again I put out the light and went to sleep.
The next morning Dr. Spriggs came to break the news to me
that my husband had died suddenly while doing duty at St.
Edward's Church, Cambridge, on Sunday evening, Oct. 19tli, and
at about 10 a.m. my son Hugh arrived to fetch me home. It
was not till after his arrival that I remembered my vision and I
at once told him of it. It was not till we got back to Cambridge
on Wednesday evening that I heard the exact details of his death.
During the singing of the " Magnificat " he had felt ill, and saying
to a member of the congregation, " I can do no more. Fetch the
verger," he walked by himself to the vestry. There he said, "Take
oiJ my surplice," and helping to take it off himseU, he sank to
the ground, where he almost immediately expired. He died
therefore in his cassock, and the long shapeless black garment of
the vision is explained.
It is my own attitude of mind which is to me so extraordinary.
I was neither alarmed nor excited nor even particularly interested.
It never occurred to me that it might portend death or illness,
though I had been anxiously expecting a letter that Monday
evening to tell me how he had got through the Sunday. It
seems as though he came to reassure me that all was really well
and to say that though I would hear of his death in the morning,
I should have this vision of him to comfort me in place of the
leave-taking which I had missed—at any rate this was the effect
it had.

July, 1925 Cases 101
II.
On Monday, October 20th, 1913, I received a letter at about
8 a.m. from Mr. P , the churchwarden of St. Edward's,
Cambridge, informing me that my father had died the previous
evening in the vestry of St. Edward's during evening service.
The letter gave me no further details of his death. He told me,
however, that my sister Dorothea wished me to leave at once
for Duff House, Banff, to bring my mother back to Cambridge.
I accordingly left London at once by the ten o'clock train from
King's Cross. At Edinburgh station I bought a local evening
paper in which I found a paragraph announcing my father's death.
No details, however, were given, except that he died in the
vestry of St. Edward's during the evening service.
I arrived at Banff on the morning of Tuesday, October 21st,
and at once saw Dr. Spriggs. I had arranged by telephone with
Dr. Spriggs beforehand that he should break the news to my
mother about one hour before my arrival. My conversation on
the telephone with him took place from Aberdeen on the night
of Monday, Oct. 20th. Dr. Spriggs asked me whether I knew any
details which he could tell my mother. I told him that all I knew
was that he had died in the vestry of the church during service.
I saw my mother a few minutes after my arrival at Banff
on the Tuesday morning. She immediately asked whether I
knew any details. I told her I knew nothing except what Dr.
Spriggs had already told her. I then shewed her Mr. P 's letter.
Very shortly afterwards my mother told me that she had seen
a vision of my father whilst lying in bed. I am not absolutely
sure whether she said she saw it on the Sunday or the Blonday
night. I am, however, almost sure she said it was on the
Monday night. My reason for thinking it was Monday and not
Sunday is that I have a sort of recollection that she expressed
some surprise that it should have been on the Monday because
(as I think she told me), she was thinking a great deal on
Sunday evening about my father and was wondering how he was
getting through the service. I will try to give, as far as I can
remember, the exact words which my mother used in describing
her experience to me :
" I was lying in bed about 10 o'clock reading a book.
I turned round on my other side and saw a figure standing
102 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July. 1925
by my bed. I had no doubt whatever that it was daddy.
I could see his head and shoulders quite clearly, but I could
not make out the features of his face. The rest of the
figure was undefined but it looked as if he Avas wearing some
kind of a robe. I looked at the figure for some moments
and then turned round and put out the light to go to sleep."
I do not remember my mother telling me that the figure was
clotted in a black robe, but she may, of course, have done so.
My mother also told me that at the time of the vision or just
afterwards she said to herself : "If I were an imaginative person
I could make a very good story out of this."
(Signed) Hugh C. Thornton.
Nov. 23rd, 1913.
With, these statements were enclosed a statement from Miss
Dorothea M. Thornton, who was at Cambridge at the time of
Canon Thornton's death, and a further statement from Mrs.
Shadwell. These w^e print below.
(i.)
April 6th, 1925.
To the best of my recollection my mother told me two or three
days after her return to Cambridge, that on the Sunday or Monday
night (I think the Monday but cannot be sure), as she lay in
bed reading by an electric light near the bed which was so
shaded as to concentrate the light on her book and leave little
light in the rest of the room, something made her turn right
round in bed and she then saw my father on the dark side of
the bed, looking at her.
He did not speak, but gave her such a strong impression of
happiness and calmness that she thought "All is well with him,"
and felt distinctly happier.
Dorothea M. Thornton.
(ii.)
1th April, 1925.
My husband and I were staying with his brother, Dr. C. L.
Shadwell, at the Provost's Lodgings, Oriel College, Oxford, when
Mr. Parker's letter arrived telling my husband of my father's
death in church at evensong—no details were given.
My husband and I went to Cambridge the day before the
July. 192.3 Cases 103
funeral and were at Lynton, Huntington Road, Cambridge (my
parents' house), when my mother and eldest brother arrived from
Scotland. As we were in the drawing-room at tea (my mother
stiU in her outdoor things and not having had any talk with my
sister Dorothea), my mother said, " If I were one of these psychic
people I should say I had seen a spirit. I was in bed at the
Clinic, about 10 o'clock reading—I can't remember if it was
Sunday or Monday night but anyhow it was before Hugh came
—
I saw a irgure standing at the foot of the bed—I had my reading
glasses on but recognised him by outline and I thought, '
Why,
there's daddy—whatever has he got on—a long black robe ' and
then I turned round and put out the light. I don't know what
he can have had on
—
"
I then said, " He died in his cassock."
Ethel R. H. Shadwell.
We have also received from Mrs. Shadwell some newspaper
cuttings giving an account of Canon Thornton's death, from which
we print the following extract, taken from the Cambridge
Chronicle of October 24, 1913 :
It is with deep regret that we record the death of Canon
Thornton, Chaplain of St. Edward's Church, Cambridge, who died
on Sunday during the evening service. For a considerable period
the state of health of Canon Thornton has been the source of the
greatest anxiety, and disease of the heart has frequently prevented
him from giving attention to his clerical duties. Death ensued in
a tragic manner. He prepared to take the evening service and
read the First Lesson. During the singing of the Magnificat he
sat down and towards the close of the Chant he slowly walked
to the vestry, accompanied by the verger. Iii the vestry he
removed his surplice and lay down on the floor, requesting the
verger to stop the service. Dr. Ellis, who was in the church,
was called, and other medical assistance was summoned, but
death supervened almost immediately.
It will be noticed that in Mr. Hugh Thornton's statement
he says that he telephoned to Dr. Spriggs (at the nursing
home where Mrs. Thornton was staying), from Aberdeen on
his way to Banff. The train by which he travelled would
reach Aberdeen about 10 p.m. and it seems therefore that
104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 3925
the news of Canon Thornton's death was received at the
nursing home within a short time of the hour at which Mrs.
Thornton had her experience " between ten and eleven " in
the evening, but whether shortly before or shortly after it
is not possible to ascertain. It is clear that at the time of
the apparition Mrs. Thornton had no normal knowledge of
her husband's death.
II.
L. 1267. A Veridical Statement obtained at a Trance-Sitting.
AVe print below a report of a case in which a veridical
statement was made at a sitting concerning a recent event
of which the sitter had no normal knowledge at the time.
The medium concerned in the case is Mr. C. Glover Botham ;
the name and address of the sitter are known to the Society,
but a pseudonym has by request been substituted here.
A first report of the incident was sent by 5Iiss Castleton
(pseudonym) to Sir Oliver Lodge ; this report is printed below,
the sitter's comments on statements made at the sitting being
given in square brackets :
On January 13th [1925], I had a sitting with Mr. C. G-lover
Botham of 65 Blenheim Crescent, Ladbroke Grove, W. Mr.
Botham is, I am sure, a gifted young medium who should do great
work in this study in course of time, with the necessary help
of sympathetic understanding. It is in trance mediumship that
he is at his best, his control being an Indian girl who calls herself
" Lily " and who speaks through him in imperfect English but
with a sweet and childlike individuality. Nothing whatever
concerning me or my family or friends is known to Mr. Botham.
I tell him no names which he has given me at my occasional
sittings with him nor in this particular one did he employ psy-
chometry—which in my own case he does not seem to find
necessary.
This sitting was arranged for a friend of mine who had lost
someone very dear to her, but she was unable to keep the
ajjpointment, so rather than waste the medium's time, I took her
place. It wiU be seen therefore that I was not seeking for
communications for myself in the first instance, which I consider
July, 1825 Cases 105
is a point worthy of notice. As soon as Mr. Botham was under
control, a matter of two or three minutes at most, he, in the
voice of the control told me that my mother was with me
looking very radiant and happy—" she must have known that you
would like her to come." After some very personal conversation
about a visit I had recently paid to my old home, the medium
said speaking softly
—" William "—" Will "
—[Will is my second
brother who died suddenly five years ago]. I said, " Tell me all
about Will."
" Mr. Will is so glad to be able to speak to you. The mother
draws a line round you three to show you belong to each other.
He has been to you very often, but this is the iirst time he has
been able to speak." [quite correct]. Then—after a pause
—
" Charlie "
— [Charlie is my third brother who also died suddenly
2>\ years ago].
The medium told me of the affection between these two and
described their passing, telling me at the same time of their well-
being and happiness now. It was of " Will " chiefly and it
seemed that Will was spokesman throughout. He gave me very
kind and most natural messages from him about my present
conditions—how much they thought of me because I had made
my way without help, etc. About his delight at the prospects of
another member of my family, " a boy " about to enter into som.e
new undertaking, " a linking up," or " partnership of some kind
"
[This is the marriage of a nephew]. Then—" There is a '
George
'
with Mr. Will and an '
Edith '
" [George and Edith were his brother
and sister-in-law]. Then he said, "Do they know an Annie?"
" Yes, " [Annie on this side is Will's widow, living now in
Sufiolk]. " This Annie has something amiss with her knees ?
"
I said " No." [She does not get rheumatism or anything of that
kind]. "Yes, yes," the; medium said emphatically, and rubbed
his own knees as if in great pain. I said "Not that I kno\Y of,"
but he seemed convinced and then passed on to tell me of an
" Edward " whom Will and Charlie were helping to get through to
me. I said "No, I don't know that name at all." "Yes, yes,"
the medium said, apparently working hard to get at something
—
"Edward—Edward [Wragge] " (pseudonym). "Oh!" I exclaimed,
Teally astounded, " Edwrn Percy [Wragge]." "Yes, yes (very
excited). Oh, he is so grateful to you for giving him this oppor-
tunity of speaking to you." [E. P. W. was a devoted friend of
106 Jmirnal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1925
mine who passed over twenty years ago—I little thouglit I should
ever hear of him. He was well known to my brothers]. " He
never knew that spiritual things had any meaning apart from
churches and parsons and he never went to Church." [Quite
true]. A pause, then back to " Mr. AVill " again and his sur-
roundings.
" They are shoAving me a concert room—someone on a platform
—a lady—tall—she has a basket of eggs !
" [This I'm afraid I
thought too absurd ! Who would be on a platform with a basket
of eggs ? I think I rather blushed for the medium's inaccuracy,
and though I put it in the notes I was taking, I dismissed it
from my mind as not a thing which would be likely to be
important or true or which I should be able to place.]
Then he spoke of a " boy " who goes to school close by.
The name of " Gibson," which I took to be the name of this
boy, and other things from Will but not bearing on this present
story.
On Monday, Jany. 26th, I received a letter (a most unusual
occurrence) from " Charlie's widow " in Essex, telling me that
" last week " she had had a letter from Annie (in SufEoUv) saying
that she had had a bad fall and hurt her leg. I wrote at once
to Annie sympathising and asking her to tell me particulars of
her accident. She replied by return of post as follows :
" Yes, I did have a horrid accident, on 2nd of January,
and I will tell you how it happened. I dressed up as Santa
Glaus at a big afiair given to the children of Debenham in
the Foresters Hall. I gave each child (200 of them) two
gifts which were handed to me off the tree, then to every child
who passed me again on the platform I gave from myself
a chocolate mouse done up in white crinkled paper to look like
a snowball. I went off the platform, disrobed, and then went
on again to fetch my baslx't that I had had the snowballs in. I
did not notice that the platform had not been put back close
to the wall so my left foot went down, my right leg doubled
up under me and I fainted. It was nearly a fortnight before
I was free from pain, but I am all right now except for my
knees which crackle if I go upstairs."
Since I received the foregoing I have written to ask about
the " boy " and the name of " Gibson."
JULY, 1925 Cases 107
" Annie " wrote again and said slie is very much troubled about
a great friend—the young district nurse—who is lying in Ipswich
Hospital shattered by a terrible motor-cycle accident. Her name
(though always called " nurse ") is " Gibson." At the end of her
letter she says " Roy " is now six and goes to school." [Roy is a
more or less adopted son who lives with his mother in Annie's
house.]
I have the letters and notes made at the '
sitting '
in my
possession. No one connected with me knew of these happenings
on January 2nd. In the kind of " pictorial descriptions " which
the spirit people seem enabled to give in place of verbal de-
scriptions which are more difficult, I think the fleeting vision of a
" basket of eggs " is accounted for. My sister-in-law is tall.
I can only think that my brother was doing his utmost to tell
me of these things which he had seen but which I did not know,
as his wife and I rarely communicate with each other.
M. [Castleton.]
The above report was forwarded by Sir Oliver Lodge to
the Society, and on receiving it the Secretary, Miss New'ton,
wrote to Miss C'as^feiow^ asking whether any corroborative
evidence was obtainable. On May 5, 1925, Miss Castleton
and her maid, Alice Cook, called at the Society's rooms
and saw the Secretary. Concerning this interview Miss Newton
notes that the various details given at the sitting concerning
the " lady on a platform " had been told by Mss Castleton
to Alice Cook, who has been in Miss Castleton's service for
fifteen years, on the evening after the sitting. A letter to
this effect was subsec[uently received from Alice Cook, as
follows :
Dear Madam, —All the facts of the sitting of Miss Casthtc7i
on Jan. the 13th were told to me directly after it had taken
place. I remember quite clearly that .her brother came through
and said his name was Will and he said Edith and George was
with him and did they know an Annie. The control (medium)
asked if she, Annie, had anything the matter with her knees,
and Madame said Xo, and the control rubbed his knees and seemed
sure and said, very firmly, that she had. Then the control said
she saw a tall lady on a concert platform, holding a basket of
eggs. One of the next things she said was a Boy and the name
108 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jolt, 1925
of Gibson. Madame first heard from Mrs. C. C. saying that she
had heard that Annie had had a fall and hurt her leg. Madame
came and told me of it directly she got the letter. She wrote
that night asking her to tell her about the accident and she
"wrote directly telling Madame all about it, saying she was better
but her knees were still bad. The accident happened in Suffolk,
on Jan. the 2nd, and was unknown to us or anybody who knew
us. Then Madame wrote asking about the name of Gibson and
she wrote back saying that a friend of hers by the name of
Gibson had had a bad motor cycle accident which worried her
very nmch. The boy's name who went to school was Roy, and
lives with Annie. Madame told me each thing in the letters
when they came. I hope I have told you all you want to know,
if not, will you write and ask me anything else that you wish
and I will write again.
Alice S. Cook.
The letters from " Charlie's widow " and from " Annie,"
giving an account of her accident (see above) and of the
accident to Nurse Gibson are in the Society's possession.
THE RIGHT HON. W. S. GLADSTONE'S OPINION
OF THE VALUE OF PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.
I HAVE often been asked where the Rt. Hon. W. E. Gladstone's
opinion of the importance of Psychical Research is to be foimd ;
it may therefore be of interest to quote the following extract
from the brief obituary notice of Mr. Gladstone, written by Mr.
Frederic Myers, and published in the S.P.R. Journal for June,
1898 :
Mr. Gladstone's relation to Psychical Research affords one more
illustration of the width and force of his intellectual sympathies.
Many men, even of high ability, if convinced, as Mr. Gladstone
was, of the truth and sufficiency of the Christian revelation,
permit themselves to ignore these experimental approaches to
spiritual knowledge, as at best superfluous. They do not realise
how profoundly the evidence, the knowledge, which we seek, and
which in some measure we find, must ultimately influence men's
views as to both the credibility and the adequacy of all forms of faith.
July, 1925 W. E. Gladstone's Opinion of Psychical Research 109
]\Ir. Gladstone's broad intellectual purview—aided perhaps in this
instance by something of the practical foresight of the statesman
—
placed him in a quite different attitude towards our quest. " It
is the most important work which is being done in the world,"
he said in a conversation in 1885. " By far the most important,"
he repeated, with a grave emphasis which suggested previous trains
of thought, to which he did not care to give expression. He went
on to apologise, in his courteous fashion, for his inability to render
active help ; and ended by saying, " If you will accept sympathy
without service, I shall be glad to join your ranks." He became
an honorary member, and followed with attention—I know not
with how much of study—the successive issues of our Proceedings.
Towards the close of his life he desired that the Proceedings should
be sent to St. Deiniol's Library, which he had founded at Ha-
warden—thus giving final testimony to his sense of the salutary
nature of our work. From a man so immersed in other thought
and labour that work could assuredly claim no more ; from men
profoundly and primarily interested in the spiritual world it ought,
I think, to claim no less.
Here it may be mentioned that other honorary members of
the Society, who were also greatly interested in the subject,
were John Ruskin, G. F. Watts, A. R. Wallace, and also the
distinguished Presidents of our Society, the Earl of Balfour, O.M.,
the late Lord Rayleigh, O.M., Sir William Crookes, O.M., and
Prof. Wm. James of Harvard.

CORRESPONDENCE.
Concerning the Formation of a Group.
To the Editor of The Journal oe the S.P.R.
Artillery Mansions,
Victoria Street,
London, S.W. 1.
Madam,—With reference to the announcement about starting a
group which appeared in the Journal for April 1925, I shall be
obliged if you will kindly allow me to report progress for the
information of any members of the Society who are interested in
the subject.
110 Journal of Society for Fsychical Research July, 1925
A meeting was held in the S.P.R. Library on May 26th, 1925.
The chair was taken by the late Sir W. F. Barrett, at whose
instance the formation of the group had been proposed. This
was his last visit to the Society's rooms, for he passed away
suddenly the same afternoon a few hours after leaving the
Library. We deeply regret his departure, and trust that we may
be able to carry out the project on lines which he would have
approved.
At the meeting it was resolved that an effort should be made
to establish a group " for the collection and collation of existing
materials bearing on the history of psychical subjects," or, in
other words, for literary research mainly on historical and anthro-
pological lines. The scope and method of the enquiry are to be
determined by the group itself when constituted.
It was also decided to endeavour to enlist more workers and
to adjourn the discussion to a meeting to be held in the autumn.
I shall be pleased to intimate the date of the next meeting, when
it has been fixed, to any member of the Society Avho wishes to
take part in the researches and addresses me on the subject.

Interest in what the German speaking peoples call Parapsycho-
logical phenomena appears to be growing. Controversy is rampant
throughout Germany and Austria, not so much concerning the
interpretation of these phenomena, but as to the question of
their reality. Dr. Gruber in his Parafsycliologische Erkenntnisse
affirms his acceptance of the authenticity of supernormal pheno-
mena, and in a thoughtful sketch em])hasises the importance of
the subject to the scientific man. He admits the constant
exposures of mediums, but defends some of these mediums, although
July, 1925 Reviews 111
not with the same vigour as Dr. Schroder, whose pamphlet, Pseudo-
Entlarvungen attempts to show that certain of the recent exposures
are worthless. More judicial in tone is the little book by Mr.
E. Lambert,, which is quite an admirable summing up of the
evidence, and his criticism of the Goligher ])henomena is to be
recommended to those of his Continental readers who so often
in their works appear to consider that the evidence obtained by
Dr. Crawford was of great value. On the other hand we cannot
assent to the importance he attaches to Prof. Heuniug's Russian
" medium " in connexion with the telekinetic phenomena of
Mile. T.
In his Versuclie iiber Materialisation unci Telekinese, Mr. Grune-
wald describes in some detail the experiments he has undertaken
with Mr. Johannsen and other mediums. In the first part, Mr.
Grunewald deals with the materialisation of mediumistic energy
under the influence of the conscious will, and in the second he
gives some account of alleged telekinetic movements of a balance
enclosed in a glass case. These experiments appear to have
been carefully conducted and recorded, and independent verifi-
cation of the results would seem eminently desirable.

II. The Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism : A Historical Survey.
By Leslie Curnow, B.A. Reprinted from The Ttvo Worlds.
Pp. 110, vi. Manchester, 1925.
The articles comprising this volume are reprinted from those
which appeared in The Two Worlds from October 10th, 1924, to
December 26th of the same year. They trace the history of the
various classes of alleged physical p)henomena as they have occurred
since the rise of modern spiritualism in 1848. Mr. Curnow begins
by the history of the rapping phenomena and shows how such
occurrences took place long before the rappings at Hydesville,
although he does not attempt to explain how it is that these
particular phenomena became the starting point of the spiritualistic
movement. Passing on to the other manifestations, the author
shows how lights, the movement of objects without contact, levi-
tation of the human body, olfactory and auditory phenomena and
materialisation were all recorded as occurring with the English
mediums of the past. How far these marvels are worthy of
credence it is difficult to say. Mr. Curnow appears impatient at
112 Journal of Society for Psychiad Research July, 1925
criticism, but he omits the many exposures of certain mediums
whom he extols, even when these doubts were raised hj persons
who were deeply involved in the spiritualistic activity of the time.
Thus he says nothing of the reputations of Colchester, Foster,
Duguid, Heme and Williams, and it would seem that some account
of the inner history of these persons ought to find a place in an
historical survey. Apart from these omissions, however, the book
is an interesting little addition to the subject, and for those who
have but slight knowledge of the past the phenomena of such
little known mediumLS as Mrs. Thayer, Mrs. Suydam, and William
Turketiue, ought to prove instructive and entertaining.

NOTES ON PERIODICALS.
Psychische Studien for February has a critical account by Dr. von
Schrenck-Notzing of recent experiments by Dr. Fischer with the
psychographologist Eafael Schermann, and Prof. Dessoir publishes
a vigorous reply to the attacks made upon him by Dr. Schroder
regarding the authenticity of so-called occult phenomena. The
issue for March had a criticism by Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing of
Prof. Oesterreich's philosophical views of mediumistic phenomena,
and H. Hanig has a note upon the alleged fluidic body with special
reference to the Durville and Kilner experiments.
The issue for April has an article by Wilhelm von Trajtler-Tordai
on Mediumistic Drawings, which are of some interest, whilst
Professor Ludwig has a note upon some phenomena on Hauntings.
In the issue for May, Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing has something
to say about methods of automatic registration in Psychical
Research, in which he makes mention of the results of Professor
Winther with the Danish medium, Anna Rasmussen. General
Peter has an article on Viscount Adare's experiments with D. D.
Home as published recently in the Proceedings, and Professor
Zimmer has a note on telepathic investigations with thinking,
animals. E. J. Dingwall.

were presented and taken as read.
OBITUAEY
I. Dr. C. Lloyd Tuckey.
We have to record with regret the death of Dr. C. Lloyd
Tuckey, which occurred on August 12th of this year. Dr.
Tuckey was a Member of the Society from 1889 to 1922, when
he was elected an Hon. Associate. He was a Member of
several Committees, including in early days the Hypnotic
Committee, of which he was the Chairman, and the Library
Committee, from which he retired in 1917.
He was co-opted a Member of Council in 1897, and became
an elected Member in 1901, retiring in 1922, when his state of
health made it impossible for him to attend the meetings.
He contributed a number of reviews of books on hypnotism,
and several cases, to the Proceedings and Journal, but his
principal contribution to the Society was the interest he always
showed in its work.
He was one of the pioneers in this country of therapeutic
treatment by suggestion, and his well-known book on Hypnotism
and Suggestion has been through many editions. We print
below a contribution received from an old friend and a medical
colleague of Dr. Tuckey's, Dr. A. Percy Allan :
When 1 was a student at Guy's Hospital in the late eighties
116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Oct., 1925
hypnotism, lately introduced into England as a method of treat-
ment, was causing attention and curiosity in medical circles.
Bernheim, Charcot and his school at Paris had made the initiative,
and the quiet, unassuming little doctor, Liebault of Nancy, was
working extraordinary and sensational cures. Lloyd Tuckey, then
in general practice at the West End of London, had been over to
Nancy to study the methods and means of treatment at this
famous clinic. Dr. Milne Bramwell, who followed him closely in
this work, gave a demonstration and lecture to medical students
at Bethlehem Royal Hospital. A party of students from Guy's
Hospital had attended, and, being eager for further study, were
fortunate in getting an introduction to Dr. Lloyd Tuckey, then in
practice at Green Street, Park Lane. He invited us to his house
—a party of four. Among our number was Prof. Sir Gowland
Hopkins, then a student with us. Dr. Lloyd Tuckey received us
most kindly, and having introduced us to three of his patients;
demonstrated to us his methods of work. We were all charmed
with his personality and not a little flattered by the courtesy
and consideration he showed us. From that introduction sprang
up a long and intimate friendship between him and me, which
only terminated at his death. Under his guidance and instruction
I took up treatment by suggestion, and he was also instrumental
in introducing me to the Society for Psychical Research. Like
myself and many of the older members of the Society, he was
not a " spiritualist," hut rather an inquirer into the phenomena
that our Society investigates.
Despite his fine appearance he never enjoyed robust health ; it
was trying, he used to tell me, to spend one's life largely in the
company of the neurotic and mentally perverted, which from my
subsequent life I can entirely endorse. He used to envy me in
engaging in general practice as well, as a set-off to the other
work.
Before the War his health began to fail, and he was the victim
to a physical disorder which finally compelled his retirement from
active practice. He married rather late in life, and led a leisured
and secluded life at Eastbourne. I visited him from time to time,
and assisted him in the revision of the sixth edition of his book,
Hypnotism and Suggestion. During his retirement he maintained
an interest in psychotherapy and psychical research, but was diffi-
dent of expressing an 02)inion on the newer methods of the
Oct., 1925 Obituary 117
former, as he had had no practical experience. He met his
death with extraordinary patience and equanimity, and was de-
votedly attended by his wife until the end.
A. Percy Allan.
II. Mr. Fritz Grunewald.
Through the death of Mr. Fritz Grunewald in Berlin in
July 1925, Psychical Research has lost one of its most energetic
workers in the field of the physical phenomena. Mr. Grunewald,
whose early training in engineering specially fitted him for
the task, was one of the pioneers in the work of devising
suitable devices for mechanically registering the forces respons-
ible for the physical phenomena of the seance room. Although
not a member of the Society, Mr. Grunewald was in friendly
touch with several of the officers and corresponded a good deal
concerning Continental afiairs. Mr. Grunewald possessed a well
equipped private laboratory and a review of his book describing
his apparatus was published in the Journal for May, 1923,
pp. 286-290.
CASES.
L. 1268. I. Information given through Automatic Writing
Concerning Facts op which the Automatist had no
Normal Knowledge.
Mr. Charles Thornton who had previously had some corres-
pondence and conversation with Miss Newton about some
automatic script of his own which may have been veridical
though we have not the necessary evidence to prove it, wrote
to her as follows, from the St. James' Club, Piccadilly, on
January 14, 1924.
. . . About the end of September last I was invited by two
sisters to try and get into touch with their mother by automatic
writing.
The old lady with whom I had been well acquainted in the
course of the last half dozen years, had died about 1 month
previous to the sitting [after long illness].
The short script that resulted contained two points of interest.
It terminated with :
" Will you please try and get into touch
with me another time as I have now To go to mother."
118 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Oct., 1925
The daughters informed me that the expression underlined
[above] was constantly used by her during her last illness. . . .
I am as confident as it is possible to be that I had never heard
her use those words. However, that might conceivably be set
down as an instance of " unconscious memory " or telepathy.
The second point is not susceptible of either of these explanations.
As usual in these cases I asked for evidence of identity, though
in all the circumstances I had very little hope of getting it
definitely. I cannot quote the script accurately from memory
. . . but the reply alluded to an old gold pencil ... in " my
bed-room." . . . Neither of the sisters had any recollection of
seeing their mother with such a pencil. However, when I was
at the house last night I was interested to hear that quite recently
. . . had been found [in a concealed drawer of a dressing case]
that had been in their mother's room ... a broken gold pencil
that had evidently been put away there at some time or other
as useless.
Mr. Thornton had lost or destroyed the original script
but had left a copy of it with Miss Sidgwick, from which
the following is again copied.
" Give my love to my daughters. All is well." (Question.
Did you suffer pain ?)
" No. I want to go down to old
associations and old friends." (Question. Can you give me a
proof of identity ?)
" Upstairs is a gold pen which I had made
into a pencil case when I was in G[illegible] Square. Gold pencil-
case in my bedroom. All is well and I am very happy and all
the people I have any fondness for are here and are round me.
Will you please to come and try to get into touch with me
another time for I go away to-night to mother. Good night."
In a further letter, dated January 21, 1924, Mr. Thornton
quoted the passage about the gold pencil case, which he
had by this time verified and added :
G[illegible) Square turned out to be Gloucester Square. At
the time of getting the [script] I had no idea that the family
had ever lived at any other address than CoUingham Road.
My attempt at Gloucester was an undecipherable blur and the
word Square puzzled me to account for it. They left that address
in 1897.
Last night with a view to clearing up this point I broke my^
Oct., 1925 Cases 119
usual rule ^ and sat again. In response to a question about
the pencil case I got tlie following from my father—my '
control.'
Yes, a gold pencil case was made for her by a goldsmith of
the name of AUwood [or Attwood], AUwood in a quarter of
London which is now pulled down but was in the neighbourhood
of G. (again nearly undecipherable though I now knew the refer-
ence) Square.
This account is of course too vague to be verifiable, especi-
ally as the two daughters have no recollection of hearing
of a goldsmith called AUwood or Attwood. Mr. Thornton
referred us for corroboration of the case to the ladies con-
cerned. They are two Misses Sidgwick, cousins of Professor
Henry Sidgwick, on learning which Mrs. Henry Sidgwick
wrote to them, and later called and talked the circumstances
over with them. Miss Maude Sidgwick wrote from 25 Colling-
ham Koad, S.W. 5, on January 26th, 1924 :
... I should like to give you all the help I can concerning
it. We have known Mr. Thornton about three years, and are
very intimate with him. We did not ask him to try and com-
municate with mother, but I said to him that I wished it was
possible and then he offered to try. During the last year, or
rather longer, of mother's life, this phrase " I must go to my
mother," was constantly uttered by her (she believed her mother
to be alive), but I do not think Mr. Thornton ever heard her
[use] it. Usually she only said it before [my sister] and me,
but not always, as she has often said it to her old friend Mrs.
C , and now and then to casual callers. Mr. Thornton says
he has no recollection of having heard it, but I suppose it is
just possible that subconsciously he has heard it ? On the other
hand, when he was reading over what he had written, he read
the phrase thus, " I must go to another," and I suggested that
it might be meant for " Mother," and he then said that the
first letter of the word was badly formed and was much more
like an M than an AN ;
showing that he had not got the phrase
the least bit in his mind when he wrote it.
This was, I should say, about three weeks after my mother's
death, which was on September 15 [1923].
^ Owing to continued psychic warnings Mr. Thornton had given up sitting
for automatic writing on the grounds of his health.
120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Oct., 1925
A bit of evidence which I thought very important was his
saying that " the pencil case was upstairs at G Square."
Mr. Thornton could not read this word, and thought it might
be Gordon, but I at once suggested Gloucester, as we lived there
for so many years. Now Mr. Thornton had no idea of this.
The incident of the gold pencil case was in reply to the question
we put, " Can you give us a proof of identity ?
"
[My sister] and I searched in my mother's dressing case and
found a small gold pencil, of the screwing up kind. We had no
idea it was there.
I might add that Mr. Thornton is quite convinced that the
writing is a genuine communication. I myself think the " G
Square " the most unexplainable bit.
It is of some interest to note that the supposed com-
municator in this case, Mrs. Edward Sidgwick, was for many
years an Associate of the S.P.K., and used often to attend
our meetings. Her name appears in the first published List
of Members and Associates.
L. 1269. 11. A Telepathic Dream.
We have received from Mss Ida Wild, an Associate of the
Society, the following account of an apparently telepathic
dream. Miss Wild wrote to the Editor, Mrs. Salter, as
follows :
Old Labkshayes,
Dalwood, Kilmington, Devon.
21th Novemler, 1924.
The enclosed papers cannot be dignified by the name of " case,"
but I send them as a sample of the dreams which are more and
more frequently " happening " to my sister and me.
I must say first we are much attached and intimately ac-
quainted with each other's lives and even thoughts, but we are
not often together. This is my sister's home, equally with mine,
but she is much away. However, her greatest interest is here
with me, the animals we keep, the villagers, etc. And we both
write fully and minutely of the most trivial " ha'penny-farthing
"
matters to each other.
We are both dreamers. She in her sleep and I in a sort of
hypnagogic flash vision have views and knowledge of happenings
Oct., 1925 Cases 121
very like what is happening to the other. I think you will
understand, b\it I am not able to express it clearly. I have
from time to time asked her to note her dreams when remembered,
but she is a very busy woman, with other people about her,
and has no opportunity. Now and again she makes a brief note,
as in the enclosed case, and before I have written. Too often my
letters cause her to say " I dreamt so-and-so some nights ago,"
which makes the matter valueless.
Some weeks ago—I am sorry I did not keep her letter—she
wrote that she had had a beastly dream ; she was here, and
foimd in a nest-box a rat's litter, and she was squashing the
young rats with a stick. I had not written then what had
actually happened to me—I had seen an aged or sick rat slowly
strolling across the yard and had smashed it with an iron crow.
You see what I mean by " nearly the same." Rat-killing is not
a daily job. This is the only rat I've ever slain by hand. Her
dream is very apposite. . . . Ida Wild.
P.S.—Anything important never seems to crop up in our dreams.
When I had a serious accident, and when she was ill, the ordinary
physical means of communication had to be fallen back on ;
although, in my case, I made desperate efforts to " let Ann know,"
^< as I was lying helpless.
Together with this letter Miss Ida Wild enclosed the first
page of a letter from her sister, as follows :
... I could come next week if it would be of any help. Am
I dreaming that you want to go to the dentist ? I can't find it
in any of your letters but it is stuck in my mind that you said
^ you would have to see the dentist. I am having short and
vivid [dreams] now, so it may be one of them, though mostly my
dreams have the goats in them ....
Miss Ida Wild also enclosed her own statement as to what
had actually occurred, as follows :
'2,1th November, 1924.
On Monday or Tuesday [November 24, 25], I broke the stopping
in a tooth, and wrote to the dentist for an appointment. I
iave not yet (Thursday) had his reply.
I never told my sister of the incident.
She has no reason to suspect dental trouble. I have teeth like
a negro, and my last visit to a dentist was 1920 (I believe).
122 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Oct., 1925
That last visit was to Exeter, as then (my sister being here
at the time) no qualified man was handier to us here. My sister
probably knows, but has not remembered, that a qualified man
from Lyme now visits Axminster three days a fortnight, much
handier for us. She has had no dealings with the Axminster
dentist so probably thinks I should (in need) travel to Exeter.
I could not go to a dentist at Exeter without elaborate arrangements,
three miles by road each end of the train-journey, and with a
herd of stall-fed goats I can't get away—hence her suggestion to
come home. Ida Wild.
L. 1270. III. A Telepathic Impression.
We print below a case of apparent telepathy. The case came
to us originally through Sir William Barrett to whom the
letters from the percipient and her husband were addressed.
A first report of the incident was contained in a letter from
Major-General Guthrie Smith, as follows
:
21sf December, 1914 [in error for 1924].
I have been interested by the correspondence in The Times
on the subject of " telepathy " and it occurs to me that you
might care to hear of the following curious case.
About eighteen months ago my wife and I were staying for a few
days in a small village in Switzerland. One morning, while we
were taking a short walk before lunch my wife suddenly said
to me, "I wonder what became of 'A. B.,' he was such a great
friend of '
R.' (our son who was killed in 1914). Ah well, I
suppose he was killed like all the others." On returning to the
hotel and while standing in the verandah, a young man came up
to me and said : "I don't know if you remember me. Sir, I am
'
A. B.'
"
He had been staying in a small town some 4 or 5 miles
distant and had come over to play tennis with some friends in
our hotel.
This seems to me too remarkable to be classed as a mere
coincidence, especially as neither my wife nor I can recollect
having spoken of 'A. B. '
in the previous 5 years and had not
been talking of the war during our walk.
H. Guthrie Smith,
{Maj. -General).
Oct., 1925 Cases
In reply to this letter Sir William Barrett wrote asking for
a corroborative statement from Mrs. Guthrie Smith, and also
for permission to print the case in the Journal. He received
the following reply
:
December, 25th [1924].
My husband asks me to write and thank you for your letter
and to say we have no objection to your sending his letter to
the S.P.R. Journal. We were both very much struck at the time
by the curious occurrence which he described to you. We were
staying at the time at Oberhofen and were about ^ a mile from
the hotel when I spoke of '
A.B.' The time I made the remark
must have been soon after '
A. B.'s arrival at our hotel from
Thun where he was staying. '
A. B.' is Mr. J G who on
demobiUzation became a magistrate in Nigeria and of whom we
had completely lost sight ; he was a very great friend of my
son's. I had not spoken or thought of him for a very long
time, and I was completely taken aback when I saw him come
up and speak to my husband. Agnes E. Guthrie Smith.
L. 1271. IV. Two Coincidental Dreams.
We print below a report of two coincidental dreams, which
has been sent to us by one of the dreamers, Mr. Theodore
Besterman, who is a Member of this Society ; the other dreamer
was his wife. Mr. Besterman writes thus :
Sth of June, 1925.
During the night of Sunday, the 7th of June, 1925, I had a
dream the details of which I do not remember, but the essence
of which is as follows : 1 found myself in a room with an elderly
woman and two men. 1 was aware that this woman suffered from
devil-seeing delusions ;
during the course of the dream she was
overcome by these delusions, and, mistaking me (as I hope) for
a devil, charged at me full tilt. She was prevented from doing
me an injury by the two men, but each moment she appeared
to be about to break loose. Her movements and features became
so horrible and the atmosphere of the place so full of menace
that 1 seemed to faint. When I recovered I wandered round the
place in a sort of icy terror ; at this point I was awakened by
rather dreadful screams from my wife : she was waking from a
nightmare which she at once described to me. Under the circum-
124 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Oct., 1925
stances I cannot remember tlie details of what she told me and
have asked her to make an independent statement. My recollec-
tion is that in her dream she was warned against associating
with a certain family ; that she ignored the warning and found
herseli in the company of that family ; one of them, a man,
seemed an unpleasant person : he had a black eye, and as he
was unable to explain this satisfactorily my wife began to fear
that he was a devil ! She began to sing The Gij)sy's Warning,
and on coming to some words about a devil pointed at him-
The man's face became contorted with fury and he sprang at the
dreamer, who awoke in the manner described.
A few notes seem called for. The effect of my wife's dream
is shown by her screams, certainly the worst that I have ever
heard (though she tells me they are the usual product of a
nightmare), and by her prostration on awakening. Of the effect
of my own dream I can only add to what I have already said
that when I awoke I found myself bathed in perspiration. To
make the fact that we both dreamed of devils in this unpleasant
manner of more than usual interest the following facts should be
noted. We neither of us remember ever having dreamed of devils
before. My wife has had a few nightmares before : two or three
times after her father's death and once after her mother's. In
these cases the father or mother appeared in the dream ; it is
vv'orth noting that The Gipsy's Warning used to be a sort of
standard joke in my wife's family. I do not recollect ever having
had a nightmare. I ought to add that neither my wife nor I
are aware of any psychical phenomenon ever having occurred in
connexion with us. During the day we had not read or discussed
anything devilish ;
my wife having read Mr. Galsworthy's Forsyte
Saga and I the Observer newspaper and the larger part of Mrs.
Leaning's essay on hypnagogic phenomena in the Proceedings.
We are both vegetarians and very light eaters ; between our
dinner at 7.30 and our going to bed at 11 we had eaten or
drunk nothing beyond half a glass of lime juice each. (It is true
that our dinner had consisted in part of a rice curry, but our
devils were not hot, only horrible. Besides we have had this
disli before without similar results.) We awoke about 1.50 a.m.
I think it useless to add the usual assertion that we are both
sane, sensible, critical persons, as such statements naturally carry
little conviction to those who do not know the narrators.
Oct., 1925 Cases 125
The obvious explanation of these dreams is, of course, telepathy;
but it should be noted that the dreams were practically simul-
taneous. I prefer to venture no theory. Finally, this case is of
no value as evidence, since in the nature of the case it depends
on our unsupported testimony. It .should however be of some
interest to the converted. All the above was written before I
saw my wife's accoimt of her dream, which follows, nor had she
seen my account.
Mrs. Besterman's Statement.
" I dreamed I was with some friends (men)—quite unknown to
me—on a visit to some people, also unknown to me and also all
men. We were talking and having some sort of experimental
games in which we used bottles and basins—all very hazy. One
of my friends whispered to me '
I don't think these men are
quite . . .
'
I either didn't hear the word or he left of? at '
quite.'
I whispered back '
Oh. they're all right.' After some time—it
seemed that I had been there overnight and was waking u]) after
sleeping—one of the men came towards me ; I looked straight at
him and saw that his left eye was very swollen and black and
blue. I asked him '
How did you get that black eye ?
'
He
stared hard at me and replied '
Never yoa mind.' I had a feeling
of great fear and suddenly felt he was a devil. One of my
friends—they were all standing behind me—said, '
Sing The
Gipsy's Warning,' and I immediately started to sing loudly '
Lady,
once there lived a maiden. Pure and sweet and like thee fair,'
and went on to a line (I do not know whether it is in the actual
song or not), '
And in heaven there dwells . . .
'
At this point of
the song the words should have been, it seemed to me, '
an
angel,' hut I pointed my finger straight at him and sang in a
very loud voice '
a devil,' and, as I said the word devil, his eyes
blazed up horribly. He seemed to grow longer and curve back-
wards and made as if to descend upon me ; in terrific fear I
started crying and wailing loudly and woke up in great agitation,
making horrible wailing cries, and feeling as if I were still
surrounded by devils.
I told my husband this dream on waking and have not
repeated it to him. I wrote this account before seeing his, which,
is correct in the parts referring to me."

CORRESPONDENCE.
I. CONCEENING THE TRANSMISSION OF NaMES IN
Trance-Mediumship.
To the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.
June 23r(Z, 1925.
Madam,—The point raised by your correspondent, B. G. Bouwens,
in this month's issue of the Journal (Vol. XXII, p. 94) deals with
the point of the transmission of names during trance-mediumship,
and the nature of the means used. The analogy drawn from the
four telephonists that he puts forward, is useful in so far as it
represents the four individuals concerned in the attempt at
communication ; the pair who operate from " another place," as
your correspondent puts it, that is, the communicator, and the
control, and the two who are concerned with our end of the
business, namely the automatist and the sitter. But one important
aspect of the proceeding has been overlooked in this figure of
speech. It is that three of those concerned in communicating
are functioning on the physical plane, because the personality of
the control is, for the time, so largely merged in the physical
organism of the medium, that it may be said to be receiving
impressions from " the other side," under many, if not all, of
the limitations that are suffered by the medium and the sitter,
who are in the flesh. This explains those cases where confusion
results, taking such form corresponding to mistakes that arise,
in conversation, held under difficulties, through the ordinary
channel of speech. Of this merging of the control with the
organism of the medium, Feda often gives interesting proof-
She appears to be both listening, and receiving impressions, as if
functioning on two planes of consciousness ; her touch with one
world, so to speak, both coloured and limited by her contact
with the other.
Take the case put on record in the volume called Survival (published
by Putnam & Co.), where the communicator was giving the name
" Broadbent " to the control. What actually passed through
appeared in Feda's words as " broad man, broad shoulders, a
broad head ;
altogether broad-looking, he says." Here is obviously
a case of impression rather than of mis-hearing by the control
;
a name is given by the communicator, probably re-iterated for
greater force ; it is received by the control, and passed on in the
Oct., 1925 Correspondence 127
form of an adjective. Or you may take it as a case of mis-
hearing ; but then you must say it was mis-heard, because of the
physical limitation imposed on the control by the very nature of
her work.
Again, I have known Feda say she cannot see the particular person
brought by the communicator " because he is not far enough into
the physical," for her to do so.
The " four telephonists," therefore, as an analogy, is inaccurate
unless we figure three of them operating by means of sound-values
and one by the transference of thought. Pamela Grey.
II. Extended Telepathy.
To the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.
Madam,—I don't know how the interesting case reported in the
Journal for July (L. 1207) may be officially classed, but to me it
looks like another instance of the extended telepathic action
discussed by Mrs. Sidgwick in Proc. Vol. XXXIII., pp. 330-1,
where agent and percipient are unknown to each other but
apparently linked by a person known to both. For the matters
communicated maniEestly suggest the mental unity of the living
sister-in-law, " Annie," rather than that of the deceased brother :
they were all things which had recently been in her thoughts.
The communication, as in the case, through Mrs. Brittain,
which I reported in the Jourml for November 1923, took a
spiritualistic form. That appears to be inevitable whenever
" mediumship " has been attributed to a percipient. Telepathy,
indeed, as Mrs. Sidgwick, I think has said, while it makes survival
more probable, makes it more difficult to prove.
Hubert Wales.
III. Subliminal Idiosyncrasies.
To the Editor oj the Journal of the S.P.R.
Madam,—In the letter from E. S. Thomas, in the May Journal,
p. 76, the recollection of a rose form is described as accompanied
by the turning of the eyes
'
' upwards and over towards the
back of [the] head." Mrs. A. L. Sinclair, replying to my enquiry
about her own clairvoyance, writes, April 18, 1925 :
" My '
seeing '
when my eyes are open and I am quite conscious may
128 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Oct., 1925
interest you, as I do not see things before me but seem to be
looking into the back of my head and see the pictures as on a
black curtain." I find it of interest to place these and similar
statements beside one which occurs in the Journal of the American
S.P.R., vol. X., p. 644, in a " Digest of Spirit Teachings " received
through Mrs. M. E. Keeler and edited by Prescott F. Hall. In
this it said that the astral body " is not organised, except the
eyes, which are situated back of the physical eyes and are not
usually open," and further on (p. 682) adds ''
may even face
backwards as compared with the physical eyes." Dr. Alrutz also
quotes in Proceedings xxxiv, p. 171, Mrs. Piper's remark about
having "two distinct pairs of eyes," and that she used the one
jmir behind the other. F. E. Leaning.
NOTES ON PERIODICALS.
Fasc I-II, 1925, of the Archivio Generate di Neurologia, Psichiatrie
Psicoanalisi, has an article by Professor Bianchini on sexual symbolism
in the mystic dream with special reference to ecstasy which
contains a bibliography of some interest.
Psyche for April has a criticism on the recent experiments in
thought transference with Prof. Gilbert Murray, in which the
writer insists on the necessity for control conditions before
accepting the phenomena as supernormal. Dr. F. G. Crookshank
has an interesting paper on the psychological interest in general
medical j^ractice, while Dr. William Brown discusses the relations
between religion and psychology.
Psychische Studien for June has an important paper by Mr. Lud-
wig Szczepanski of Cracow, dealing with the medium Guzik.
Sittings had been held with members of the Metapsychical Society
of Cracow and the results were disappointing. Flashlight photo-
graphs had been taken and it was discovered that Guzik had
freed one hand from the control and was using it to manipulate
objects. The exposure adds to the already considerable mass
of evidence against the reality of Guzik's phenomena, but even
the Cracow investigators are still convinced that he has some
genuine mediumistic power since they say that " during the
seances in Cracow we observed telekinetic phenomena which we
are unable to explain by trickery."

THE CHRISTIAN SPIRITUALIST AND THE S.P.R.
Some Corrections.
The S.P.R. does not in the ordinary way reply to criticisms
in the general press, but as copies of The Christian Sjnritualist
for the 7th October, with an article containing numerous in-
accuracies both about the Society and about particular Members,
have been circulated gratis among our Members, we feeljrcom-
pelled to print copies of correspondence which has passed
between Una, Lady Troubridge, and the Editor of that paper,
and to add some comments of our own.
Letter from Una, Lady Troubridge.
37 Holland Street,
Church Street,
Kensington, W.
12th October, 192-5.
Mr. J. W. Potter,
Sir,—Re the copies of The Christian Spiritualist which Miss
Radclyfie-Hall and I received from you this morning together with
a letter inviting us to become subscribers, I would draw your
attention to page 77, on which Mr. Hanuen Swaffer attacks the
Society for Psychical Research and in which he quotes, as evi-
dence of George Valiantine's powers as a spirit medium the fact
that I (Una, Lady Troubridge) in Mr. Swafier's presence,
" obtained a message from an old nurse who mentioned [my]
pet name, a most unusual one, a thing the medium could not
have guessed."
It is unfortunate for Mr. Swaffer's powers as an observer, and
for his claims as a critic of S.P.R. investigation that the above
incident never occurred.
(1) No old nurse of mine has ever purported to attempt com-
munication with me at any time or with any medium.
(2) I was never as a child called by any pet name either by a
nurse or anyone else, so the suggestion of any such pet name,
had it been made, would have been a bad mistake. In justice
to George Valiantine and in spite of Mr. Swaffer's mistakes, that
incident never occurred to me—nor anything like it.
As regards the further points he quotes in connection with
myself and Miss Radclyffe-Hall, not only does he make further
Nov., 1925 The Christian Spiritualist and the S.P.R. 131
error
—" Arthur Herbert " was not a friend of, and never met
Miss Radclyffe-Hall. {N.B. his claiming to have known her was
a bad mistake.) Not only did " Mrs. Lowther " vohmteer only
one name and not, as Mr. Swafier states two, but Mr. Swafier
learnt the names of these purporting communicators in what should
have been the confidence of a seance, and after the seance when
he asked Miss Radclyffe-Hall and myself whether he might publish
them we most emphatically said NO, explaining that until we
gave permission they must be kept private, as their publication
might cause great pain and annoyance to surviving relations.
I regret that Mr. Swaffer, by associating my name and Miss
Radclyffe-Hall's with an entirely incorrect account of what occurred
at the sittings we attended, has made it necessary that I should
send a clear contradiction of his erroneous impressions for publi-
cation in the official organ of the S.P.R. and if necessary else-
where. If he cannot report accurately, at least where we are
concerned, and presumably trusts to an unreliable memory, it
would be better that he should hold his peace.
I am still more sorry that he broke a pledge of discretion freely
given by him to us both, and exacted with a view to sparing
pain to the bereaved.
I must beg that you will not allow any further liberties to be
taken with our names in your columns. We are serious investi-
gators of many years standing—not emotional or credulous novices,
and we cannot have our position assailed by association with the
publication of inaccuracies or imaginary incidents.
Yours trulv,
Una V. Troubridge.
Reply from Mr. J. W. Potter.
Oct. nth, 192-5.
Una, Lady Troubridge,
37 Holland Street,
Kensington, W.
Madam,—I am in receipt of your letter of 12th inst. I regret
the letter, for the reason that it proves up to the hilt the exist-
ence of the very features Mr. Hannen Swaffer very rightlv and
fairly contends against, namely, the triviality of mind of those
who participate in some of these " test " sittings ; and secondly,
it is a very patent illustration of the very thing he deplores in
132 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1925
a Society of eminence and standing, namely, the unfortunate
practice of straining after a gnat and swallowing a camel.
The points on which you base your criticism of Mr. Swaffer are
very trivial. The utmost that can be said is that in the dark-
ness he may possibly have mistaken the objective of the spirit-
voice. To say that " the incident never occurred " is to ask me
to believe that a falsehood has been manufactured. I am not
prepared to accept that assertion, particularly in face of certain
records which have been produced to me.
However, I can quite understand how eager you must be to
desire to put a brighter face upon those sittings than Mr. Swafier
felt himself able to do. And for that same reason I can under-
stand your desire to withhold your names as attestees of such
sittings ; but I understand you were representing a Society of
some public standing, and anonymity does not comport very well
with its actions ; and I utterly fail to see how he could break a
pledge of discretion by using his discretion. No complaint was
made as to your personal seriousness, and I have little sympathy
with investigators who wish to remain anonymous, even if the
facts as recorded and published are not to their liking. However,
we have no desire to mention the names referred to in our
Journal^ and they would not have been mentioned had they not
been active participators in the sittings referred to—the results of
which were for publication, and could not have been of the
private character you suggest.
Yours faithfully,
J. W. Potter.
It will be observed that Mr. Potter entirely avoids the point
of Lady Troubridge's letter, which -was that after Mr. Swafier
had asked whether he might print the names of two pur-
porting communicators, and this request had been most
emphatically refused, Mr. Swaffer has nevertheless published
them, an unpardonable breach of confidence. There was no
attempt at the sittings to conceal Lady Troubridge's or Miss
Eadclyfte-Hairs identity, and Mr. Potter's talk about their
wishing to remain anonymous is simply an attempt to confuse
the issues.
To this we may add (1) Mr. Swaffer was not, as he states,
permitted to attend the sittings at Tavistock Square " as
Nov., 1925 The Christian Sjnritualist and the S.P.R. 133
representing the Press.'' The Society does not invite journalists,
as such, to attend its investigations. Mr. Swafier came as a
friend of Mr. Bradley, and as a guest of the Society. His
attack on the Society, quite apart from any question of in-
accuracy, is a flagrant breach of the ordinary rules of courtesy.
(2) Mr. Swaffer mentions " a big wire cage, in which, I
understood, Valiantine might have been asked to sit, later
on, if the sittings continued." Valiantine was not being
tested by the S.P.R. for physical phenomena, but solely for
mental phenomena ; no suggestion was ever made as to the
employment of any of the forms of control used in physical
investigations. The cage in question, as Dr. WooUey clearly
explained, was intended to hold, not any medium at all, but
articles which another medium, who was cj^uite used to this
procedure, was to attempt to levitate. Our seance room is
entirely devoid of any " contraptions designed to " grab
"
either mediums or journalists.
(3)
" Mediums do not like the S.P.R. or their methods."
This is a stale untruth. Bona-iide mediums acknowledge the
S.P.R. to be their best friend, as Mr. Swaffer can readily
ascertain by asldng either Mrs. Piper or Mrs. Leonard.
(4)
" If the Bradleys and I had not been present at the
S.P.R. sittings in Tavistock Square, the story would have
spread that because he had failed to reproduce there the
phenomena we got in Bradley's house, Valiantine was a fraud."
It is difficult to see how any medium could be accused of
fraud as a result of negative sittings, and still more difficult to
understand how the presence of ]\Ir. Swaffer and Mr. and Mrs.
Bradley could help to refute that charge if anyone were foolish
enough to make it.
CONCERNING THE FORMATION OF A GROUP.
Mr. Tretheivy asks us to publish in the Journal, in continuation
of his letter in the July Number, p. 109, the following circular letter
which he has addressed to certain Members and Associates of the
Society to invite them to join the group for literary research. He
requests any Member or Associate who requires further information
and has not already communicated with him, nor received a copy
134 Jonmal of Society for Psycldcal Research Nov., 1925
of this letter, to consider this copy as addressed to himself and
reply to it.
—Editor.
From Artillery Mansions,
A. W. Trethewy. Victoria Street,
London, S.W. 1.
Telephone : Franklin, 6145. October, 1925.
Dear Sir or Madam,—When reading Sir J. G. Frazer's Gifiord
Lectures on Immortality and the Worship of the Dead, I was dis-
appointed with his attitude towards psychic questions. He seems to
know little of modern psychical research, and, whenever he touches
on phenomena purporting to be spirituahstic, to speak in an apolo-
getic tone for wasting the time of his audience in discussing what
he regards as fraudulent fabrications. Any person going over the
same ground with an open mind and an adequate knowledge of
psychical research would bring into prominence points which he
has omitted or kept in the background. There seems to be ample
scope for starting a comprehensive survey of the whole field on
such lines. As some classes of phenomena which are familiar to
us in the West seem to occur frequently among other races, it is
reasonable to presume that there as here the genuine and the
fraudulent are intermingled. But even if the alleged phenomena
are of a type strange to us, the reports should not be discredited
on a priori grounds without due consideration of the evidence.
(2) The first step in any systematic enquiry must be the col-
lection of relevant material. When sufficient progress has been
made in this process, the uses to which the information can be
put will present themselves more clearly than can be seen at the
moment. We are at any rate justified in hoping that comparison
of both methods and residts between divers races East and West
may throw light on the true nature of such phenomena as trance
speaking, " materiahsation," and " the direct voice." In China
and Japan the " controls " of trance speakers seem similar to
those of Western mediums, for instance, Mrs. Piper. Plutarch,
with reference to the Oracle at Delphi, forestalled the speculations
of to-day concerning the source of a medium's " inspiration " and
the influence of the minds of the medium and the sitter on the
form of the message. It will be interesting to compare the
" spirit teachings " of Europe and America with those of other
parts of the world, especially China, Japan, and the South Seas.
Nov., 1925 Concerning the Formation of a Group 135
There is pretty good evidence of " direct voice " seances among
tlie Maoris of New Zealand ; there are extraordinary stories about
" materialisations " among the same race and among the Chinese.
(3) By the Maoris the spirits of infants are reputed to be the
most dangerous and cruel of all, because they have never under-
gone the trials of existence and have had no experience of the
pains which they inflict. This is an instance of the kind of
belief which, though it appears fantastic to us, should not be
dismissed olf-hand as due merely to a priori speculation. Search
should be made for some basis of psychical experience, which from
the Maori point of view has been interpreted as supporting this
theory. Such investigations may increase our knowledge of psy-
chical problems while throwing a different light on the phenomena
in question.
(4) The field is too vast for any single researcher to attempt to
cover. The only way to begin to deal with it is to form a group
and to get each member or set of members to choose a country,
or period, or other sub-division of the subject. A great deal of
literary research will be required even if it is restricted to psychical
practices without being extended to follc-lore and religious beliefs.
No doubt it is difficult to draw the line between these subjects
because in many instances traditions and opinions may have origi-
nated from " spirit teachings." Information about the psychical
practices observable in the present day will also be highly desirable,
and may perhaps be obtained through members of the Society
resident abroad. Attempts may also be made through the Press
and otherwise to get into touch with foreign correspondents.
(5) It will be expedient, as a preparatory part of the scheme,
to ascertain under expert guidance how much work suitable for
the purpose has already been done by Anthropological Societies,
Antiquaries and Researchers of various kinds.
(6) The late Sir William Barrett thought that the working section
of the Society should be increased, and he urged the establishment
of a group to gather together members wdth a sufiiciently wide field
to give scope to each for the study which appealed to him indi-
vidually. I am doing my best to carry out his ideas, and am
ready to take my share of the work, but shall be glad to leave
the superintendence and direction of the researches to other mem-
bers more competent than myself.
Will you join us, or at any rate attend a meeting, at the S.P.R.
136 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Nov., 1925
Library, on Wednesday, December 2nd, at 3 p.m., to discuss the
subject, and then or afterwards decide whether you will take part
in the work ? . -

CASE.
L. 1272. Book-Tests.
The following case came to us originally through Sir Oliver
Lodge, to whom one of the two automatists concerned, here
called Mxs. Williams, is known personally. The other auto-
matist, here called Mrs. Kerr, is an Associate of the Society.
The names and addresses of both these ladies are known to
us. The tests have been obtained by the two automatists
sitting together, using a oiiija board. Both have lost sons in
the war, and these two yomig men are the ostensible com-
municators.
The sittings at which the tests were obtained took place
between February and June, 1923, and a first account of them
was sent to Sir Oliver Lodge in December of that year. Sir
Oliver Lodge sent them on to the Hon. Editor, Mrs. Salter, in
the spring of 1924 with a covering letter, dated March 26th,
1924, in the course of which he says :
A Mrs. [Williams] my wife and I met in Scotland and got to
know well . . . has often received evidential messages. For instance
when she did not know where her son W- was, she was told
sui^ernormally, that he was in the East, and would return some
day from Alexandria—aU which was true. . . .
In December 1923 she told me of some book-tests received by
a friend of hers, a Mrs. [Kerr]. I asked Mrs. [Kerr] to make a
record ; and I enclose those letters also. . . .
Oliver Lodge.
Subsequently Mrs. Salter got into correspondence with Mrs.
Kerr, and put various questions to her in regard to points that
did not seem clear in the account sent to Sir Oliver Lodge,
including questions concerning the date and place at which the
sittings occurred. Answers to these enquiries were received
from Mrs. Kerr in letters dated Jvdy 18th and July 24th, 1925.
Nov., 1925 Case 137
We print below the report sent to Sir Oliver Lodge, incor-
porating in it the additional information received in July, 1925.
This additional information consists in a statement as to the
date and place of the sittings (the actual addresses are not
printed here), and an amplification of the report on Test 1,
making clear a point which seemed obscure in the original
statement. The final report, as printed, is corroborated by the
other automatist, Mrs. Williains.
Statement by Mrs. KERR.
[Mrs. Kerr alludes first to some earlier experiences, similar
to those described below, of which a report appeared in Light.
She then continues :]
Since then, another friend, Mrs. [Williams], and I have sat to-
gether at each other's houses, with gradually improving results.
On February 1st [1923] we got our first book-test. I may say
here that the tests are not simply proofs that minds not our own
are writing through us, but they have each an inner poignant
meaning for us which it is difficult to write down in words.
I quote from notes made with one hand while the other is laid
lightly beside Mrs. [Williams] on the traveller. The communicators
are chiefly our two sons.
Test No. 1.
Feb. 1st, 1923, at Mrs. Williams's house, Edinburgh. " Look in
our study." (Do you mean the smoking-room ?)
" No, study."
(Whose study?) "I 's room." (This word Mrs. [Williams] con-
siders was a good test in itself. The room referred to as " the
study " was her son I 's bedroom. This room Mrs. [Williams]
had been in before her son's return from his Tutor's ; it was then
an ordinarily furnished bedroom. She was aware that he now
retired to this room to read up for an exam., but as it happens,
she had not been in the room until she went to fetch the book
indicated below. She then found, to her great surprise, that he
had metamorphosed the room ; had arranged his school-books in
the book-case, had hung up dark curtains, and imported a table
and a reading-lamp ; so that in its present state the room might
well be called a study." The word " study " also, in Mrs
[Williams's] opinion, had a touch of humour about it, as there
had been a family joke about the word.)
138 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Nov., ]925
"A book with a letter in it." (On a table?) "No." (The
book-case ?) Yes. Second shelf, right-hand side, middle book.
Hill mounting—on the page a letter about hill-climbing. Count 7
to letter. Our test."
Note.—Mrs. {Williams] remarked that this would be a book about
motoring, as she knew her son had books on the subject. She
went to her son's room and picked out from his newly-arranged
book-case what she judged to be the middle, right-hand book on
second sheK. Together we opened it at page 7. The book was
a, manual on precis writing, and on page 7 was a letter in smaller
print than the explanatory matter. I quote a part of it :
" In sooth, the higher a man is raised in the ladder of
honour, the more ought he to be distinguished for his virtues,
and the higher he cUmb up the steep of virtue, the greater
shame to him if he fall into the depths of vice."
The words " climb " and " higher " come into another sentence
in the same letter, but it is too long to quote. This metaphorical
use of the words made the test an interesting one.
Test No. 2.
February 15th, 1923, at Mrs. Williams's house, Edinburgh.
" We want to say that you must watch your thoughts always.
Mind is soul. Cannot be spiritual when it harbours unworthy
thoughts. Look in your prayer-book, on page 7. Be careful.
We give a good test. Take very first book out in this room.
Top shelf—get prayer-book."
(Mrs. [Williams] said, " But there are no pi^'^yer-books in this
room. I am sure of it ! ") " Look and see." Very unwillingly
Mrs. [Williams] took out the first book on right-hand of book-case
—top shelf. This top row of books was a set of small books,
uniformly bound in ancient calf. They were really there for their
neat appearance. Mrs. [Williams] said she had never looked into
them. The book indicated was described on the Title-page as
The Voice of Devotion, a course of prayer for the private use of
Christians, dated 1829. On page 7 was the following :
"May my understanding be more informed in divine things;
my affection more holy and heavenly, my heart more right
with God. Till the day dawn and the shadows flee away,
may there be an open and unrestrained intercourse between
Thee and my soul."
Nov., 1925 Case 139
This seemed a very beautiful amplification of the thoughts sug-
gested before the test.
Test No. 3.
March 23rd, 1923, at Mrs. Kerr's house, Edinburgh. In the
course of this sitting I asked the communicator, a near relation
of Mrs. [Williams] if she could tell me what my son's chief work
was. I had tried to find out about this, but without success.
" He is most industrious about getting his special work on."
(What work ?)
" Must leave that for him to tell, he will tell you
soon."
At the beginning of the sitting there had come from my son,
" Take out my prayer-book, page 4—my own writing is on the
page, a separate page." Then followed messages for my friend
from her relatives. Late in the sitting I asked—(What about the
prayer-book test ?) "On the table upstairs in your room—page
14 or 4."
The only " prayer-book " on the table in my room was Miss
Dallas' Communion and Fellowship. The words, my own writing
is on a page, a separate page," applied, I found, to a book lying
on top of Miss Dallas'. It is curious that there should have been
this confusion, when the book below it was obviously meant. On
examining Miss Dallas' book we found that the page called 14 is
also page 4, eleven pages being taken up with introductory matter.
What is called Part I. begins on page 11, so page 14 or 4 de-
scribes this page correctly.
The prayer on this page seemed to us to furnish an answer to
our question as to my son's special work. I quote part of it :
" Whatsoever work Thou hast for him to do in his present
sphere give him the will and the grace to do it with increas-
ing love and power. ... If it be in accordance with Thy
divine purpose that he should still sliare in the work on earth,
may those to whom he is permitted to draw near, be open
to receive the help which he can give. . .
."
I have underlined the words which were specially applicable.
Test No. 4.
June 11th, 1923, at Mrs. Kerr's house, Edinburgh. We have
often noticed that the book-tests seemed to be answers to what
my friend and I had been discussing before we took up the board.
On 11th June we had been speaking in rather a depressed
140 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Nov., 1925-
manner of how difficult life was. I think the weather had been
hot and tiring. After a personal veridical message this came :
" Now we see a very curious thing in our dining-room—in a
press—on second shelf from top—a little piece of paper in which
is written a message." (Which book counting from right hand ?)
" Book 3, 1st page. That is all. Look !
" (What is on the
page?) "A curious sentence suitable to you both."
In the dining-room books are kept in a book-case with glass
doors, and also in an oak dresser. I looked first in the book-
case : the 3rd book on second shelf was Life of Naismith. There
was no writing in it ; and there was no piece of paper in it>
I then glanced at the dresser and saw that Blake's poems was
the third book on second sheU, but I did not take it out—I felt
sure there could be nothing special in it. So we concluded that
the test had failed somehow. Later in the afternoon Mrs. [Williams]
said she would like to examine Blake's poems for herself, and to
my intense surprise she found I had written on the fly-leaf,
probably at the time of Lord Kitchener's death, the following :
" Kitchener's Last Message."
" We have to stick it out and do our very best until the
release comes. I only wish I could do more, or rather, that
what I do was better work." (Extract from a letter to Lord
Desborough.)
Note that the word " message " was mentioned in the directions
before the position of the book was given.
Picture-postcard Test.
February 8th, 1923,^ at Mrs. Kerr's house, Edinburgh. This last
test is rather different as it concerns a postcard instead of a book.
The point of the test lies in the fact that about ten days-
previously I had been visiting CraigmiUar Castle, near Edinburgh,
with one of my children, and I said it reminded me of Tattershall
Castle in Lincolnshire, which I had visited with the son who now
gives us the "Tests." The point of the "test" to my thinking
is, that my son wished to let me know he had heard our conver-
sation and had been interested in it.
" We have another test now. Go to R——'s room and look in
our post-card book. Be careful. It is on the shelf. You must
Mrs. Ker)' explains in a letter that she has put this test last, although,
in date it is second, because the evidence is of rather a different character.
Nov., 1925 Case 141
turn to the page where there is a mighty house in the trees. It
is one you will remember you once took me too. No one lives
there. . .
." (What else is on the page 1) "A picture of animals.
You took me specially to see the wonderful courtyard." (Were we
alone ?) " Just us two."
On one of two shelves in a cupboard in the room indicated we
found a pre-war family post-card album.
After examining carefully the 74 pages with two cards on each
page, we found that one card alone fulfilled all the specified con-
ditions. It is a picture of Tattershall's Castle, Lincolnshire. I
was not aware that we had a card of it.
(1) It is a high castle and looks very high on the card.
(2) It rises out of trees.
(3) No one has lived there for many years.
(4) The communicator and I were there alone when he was a
small boy. We have never been there since.
(5) There are 8 cattle in the other card on the same page.
Only 5 other cards in the album depict animals, and on the pages
with them, the second card is a landscape either with or without
cottages.
(6) It is the only castle in the book which the communicator
.and I visited alone.
Mrs. Kerr enclosed with her report a copy of the picture
post-card found in the album. It represents Tattershall Castle
seen surrounded by trees.
The point which did not seem quite clear in Mrs. Kerr's
original statement concerning Test 1 was that Mrs. Williams
had never been into her son"s room since he altered the
arrangement of it, until she Avent in to verify the test. Mrs.
Salter accordingly wrote both to Mi's. Kerr and Mrs. Williams,
asking for a more exact statement on this point. The infor-
mation received from Mrs. Kerr is contained in the report
printed above ; Mrs. Williams's corroboration -was contained in
a letter to Mrs. Salter, as follow^s :
•
July, 192.5.
Book-Tests.
I delayed replying to your letter regarding the book-tests which
Mrs. [Kerr'\ and I got together, as I have been trying to find the
Precis book to send you
—
hwl without success. It is in my
142 Journal of Society for Psycldcal Research Nov., 192
Edinburgh house, I think, and when we return there in November
I shall have another hunt for it.
(1) The name of the book is Hoiv to Memorise, Expand and
Recast Extracts in Prose and Verse. Unfortunately I cannot re-
member the author.
(2) I had not been into my boy's room since he had altered
its appearance with the assistance of his twin brother. They
made the alterations just before his brother D returned to
school and I was left at home to work at some subjects and
to attend classes. Mrs. [Kerr] and I had our sitting at about
3.30 p.m. After it I Avent to my boy (I 's) bedroom to find
the book indicated. I was out of his room, and as I went
to the shelves to look for the books I noticed he had changed the
arrangement of the furniture and had put up some heavy dark
green rep curtains and hung some pictures, but I was not struck
with the fact that it resembled a study. I thought the com-
municator was being a little playful. I did not examine the book
until I returned to Mrs. [Kerr]. It was not until the next morn-
ing at about ten o'clock, when I went to my boy I 's room
to speak to him, that I fully recognised the significance of the
word " study." Although the sun was shining brightly he had the
blinds and curtains drawn—a small reading lamp (which he had
taken from another room) on which he had put a dark green
shade, stood on the table at which he was seated, and inkpots,
blotters and papers made the room look hke a scene of a " study
on the stage.
When Mrs. [Kerr] sent me her notes to read I remember telling
her that I thought she had not emphasised the fact that I had
no idea of this change made in I 's room, and did not take
in the significance of it until next morning.
My twin boys, I and D , were at the motor bicycle age,-
and all the literature they bought was on that subject. So when
I was told that the page indicated was on " hill climbing " I
instantly imagined that it would be a motoring magazine that I
would find on the shelf. I remember a distinct feeling of failure
as I descended the stairs with the Precis book. . . .

This case may be compared with the book-tests obtained by
Mr. J. F. C. Kimber (see S.P.R. Journal, Vol. XX., p. 198).
Kov., 1925 Notes on Periodicals 143
Some of the results obtained by Mrs. Kerr and Mrs. Williams
may be explained by cryptomnesia, though the knowledge
shown, especially in the first test, goes beyond what can be
easily accounted for in that way.
THIKD INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS FOR PSYCHICAL
RESEARCH.
We have been informed by Mr. Carl Vett, secretary to the
International Committee for Psychical Research, that the third
International Congress will probably be held, not in Italy in
1926, as had originally been suggested, but in Paris in the
autumn of 1927. Further particulars mil be announced our
members in due course.
NOTES ON PERIODICALS.
Psychische Studien for September lias an obituary notice of Mr. Fritz
Clrunewald by Dr. Kroner and the concluding articles on Professor
Gilbert Murray's experiments by Mrs. Sidgwick translated by
Dr. Carl Briick. Professor I. M. Verweyen of Bonn contributes
a brief account of some experiments with the medium Willy
Schneider, in which he says that his general impression was that
the phenomena were supernormal. Dr. Zeller of Hamburg gives
an account of the recent developments in the case of Frau van
Appeii, in which the medium was accused of fraud by reason of
the discovery of several compromising objects including portions
of putrescent and luminous fish. The issue closes with a reprint
of part of the evidence adduced in tlie recent law case which
Frau Rudloff instigated against Dr. IMoll and in which she finally
obtained a judgment in her favour.
The Belgian Conseil de Recherches Metapsychiques has now
issued the first of its Bulletins, in which the President, M. Eutot,
has collaborated with M. Schaerer in a paper on Les grandes
enigmas du cosmos, and local news is printed together with a few cases
of interest.
The Bidletin of the Institut General Psychologique (25" Annee-
Nos. 1-3) has an important and illuminating paper by M. Louis
Favre, the professor of experimental method in the Faculty of
Psychology. The article is entitled La MetajJsijcMqne et la methode-
144 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Nov., 1925
scientifique and is a plea for the serious and unprejudiced study
of alleged supernormal phenomena. The author takes his stand
by those who adhere rigidly to the scientific method and exposes
the hollow pretensions of those whose interest in psychical
research is based on curiosity or emotion. He recognises the
present position of the subject and suggests a form of notation
which can be applied to opinions expressed as to the value of
certain facts. The scheme is worth consideration, although it
appears that the percentages expressed would only be of value
if the reader could first assure himself of the capability of the
observing parties who employed the suggested notation.
The Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research for
July has a reply by Dr. Crandon to the recent paper by Prof.
M'Dougall on the " Margery " case and a brief article by the
late Dr. Hyslop on certain subjective sensations associated with
trance phenomena.
The issue for August has an account by Mr. Harry Price (who
has now joined the staff of the reorganized American Society)
of some sittings with the medium Willy Schneider in Vienna :
the record is fairly full although the control of the circle is not
fully described, neither is it stated how the left hand of Mrs.
Holub and the right hand of Professor Thirring were controlled.
The phenomena were similar to those which occurred in London,
but the distances at which objects were moved were greater than
anything that had been noted in England. Mr. Price describes
the phenomena as " convincing," and although some inquirers
might not care to commit themselves to this extent, it appears
to be difficult to suggest any theory which does not involve one
or other of the sitters as confederates, a supposition which will
have to be met and answered in all cases of alleged physical
mediumship.
The Value of Studies in Psychical Research. By H. A. Dallas.
Price 4-2-d. post free, from the Author, Innisfail, Crawley,
Sussex.
In this pamphlet Miss Dallas discusses various objections raised
to the study of psychical research, which she classifies as scientific,
religious, and individualistic, and gives reasons why these objec-
tions should not hold. A number of opinions are quoted from
scientific men and others as to the importance of psychical
research. B. J. D.

PEIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND
ASSOCIATES.
The 8itli Private Meeting for Members and Associates was
held ill the Hastings Hall at the House of the British Medical
Association, Tavistock Square, W.C., on Tuesday, Novem-
ber 10th, 1925, at 5 j^.m. ; Sir Lawrence Jones in the chair.
A paper entitled " Some Recent Evidence bearing on the-
Question of Survival " was read by Sir Oliver Lodge, who
described and commented on an interesting case of apparent
communication from a deceased husband, showing both memory
of the past and knowledge of present things concerning his
wife, who has herself since died. Sir Oliver had been cog-
nisant of the case (which he called the White case) through-
out the five years from its commencement, and in fact his
Secretarj^ Miss Nea Walker, had taken a principal part in the
investigation and experiments and in putting the case together.
It is intended to publish the evidence in detail in book
form under the title " Evidences for Survival," with an Intro-
duction by Sir Oliver and it is hoped that it will appear
in 1926.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING.
PRELIMINARY ANNOUNCEMENT.
The Annual General Meeting of Members of the Society (for
business purposes only) will be held at 31 Tavistock Square,
London, W.C. 1, on the afternoon of Friday, January 29th,
1926. Further particulars will be announced later.
HYPNAGOGIC PHENOMENA.
Since the pubhcation of Part XCIV. of our Proceedings dealing
with this subject, various accounts have been received from
members, of which a selection, partly in abstract, is given
below. To them are added the case of an attested veridical
vision by a lady, Mrs. Harry (pseudonym), personally known
to Mrs. Leaning, and who is the correspondent qiioted on
pp. 335, 350, 367, 386, etc., of the paper referred to. This
Dec, 1925 Hypnagogic Phenomena 147
is followed by some additional remarks by the writer on the
subject.
Various Hypnagogic Experiences.
I. From Miss M. Cunnington.
" From a child I have '
seen things ' just before sleeping.
First I had a sensation of rapid movement, then forms appear,
brilliantly coloured and lit up. It is as though the sun illumined
and gave brilliance to the moving forms. These are usually
beautiful, leaping and running figures in gardens full of flowers.
On those days when I have been to town, I see moving throngs ;
after cychng I see the hedgerows slipping past on either side,
while I seem to be darting like a swallow down and up without
effort."
II. Fro7n Miss Alice Woods.
" As a child I had these visions constantly, usually of human
beings. One of a httle organ boy came again and again, so that
I made up stories about him to myself. His figure occupied the
whole field of vision and came just before sleep. I cannot
remember any movement in connection with these visions and in
adult life there has been Little sense of motion. At present I
see landscapes which cover the whole field, but do not move.
They appear somewhat suddenly or form themselves from some
slight mistiness on the field of vision. They are always very
beautiful, but sometimes are in brown siena and not coloured.
What is much more usual is to see a most beautiful face of child,
woman, or man like a tiny miniature in the middle of the field.
These usually just fade away, but occasionally they change into
a grotesque or ugly face. Some years ago I used to see most
lovely colours, especially a most radiant blue, but I have only
had a very rare treat of the blueness since I was about 60 yrs.
of age."
' III. From Mrs. Ernest Thesiger.
Between the ages of 4 and 7 "'I used to see '
grotesques,'
horrid httle figures with leering faces and mdeterminate outlines."
From time to time another vision " was of a round whirling thine,
again of ill-defined shape, but with a sort of face, which appeared
at the cornice of the room at the corner furthest from my bed,
and rolled towards me : when it reached the middle point of the
ceiling, it vanished there, reappearing simultaneously in the corner
148 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Dec, 1925
again. It went very fast and always vanished at the centre.
The last time was before I was twelve." After-images, such as
worms after a day's hoeing, sweet-peas, after cutting many hours,
have occurred, though " I am a very bad visualiser."
IV. From Mr. H. F. Saltmarsh.
" I have visual hypnagogic illusions with great constancy. . . .
But in addition to the ordinary phenomena it happens sometimes
when I am getting drowsy a sentence or phrase keeps coming
into my mind. It is usually completely nonsensical ; I have
not consciously taken any part in forming it, nor have I any
control over it, it comes and goes apparently from some extra-
neous source. There is no pseudo-auditory or other sensory
accompaniment. I am, as in other hypnagogic states, sufficiently
conscious to criticise and be interested in it. . . . This is what I
call the pure phenomenon, but I have also experienced it, though
less frequently, mixed up with the visual type. In these instances
I have a hypnagogic vision of a printed book which I try to read.
I never succeed in getting more than about half a line, and it is
always the same sort of nonsense. I have never been able to
remember any of the sentences except on two occasions when I
spoke them aloud in the hearing of my wife. The first case
was accompanied by a vision of people walking up and down a
road which I recognised. I said '
there are multi-millionaires
and psychical entities walking about.' The second case is hypno-
pompic and is of the pure type. I said aloud '
What's the
squadron ? '
What I wanted to say was '
What's the time ?
'
If I am right in considering these phenomena as being of the
same nature as the more common hypnagogic visions, I think
they throw some light on the theory of origin. It is a plausible
theory that the visual type arise from entoptic phenomena, and
the auditory from similar entauric sensations, but in the case of
the sentences unaccompanied by any pseudo-sensations a peripheral
origin seems to be out of the question."
Mr. Saltmarsh further asks whether the data show any connection
between visualizing power and power of control. As the per-
centages shown do not apply to the same individuals in the two
groups respectively, nothing can be based on a comparison of
them. The contradictory results given by those cases where
there is sufficient information, points, however, to there being no
necessary connection involved.—F. E. L.
Dec, 1925 Hypnagogic Phenomena 149
V. From Mr. E. S. TJiotnas.
" With regard to the mental moving pictures, I am led to
wonder whether the never-ceasing cinematograph is not possibly
due to a slight derangement of the optical nerve-roots or brain
areas relative thereto. One can see no use for the everworking
cinematograph or regression of visual images. For the never-
ceasing stream of thought or memory there is a utilitarian object,
—the adjustment of past experiences to present needs.
I have been struck in my own hypnagogic experiences by visual
imagery of landscapes in which moving objects occur. ... I had
many before the war. At times just before sleep I could conjure up
the visual perception of anything I liked ;
e.g. faces of friends with
most amusing distinctness and naturalness of detail. At other times
[ I have, and had never been, a good visualiser. Hypnagogic
faces I often see of the kind described by Myers, grotesque and
hideous faces growing larger, moulded out of the dark purply
background of the '
screen.' [They] are indescribably horrible at
times, leering and evil, with raw gaping mouths. Yet they are
not terrifying ;
they only fill me with amazement and they do
not affect my dreams." (Letter of May 1923.)
" I am a generally healthy person, seldom seriously ill, but tend
to be easily depressed. I am short-sighted but have had no
optical hallucinations which could be attributed to eyesight. I
feel myself that the hypnagogic phenomena have no connection
with eyesight, or experience, or generally with one's artistic or
aesthetic proclivities in the form they take. [The faces] at first
are only faintly visible : then they come forward and become
better '
lit,' crowding round or passing away to my right. They
are either long or puffy as a rule, the latter as though made of
cotton wool or dough. I think the two forms keep distinct, the
long type elongating and dropping to pieces like a viscid material,
the other breaking away more or less laterally ... I have no
control over them except to dismiss them at will, if I think of
it, which is equivalent to returning to full consciousness. I
should class separately exceedingly distinct and minutely accurate
visions of friends and relatives which I am able very occasionally
to summon at will. There is not the same '
psychic tone
'
accompanying them as the others. There is in the latter case a
tone feeling difficult to describe : utter solid silence : a kind of
relaxed numbness.
150 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Dec, 1925
I too have experienced the bright sunlight landscapes, but less
frequently : usually a white road in an avenue of trees, every
detail—-leaves, trunk, cart-ruts, pebbles—microscopically clear. I
have seen a little figure running down the road, bobbing as he
€omes : I observed him with reference to the trees, and he really
'
moved.'
A year ago after a successful effort to compose a mediaevaUy
conceived illamination to an old carol, I had a remarkable hyp-
nagogic vision of a hyper-mediaeval, hypergothic type : positively
celestial, blue white and gold, angels and kings in sumptuously
embroidered garments, with collars like Richard II. in the West-
minster altar embroidery, gothic tracery galore, musical instruments,
gracious smiling faces : I remember the general setting well. Then
came a glorious statue of a queen, with long plaits, in a curious
high crown with a wonderful type of face something like the
early Greek type . . . She opened her eyes and gradually glowed
with living hues . . . Latterly after seeing some pre-Raphaelite
pictures which delighted me very much, I had gorgeous colour-
experiences. Endless carpets were unrolled, changing rapidly.
They had carpet patterns, but the colours glowed like sunlit
stained glass, producing . . . rich and majestic effects. The whole
effect . . . was of splendour and graciousness, and glory, and
rarity." (Letter of June 5th, 1925.)
In reply to questions Mr. Thomas wrote (June 12th, 1925) :
I have never seen tiny figures ... At what age I started seeing
I cannot say. I feel that I saw them as a small child very dim
and misty, and that I also have seen them as a child vaguely
fearfully, with my eyes open and very large. (It comes back as
I write). I saw the Devil under a bush in the kitchen garden when
about 6 in Ceylon. (My childhood, through native servants, was
occupied with much " devil " thought !). At night I used, occa-
sionally, to hear music, generally of an intensely sad nature."
VI. From Prof. Romaine Newbold.
When about 8 years old, just falling asleep, I felt something
soft and warm press against the back of my neck for a moment
and then withdraw. I thought it was the cat, but in a moment
realised a cat could not thus withdraw without giving more
definite evidence of her presence : then I shrieked in terror and
my parents had much trouble in pacifying me ... I have had no
Dec, 1925 Hypnagogic Phenomena 151
other hallucination of touch, but can explain the above, which I
recall vividly, in no other way.
In 1881, when I was 15J yrs. of age, I spent a week or so
camping on the south shore of Long Island . . . gunning for snipe
and plover. While falling asleep I would see vivid pictures,
now of the reedy bay shore, now of the sandy ocean beach, with
or without the birds I was seeking. I have never had any visua-
lizing power, and these brilliantly colored pictures gave me my
first comprehension of what I had lost by not having it.
The first hypnagogic visions since then I can date from my
recovery from influenza in 1889. For days I was tormented at
night with horrible faces and the like. But as I do not recall
iDeing alarmed, I presume the experience was not wholly novel.
If I am delayed in falling asleep I very frequently begin to
^'
see things." These belong to definite classes, and the classes are,
I think, never intermingled.
(^4) Faces, with or without figures. Of two kinds :
(a) Ugly, often, with grotesquely compounded bodies. These I
see only when in bad health, especially when suffering from indi-
gestion. I am quite certain that the devils portrayed in middle age
sculpture and painting had their origin in the bad food and con-
sequent chronic indigestion of the workers. At all events I have
frequently seen troops of precisely similar devils.
(6) Ordinary people such as one sees on the street. Always
seen singly, in semi-darkness, motionless, in gentle melancholy,
like the grieving relatives on a 4th century Greek grave stele. I
have never seen anyone I knew or any face of conspicuous beauty,
nor have I any voluntary control over what I see. Effort to
exert it usually causes them to disappear. The figures are always
clothed. I have never seen a nude or obscene figure. There is
little if any color.
(5) Visions of natural objects, (a) Most frequent of all, the
starry night sky. (6) Very frequently I find myself flying, face
downward, about 20 ft. above the ground. It is always night,
and I am following a road, trees, fences, fields, dimly seen along
the roadside (generated by automobile experiences). (c) In a
white fog I see openings and catch glimpses of distant landscapes.
None are recognised.
All the above are of common types, but the last is of a kind
'which I think is not common.
152 Journal of Society for Psychical Research dec, 1925
Two or three times I have caught glimpses of what I took
to be the convolutions of my own brain. One experience was so
curious that I will give details ... I saw a darkish field or area
like the circle cast on the screen by a lantern. In it were a
number, say 7-15, of rounded objects, irregular in shape, like
pebbles or potatoes, irregularly disposed, each glowing with a
soft light like that of a glow-worm. The most distinctive feature
of this vision was its permanence. With this sole exception, all
I have seen last but a moment ; I cannot hold them long enough
even to see the details I wish to see. But this was fixed, save
that the boundaries of the field expanded or contracted from time
to time. I contemplated it in curiosity for a long time. Suddenly
the lower boundary moved downward bringing into the field a
new object. It was something like a starfish, but the arms were
but slender threads springing from projections of the central body
and I only saw half of it something like this [diagram given] -
Both the centre and the arms glowed with brilliant light, like
that of a full moon, very much brighter than that of the objects
I first saw. I recognised it instantly as one of the " giant star-
shaped cells " of the nervous system, and inferred that the objects-
first seen were brain cells. A thrill of excitement went through
me—and instantly all disappeared. I saw darkness only. Long
I watched for its reappearance, and once did I see the tips of
the "tentacle" on the left (there were, I think, three "tentacles"
visible in the upper side), but I saw no more ... I should have
added to my list the twitching '
head-snaps,' flashes of light,
sound of explosion before falling asleep, all of which I have
experienced frequently."
Remarks by F. E. Leaning.
Among the suggestions made to account for hypnagogic visions
are two purely physical ones : that of Mr. Thomas, that they are
due to disturbance of the optic nerve, and that of Prof. Newbold's,
that indigestion may have much to do with it ; in both cases
this applies especially to the " grotesques." Since Dr. Head's
enquiry established a connection between a certain kind of hallu-
cination and visceral disease, this is quite a plausible idea.
Writers on psycho-analysis, however, who identify dream pheno-
mena with the hypnagogic, and have given very little attention.
Dec, 1925 Hypnagogic Phenomena 153
to the latter, have an explanation of theriomorphic or animal-
shaped forms as symbols of a special (moral) conflict.
More light on the subject as a whole seems to me to be found
in Dr. Morton Prince's studies of co-conscious activities than in
any other direction. These studies are experimental, extended
over many years, and found to be of practical application by other
persons. They seem to establish the fact that there may be, as
Herschel said, a thought, an intelligence, working within our
own organisation distinct from that of our own personality,"
—
our conscious personality, that is, and working with the general
material supplied by it, but recombined and elaborated. This is
not speculation or hypothesis, but an interpretation very strictly
based on facts, which may be examined in the following papers
by Dr. M. Prince, which I give for the use of those wishing to
follow it up, in addition to the less detailed examples in his book

Veridical Hypnagogic Vision by Mrs. Harry, reported
BY F. E. Leaning.
On the 2nd July, 1925, Mrs. Harry (pseudonym) wrote to
me as follows :
Since sending my experiences to you I have had within the last
month quite an interesting one : an early morning " vision,"
154 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Dec, 1925
between first and second sleep, in a state of passive but aware
consciousness, I saw suddenly, all at once, a clear vision of my
sister, seated quietly at a table, her face in profile, not looking
at me, and apparently unconscious of me. She moved her head,
looking downwards as if in thought. I noted her dress, dark with
a full light pattern all over it. When writing her next I related
this and asked if she had such a dress. We have not met for two
or three years. Her reply stated the description of the dress was
quite correct and was one I had not seen. I mentioned I saw it as
a very dark navy or black, with a light pattern. It was dark navy.
Aftor a visit to Mrs. Harry, she obtained for me the
original letter to her sister, Mrs. Jach (pseudonym), written
June 11th, giving the same account as the above, and Mrs.
Jack's reply, as follows :
It's quite right. You got me some hour of abstraction or
other, (sitting at the table), the frock quite correct, and I enclose
the belt for you to see (not worn now) quite an old cotton voile
I've had some few years now, but you have never seen it. As
you " saw " me at 5.30 on waking (a.m.) obviously it was the
developing of the impression that you had received earlier, the
day before probably.
It will be noted that this is a very similar case to that of
Miss Ida Wild and her sister, reported in the Journal for
October.

The Mind and its Place in Nature. By C. D. Broad. London :
Kegan Paul, 1925. (International Library of Psychology and
Scientific Method.)
This volume is an extended version of the Tarner Lectures,
recently given in Cambridge by Dr. Broad. The aim of the
Tarner Benefaction was to found a course of lectures on " the
relation or lack of relation between the various sciences " and in
the present work the author has fully complied with the condi-
tions of the Benefaction.
The book is divided into five sections. The first is devoted to
a consideration of the various alternative theories of life and mind
Dec, 1925 Reviews 155
whilst the second is concerned with mental knowledge of existents.
In the third section Dr. Broad examines with some care the
various theories of the unconscious ; and in the fourth he dis-
cusses in outline the arguments, both ethical and empirical, for
human survival of bodily death. The fifth section concerns itself
with the unity of the mind and the unity of nature, concluding
with a few remarks as to the probable future of mental evolution.
It is impossible in a few words to discuss or even to indicate
in broad outline the many remarkable features of this brilliant
and stimulating book. The author summarises the various argu-
ments for and against such theories as Biological Mechanism and
Substantial Vitalism in a lucid and penetrating manner, showing
how the theory of Emergent Vitalism may prove more accej^table
than Substantial Vitalism, inasmuch as it does not assume the
existence of hypothetical entelechies. Moreover Emergent Vitalism
does not require or necessitate (as Biological Mechanism appears
to do) a Deistic complement, although it is consistent with such
an idea should there be any valid reason for believing in such a
Being as Deism necessarily implies. In this connection Dr. Broad
has admirably summed up the arguments from " design " with
their natural relation to teleology ;
concluding that the theory of
entelechies has received some favour on account of the teleological
nature of organisms regarded from at least one point of view
which he clearly expounds. On this basis, the author argues,
entelechies have a dual nature which would seem scarcely com-
patible, since on the one hand they may be regarded as very
inferior minds or inferior parts of minds animating organisms,
and on the other as really master minds which almost deserve
the title of " gods." Although the whole volume is essential to
the general student of philosophy, it is above all important to the
psychical researcher. For in Section D. Dr. Broad has discussed
the arguments for human survival, and in doing this he has
largely drawn his facts from those so laboriously collected by the
Society for Psychical Research. Thus he commences the second
chapter of this section by presupposing that the work of the
Society " has elicited a mass of facts which may fairly be called
" supernormal," in the sense that they cannot, if genuine, be
explained on the usual assumptions of science and common sense
about the nature and powers of the human mind." Having
assumed the genuineness of a great many of these facts, Dr.
156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Dec, 1925
Broad proceeds to examine firstly the ethical arguments and
secondly the empirical arguments. Belief in survival would seem,
according to the author, to be founded upon five reasons. (1) Some
have thought that it was immediately obvious or that they had
received a divine revelation which assured them of it. (2) Others
have believed it on authority. (3) Some have thought that it
could be proved by general metaphysical arguments. (4) Some
have thought that it follows from certain ethical premises. And
(5) some have thought there is special empirical evidence in favour
of it. Now, of these five reasons the first two can be dismissed,
whereas the third and fourth Dr. Broad ignores, since he is of
opinion that those metaphysical arguments with which he is ac-
quainted are extremely doubtful either in their a priori part or in
their empirical part or in both. There remain therefore only the
ethical arguments and the empirical arguments. After a discussion
of the question whether ethical arguments with factual conclusions
can be logically valid, Dr. Broad passes to the most plausible
of those which have been produced in support of the hypothesis
of survival. For this purpose he examines the article by Professor
A. E. Taylor, entitled " The Moral Arguments for Immortality," ^
but concludes that the author of that pajjer has not produced any
valid arguments for human immortality. Such evidence. Dr.
Broad thinks, is to be sought, not in ethical considerations but
in the empirical arguments based on the phenomena treated by
psychical research. Now in discussing the antecedent probabihty
of human survival as a hypothesis which adequately describes the
facts, certain rival hypotheses have to be considered. For instance,
there is the theory of a very extended telepathy among the living ;
the theory of impersonation which is often connected with another
theory which describes the impersonators as " devils," and other
hypotheses of a similar kind. Dr. Broad admits the extreme
difficulty of discussing the intrinsic probabihty of survival and the
rival hypotheses. But he thinks that the common theory of im-
personation (in which I understand him to mean impersonation
from without) can be neglected, especially in its diabolic form,
which he explains very simply as due to a desire to frighten
people from dabbling in the occult, and also to that very general
feeling of exclusiveness such as that felt in the medical profession
^Holborn Reviev; April, 1920, XI. (N.S.), [LXII.], 213-234.
Dec, 1925 Reviews 157
and trade unions when quacks and " blacklegs " are objects of
discussion.
Apart from these considerations, the world as it appears to us
in ordinary experience furnishes no trace of support for the belief
in survival ;
although Dr. Broad admits that the absence of
evidence cannot be regarded as in any way conclusive as a
negative argument. Similarly all arguments based upon the amaz-
ing picture of the world and the apparently haji-hazard manner
in which many human beings make their appearance thereon, are
shown by Dr. Broad to be logically fallacious, since they rest
mainly upon the illegitimate introduction of judgments of value
into questions of fact.
The scientific arguments against survival centre around epiphe-
nomenalism ; even though there are other theories concerning the
relation between mind and body which would seem less unfavour-
able to the hypothesis of survival. Having examined these alter-
natives, Dr. Broad turns to the abnormal and supernormal
phenomena. He sees in the cases of supernormal phenomena
which are said to suggest survival rather what he terms persistence
than a conscious, continuous and surviving mind existentially
independent of its body. For the sake of argument he conceives
the mind as a compound of two factors ; the psychic factor and
the bodily. Now it might be supposed that the psychic factor
persists for a time after the dissolution of the bodily factor to
which it was originally united. This persisting psychic factor
may then become attached to the organisms of certain persons
(mediums), and form what Dr. Broad calls a " mindkin." The
psychic factor alone is no more a mind than the body in the
grave is a mind ; it only becomes part of a mind, or a " mind-
kin," when attached to another organism normally animated by
its own psychic factor. This theory is developed at some length,
but Dr. Broad is willing to admit that if the cross-correspondences
really showed the signs of deliberate intention which are claimed
for them, then something more than the mere persistence of a
psychic factor might have to be conceded. He is not, however,
satisfied that this claim has been substantiated, and even if it
were granted it would not be unplausible to suggest that the
active participants in the work were minds incarnate rather than
discarnate. It is true that in this case an ingenious process of
telepathic selection has to be assumed, but this selective operation
158 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Deo., 1925
has to be assumed in any case, and as requiring less assumption
than the hyiDothesis of survival would seem to possess greater
intrinsic probability.
How far Dr. Broad's hypothesis of the psychic factor will
account for the existing facts is hard at present to estimate.
The conception clearly rests upon the difficulties of any adequate
description of the facts in the terms demanded by epipheno-
menahsm or its derivatives. But in what way Dr. Broad would
describe the psychic factor when detached from its own organism
is a question which is not fully discussed in this book. It is to
be hoped that the author will return to it in another volume as
tolerantly written and as lucidly expounded as the present.

The Crisis in Psycliohcjy. By Hans Driesch. Princeton Univer-
sity Press, Princeton, N.J. ; Oxford University Press, London.
Pp. xvi, 275.
Even more markedly than the other philosophic sciences. Psy-
chology still lingers in that preliminary stage of development in
which a science has to experiment with '
first principles,' that is,
to search for assumptions which will enable it to progress. The
more and the more consciously, therefore, it experiments, the more
likely is it to hit upon conceptions which will be valuable, and
so (in a wide sense) '
true.' It is, therefore, a complete technical
justification of Psychical Research that it is one of the many ways
of experimenting with psychological principles, and by no means
the least promising and the least likely to lead to success in controlling
the operations of mind. It is also an excellent reason for wel-
coming another such experiment in the interesting little sketch
of a psychology which Professor Driesch bases on his '
theory of
order.' But a still more cogent reason for welcoming this book
may be found in the attitude towards Psychical Research which
it reveals. The day is no doubt past, when any psychology which
claimed to be '
scientific '
would, as a matter of course, ignore the
psychical phenomena, such as dreams, hypnotism, dissociation of
personality, subconsciousness, unconsciousness, co-conscio;isness and
immortality, not to mention such horrors as telepathy, clairvoyance
prophecy and spiritism, in which Psychical Research found the
problems for its studies ; but even now they only receive a
grudging mention in most academic psychologies, and I do not
Dec, 1925 Notes on Periodicals 159
know of anything to equal Prof. Driesch's generosity in devoting
about one-third of his space to their discussion. It is true that
even so, to go into these topics fully, his book is not planned
on a sufficiently ample scale ; it arose out of popular lectures
delivered at Peking, Tokyo, and Columbia, and cannot go very
deep into the topics it selects as worthy of mention. But the
change of attitude is very significant of the change that has come
over the academic world in Germany, and is very encouraging.
Prof. Driesch not only expresses his conviction, based on personal
experience, that " there are parapsychological or '
psychical '
facts
of various kinds "
(p. 230) ; but recognizes their importance, and
justifies his treatment, because as he rightly points out, in every
science the problematic side is more important for its advance-
ment than the side which is well established " (p. 242). His
general conclusion about the '
crisis ' of psychology is that " the
older psychology . . . had become absolutely alien to mental life
as it is experienced by natural men. It '
explained ' something
that did not exist ! But modern psychology tries to explain what
really is present. The popular view of mental life is deepened
by it, but not displaced "
(p. 266). Assuredly, if, as is rumoured,
Prof. Driesch will accept election as the next President of the
S.P.Pt., we shall have every reason to look forward to a Presi-
dential Address which will be a real contribution to the theory
of the puzzling phenomena which engage our attention.

NOTES ON PERIODICALS.
The Revue MetafsycMque for July-August has an interesting
account by Professor Cazzamali of Milan on his experiments on
alleged radiations proceeding from the brain. The subject first
attracted attention in 1912 when Prof. Cazzamali was employing
the sthenometer of Joise and when he came to the conclusion
that the movements of the needle were certainly not due
entierement aux radiations thermiques des corps "
(p. 215).
Proceeding to more complicated apparatus he constructed an
isolation chamber to assist in the experiments. This apartment,
which in certain aspects resembles Dr. Boyd's experimental room
in Glasgow for his work on the emanometer, is lined throughout
160 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Deo;, 1925
with sheet metal ; the floor is of pine, mounted on porcelain blocks,
ani there is an opening in the roof to permit entrance and egress.
The main principle of the experiments is to ascertain the existence
of brain " waves " from the subject by means of wireless tele-
phonic ap])aratus. Various subjects have been tried and Professor
Cazzamali maintains that the unexplained noises heard in the
receivers are due to mental action on the parti of the subjects,
or in his own words that from the human subject proceed " des
oscillations electro-magnetiques dvi type des ondes radio-electriques."
How far Professor Cazzamali's conclusions will be confirmed by
independent observers remains to be seen, but that such inquiry
is desirable seems obvious and would become even more necessary
if the unexplained noises receive further confirmation through
automatic registration. Control would then consist in verifying
independently the times of the noises as registered and the times
recorded by the investigators when applying the various stimuli
to the subjects. E. J. D.
ALTERATION IN THE METHOD OF NUMBERING
THE PROCEEDINGS AND JOURNAL.
The attention of Members is called to the fact that from
next month, January, 1926, onwards, the numbers of the
Society's Journal and the parts of Proceedings will be numbered
in Arabic in place of Roman numerals. This suggestion has
been made from time to time by various Members of the
Society and the present decision was reached by a vote of the
Council on a motion proposed by Sir W. F. Barrett.

SAVAGE TELEPATHY.
We have received from Mr. Theodore Besterman the following
correspondence concerning a case of ''savage telepathy:' The
case is an old one and no further enquiry is now possible, but
it seems worth while to put the incident on record for comparison
with other similar incidents which are from time to time recorded
—Ed.
Following a letter which I addressed to The Observer in reply
to a query concerning savage telepathy, I received the following
communication from Commander R. Jukes Hughes, R.N. (ret.) :
Whiddon House, nr. Newton Abbot,
2Qth October, 1925.
I read your letter in the Observer of the 11th inst. with much
Jan-., 1926 Savage Telexiathy 3
interest, having had an experience of Native Telepathy. In the
year 1878, I happened to be serving upon a Govt. Commission
in the Transkei (S.A.). Our Chief was Col. J. T. Eustace, E.M.,
with Kreli the Chief of the Gcalekas and the third member was
a Capt. T. Sansom. At the time I am writing of, our work was
near the right bank of the Bashee River (the S.W. boundary of
the Pondos). The Gcaika-Gcaleka War was recently over and
the Transkei was absolutely clear of natives. The Commission
employed about a dozen natives, but their work for the same
kept them from roaming the country.
One day they came to us rather excited and announced that
there had been a great disaster in Zululand, that our troops had
been overwhelmed by the Zulus, who were pouring into Natal.
We had an immediate consultation as to what we should do, as
if the rumour was correct it was possible that a general rising
of all the Kafirs west of the Tugela River would take place, in
which case we should have to " scuttle " for the Old Colony with
our horses and leave the wagons to their fate ; but within a few
hours we had further news through the same agency stating that
the strain had been relieved—this was the result of the noble
stand made by the handful of troops at Rorke's Drift.
News of the disaster did not reach us officially until two days
after the event.
We were roughly speaking some 300 miles (as the crow flies)
from the scene of the disaster Isandalwhana, with some very
rough country between, including several rivers. For some years
I lived under canvas on those parts so had a fair knowledge of
the difficulties of travel.
R. Jukes Hughes,
Commander, R.N.
(retired list).
I addressed a series "f questions to Commander Hughes,
which he very kindly answered to this effect
:
The events occurring in Zululand were reported to us within
an hour or so (if not quicker) of their occurrence.
The natives did not state from whom their information was
obtained, this I should not have expected them to do. Not
many kraals, only principal ones, would have a Witch Doctor.
In my opinion it was absolutely impossible for natives to have
4 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan., 1926
obtained the information by normal means, certainly not by
water communication.
Commander Hughes gave his kind permission for his experi-
ence t--- be recorded in the Journal. This certainly seems to
be a cryptesthetic incident of a kind of which we possess far
too few examples to justify any generalisations.
Theodore Besterman.
NOTE CONCERNING CASE No. L.1272.
With reference to the book-tests printed in the November
Journal (Vol. XXII., p. 136), one or two enquiries having been
made as to whether the records were complete, as printed, or
whether any failures had been unrecorded, we wrote concerning
this question to Mrs. Kerr, by whom the original report was
sent to us.
Concerning these two results Mrs. Kerr writes to the Hon.
Editor, Mrs. Baiter, thus :
December 6th, 1925.
... I enclose the list of the sittings Mrs. [Williams] and I had
together from the time " tests " began to appear.
You will see from this that only one was a total failure. Mrs.
[Williarns) had asked where a certain key she had lost had gone
to, and the answer was wrong. The key was not there. But
it was a confused sitting.
The other one about the pocket-book was also confused and
contradictory, owing, I believe, to our asking a lot of questions,
which always leads to wrong answers being given. I suppose our
minds are working hard and actively and suggesting answers,
instead of remaining passive, which is the condition for successful
" writing." M. L. [Kerr].
It appears from the detailed statement sent by Mrs. Kerr
that the test concerning the lost key was not a book test at
all and need not therefore be taken into account in the series.
The test concerning the pocket-books, which though confused,
was not entirely without interest or value, may be reckoned
as a book-test in so far as it was concerned with a book,
but it Avas of a rather different type from the other tests in
the series.
Jan., 1926 Minutes of a Group Meeting 5
MINUTES OF A C4R0UP MEETING.
We have received from Mr. A. W. Trethewy the following
Report of the Proceedings of a meeting of the Group he has
been organising (see Journal for November, 1925, Vol. XXII.,
p. 133):
PROCEEDINGS AT A GROUP MEETING HELD IN THE
S.P.R. LIBRARY, Dec. 2nd, 1925.
Present.
Mr. T. Besterman. Mrs. Kingsley.
Miss A. J. Case. Mrs. Leaning.
Mrs. St. John Clarkson. Mr. G. R. S. Mead.
Miss L. Corry. Mr. H. and Mrs. Pennington.
Mr. G. a. de Zoysa. Miss Perkins.
Mr. B. Jordan Smith. Mr. A. W. Trethewy.
Mr. Mead took the chair by the request of the members and called
on Mr. Trethewy to open the discussion.
Mr. Trethewy read the minutes of the last meeting, and stated
that a satisfactory assurance having been received from the
Council as to the favourable consideration of articles describing
the researches of the group for insertion in the Society's publica-
tions, he had sent to more than fifty members of the Society a
copy of his letter printed in the November Journal, inviting them
to attend the present meeting.
He then mentioned some communications from Professor Bozzano
and others, offering help or making suggestions though unable to
be present.
The scope of the work was then discussed, and after consider-
able debate it was decided that the research should embrace
psychical phenomena of the following kinds :
(1) All objective phenomena.
(2) Subjective phenomena :
(a) occurring in abnormal states of consciousness ;
(&) occurring in dreams subsequently found to be veridical.
It was also decided that members who have not yet chosen ,
a
branch of the subject may do so, informing Mr. Trethewy of their
choice, and that members willing to read for the purpose of
6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan., 1926
research, but not ready to undertake any separate branch, may
report the result of their studies to Mr. Trethewy.
Further consideration of plans was deferred to another meeting
to be held after the winter.
A. W. Trethewy.
A CASE OF HYSTERICAL AMAUROSIS.
We have received from one of our Members, Dr. Weston D. Bayley,
of Philadelphia, a report, reprinted from The Hannemannian
Monthly, August, 1925, on " An Unusual Case of Hysterical
Amaurosis." The patient, a man, thirty-six years of age, a barber
by trade, was referred to Dr. Bayley by a local oculist, " with
the comment that he could find nothing organically wrong with
the eyes, but desired to exclude the possibility of some intra-
cranial condition which might be surgical." He was a married
man with one child, and iip to the time of his loss of vision had
always enjoyed good health. Dr. Bayley writes:
In May, 1923, " he gave to a friend a quart of blood, by
transfusion," with no ill effects. His present condition dates
from November 3rd, 1923. He was then in his usual health
and had worked all the morning, going home for lunch at
noon. On leaving the house at 12.30 he slipped on the icy
porch, striking his shoulder and head ; but was apparently
uninjured, thought no more about it, and continued his work.
At 2 o'clock he placed a customer in a chair for a shave.
While handling the brush, vision suddenly became dim, and
in a few minutes was reduced to mere light perception.
During and before this there were no associated symptoms.
No headache at any time.
He was immediately taken to a local physician, and in two
days some vision returned, but six days later this left him
entirely. He was then removed to a hosj^ital, and while
there had a return of light perception. This remained for
two weeks, when six teeth were roentgenologically condemned
for removal. When the dentist pulled the first tooth the
patient's light-perception immediately vanished, and he says
blindness has been absolute ever since.
Jan., 1926 A Case of Hysterical Amaurosis 7
During his time in hospital, Dr. Bayley says, the patient is
alleged to have developed the power to " determine the colour of
objects through the sense of touch." This faculty Dr. Bayley
tested with negative results. Being puzzled by absolute " blind-
ness, with nothing to show for it, and normal pupillary reactions,"
Dr. Bayley called in an ocuUst, and " strong suspicions developed
of either malingering or hysteria."
The manner in which a cure was efEected is thus described by
Dr. Bayley :
At the time appointed he was taken into my office alone
facing against the well-lighted window. Dr. Mackenzie then
placed on the patient's nose a test frame with two strong
prisms, and directed him to fix his eyes straight ahead. Soon
we noticed increased lacrymation. Then as Dr. Mackenzie
moved one prism, I noticed a concomitant muscular movement
in the other eye. The patient remarked, " I feel something
twitch." " Yes," I said dramatically, " and each time you
feel that twitch you will see a flash of light." Soon he saw
the flash of light. After a few repetitions, I said, " Now you
will see the light of the window. Now you will see the
window itself," and the suggestion worked. . . .
Vision was restored in this way in about twenty minutes ;
so that when he got out of the chair he could see everything.
He rushed excitedly into the waiting-room to his mother and
uncle who were waiting for him, and immediately wanted to
phone to his wife that now he would be able to see her and
their child.
Dr. Bayley discusses the question of malingering, but concludes,
as a result of enquiry and observation, that this explanation is
improbable.
REVIEW.
The Wisdom of the Gods. By H. Dennis Bradley. (T. Werner
Laurie Ltd.).
Mr. Bradley divides his book into two parts : the first gives an
account of his sittings with various mediums of various reputations
during 1924 and 1925, and of the development of his own medium-
istic powers ; the second deals with Valiantine's visit to England
8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan., 1926
in 1925, when, as on his previous visit, Mr. Bradley acted as his
impresario. This part contains Mr. Bradley's account of the S.P.R.
investigation of VaUantine, and should be read in conjunction with
Part 97 of Proceedings.
The position of such an impresario is a delicate one, and doubly
so when he is, like Mr. Bradley, himself a medium. It demands
qualities of patience and even temper which Mr. Bradley by his
own confession does not possess. This comes out clearly whenever
the S.P.R. is mentioned.
Several months before Valiantine came to England Mr. Bradley
was invited to have his own powers investigated by the S.P.R. ;
but at a sitting on the 18th October, 1924, at which he was the
medium, he was advised by his own " control " to refuse. He
entered upon the S.P.R. investigations of Valiantine in a frame of
mind which made success most improbable. The seance room, he
complains, looked new : a gauze cage, which had been used in
the investigations of Willy Schneider (see Proc. Part 97) terrified
him : he was certain that a luminous spot on the wall, which
merely indicated the place of the electric light switch, was a trap
of some kind. No explanations, however complete as to the
purpose of the cage or the spot, could dispel his idees fixes :
his feelings became too much for him, and he " smashed " the
first sitting in " fury."
When the S.P.R. sittings were transferred to Mr. Bradley's house
things went a little better, but after a very few more sittings
Mr. Bradley decided " that he could not concede any further time
to these experiments v/ith the Society, whilst many of the great
intellects of Great Britain were kept waiting for their personal
experience." Valiantine was allowed no say in the matter : he
was quite willing to " concede " more time and sittings to the
Society, but the imperious impresario interjjosed his veto.
We turn with expectancy to Mr. Bradley's " great intellects of
Great Britain " to find that, apart from Mr. Bradley's domestic circle
and a round dozen members of the S.P.R., the sitters were com-
posed approximately as follows : fifteen stage celebrities, eight writers
(not perhaps of quite the first rank), one artist (ditto), one county
cricketer, one parliamentary candidate, several score of doubtless
worthy people unknown to fame, one anonymous statesman (" one
of the few really great men of intellect in Britain "), and last,
but of course not least, Mr. Haunen Swaffcr, as to whom see
Jan., 1926 Eevieio 9
Journal for November 1925. The anonymous statesman received
from a truly " great man " recently dead the message, " You must
use every endeavour to stop those wars. Tell . Tell the ":
a highly characteristic utterance, as will be generally agreed.
One of the sitters was an expert in finger prints, who examined
the impress of a " spirit hand " on a sheet of paper, but might
have been more usefully employed in examining the trumpets used
at the seances for marks of finger-prints, spiritual or carnal.
Mr. Bradley seems to have little idea as to what tests of
genuineness should be applied to mediumship of Valiantine's type.
He complains of some of the S.P.R. sitters that their main ex-
perience had been of physical phenomena, which he says do not
interest him, and of others that they had only sat with mediums
of the type of Mrs. Leonard. He fails to realise that trumpet
mediumship is ordinary trance mediumship accompanied by physical
phenomena. So far as the phenomena are mental they must be
studied as e.g. Mrs. Leonard's have been, practically verbatim
notes of each sitting being taken and placed on record. So far
as they consist of the production of voices from trumpets moving
about the room, they are physical, and, unless occurring under
the recognised conditions of control for physical mediumship, are
not worth consideration. Sir Oliver Lodge seems to have made a
valiant effort to get this into Mr. Bradley's head, but only to
have succeeded in arousing his temprt".
\- The question of the genuineness of Valiantine's powers must be
considered open. If, for instance. Lady Troubridge's record in
Proc. Part 97 is read, it will be seen that the medium made some
fairly good hits, and one very bad mistake, viz., when his " Feda
control " mistook Mrs. WooUey for Miss Walker, whose place at
the sitting Mrs. WooUey had taken at short notice. Incidentally
Mr. Bradley reports this incident incorrectly :
" Feda-Valiantine
"
first said " Raymond . . . wants to speak to Miss Walker," and
only after this remark had caused a sensation was this altered to
" Raymond . . . wants to send a message to Miss Walker." On
two other occasions the controls made somewhat similar blunders :
when a Mr. Whaddia was addressed by the control as "
Mr.
Maddia," and when Miss Rebecca West was addressed by a "
grand-
father West " who never existed, her name being a nom-de-guerre.

CORRESPONDENCE.
I. A Coincidence.
To the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.
Madam,—In the little coincidences of everyday life we experience
our mild surprise because a connecting link we feel should be
there is missing. It is missing either because it does not exist
or because we fail to notice it. Our surprise in the two cases
is the same. Normally, the more striking the coincidence the
more disposed are we to suspect the existence of an unnoticed
link. I give here, however, an instance which, though it seems
to me striking, appears attributable only to accident.
On the evening of (I believe) 18th Sept., 1925, my sister was
" listening in " with ear-phones, when she remarked to my mother
that the wireless had just given a song which she had learnt as
a child, but, until then, had never heard since. She quoted a
line which from memory I quote thus : "A green (?) apple tree
grew out of his grave." At that moment I was reading the
following sentence which appears on p. 270 of Byioays of British
Archaeology, by Walter Johnson (Cambridge University Press, 1912)
:
" Not quite so well known is the theory that we have derived
our custom of placing shrubs on graves from our heathen fore-
fathers of the Bronze Age, who were wont to plant trees on their
burial mounds."
I will give in some detail the immediate steps I took to fix the
incident in my memory. [An incident of a few days earlier date
had left me with the determination to record briefly and for my
own use cases of coincidence personally experienced.]
(ft) I at once (i.e. without finishing even the sentence) laid down
my book to listen to the conversation ; from which, I gathered,
the song may be called " Cromwell's grave," and contains such
refrains as " Hippity-hop " or " Lippity-lop."
(6) I made no remark of any sort to those present, nor have
J since, concerning this incident.
(c) When the conversation on that topic ended, I read to the
end of the sentence, i.e. the word " mounds," and no further.
{(1) I immediately wrote a very brief account to a friend. I
cannot remember if I caught the 9.0 p.m. or 4.4.5 a.m. post from
the neighbouring pillar-box.
Jan., 1926 Correspondence 11
One does not read word by word, but from the nature of the
case, I must at (a) at any rate have reached the words " shrubs
on graves," while I believe the specific mention of the Bronze
Age was noticed after picking up the book again (c).
The wireless was received from Daventry, there was no loud-
speaker, my sister alone was listening in.
I had probably been reading for about a quarter of an
hour, and had begun at the place at which I had previously
left off.
One small, though perhaps not unimportant point, I cannot
determine, whether I stopped reading to listen to the conversation
before I was aware of the nature of my sister's remarks ; but
I laid down the book only after realising that there was coinci-
dence.
In case they may interest you I enclose the name of the friend
to whom I wrote [d), and some extracts, etc., from the book in
question which bear on the point.

II. A Forgotten Memory Revived in a Dream.
To the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.
February 7, 1925.
Madam,—Some years ago my niece undertook to hand-print me
some Christmas cards to send away ; when finished she mislaid
them ; I inquired about them, but she told me she could not
find them. One day, when she entered the room, I said :
" I c?o
wish you could find those cards." I was rather surprised that
she did not reply, but left the room abruptly. After a few
minutes she returned with them in her hand, and said that when
I spoke she suddenly remembered that on the previous night she
dreamed that she saw them in a certain book. On recalling her
dream she at once went to look for them, and found them there.
H. A. Dallas.
III. To the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.
Madam,—I have spent some days considering Lady Grey's
reply to my letter but find little help in her explanation, which
merely, as it seems to me, moves the responsibility one step
backwards. The problem is this : errors obviously due to mis-
hearing of the English language occur fairly frequently in com-
munications. Since the transmission of the message, at least at
the source, is supposed to be independent of spoken sound, how
is this to be explained ? I fancy that the point is worthy of
consideration, since the correct explanation may throw much light
on the mechanique of communication, while the failure to explain
it must tend to discredit the messages.

ELECTION OF DR. HANS DRIESCH AS PRESIDENT.
Our new President is already well known in England, where
he has many friends, and some of our members may remember
hearing his lectures (in English) before the Universities of Lon-
don and Cambridge in 1913, on The Problem of Individuality."
More recently he lias published a further series of lectures
entitled " The Crisis in Psychology," reviewed in the S.P.R. Journal
for December, 1925. Dr. Driesch is distinguished both as a
biologist and as a psychologist, and he has always emphasised
the value of the contribution which Psychical Research has
made to recognised science. Formerly Professor of Philosophy
at Heidelberg, he is now Professor of Philosophy at Leipsig.
The Society is fortunate in having secured so eminent a
President for the current year.
We feel sure that our Members will welcome the oppor-
tunity of hearing Dr. Driesch' s Presidential Address to be
given on the 18th of March at the house of the British
Medical Association. Particulars as to obtaining tickets for
visitors will be found on the front page of this Journal.

ANNUAL GENEKAL MEETING OF MEMBEKS.
The Annual General Meeting of Members of tbe Society was
held at 31 Tavistock Square, London, W.C., on Friday,
January 29th, 1926, at 3.30 p.m. ; The President in the
chair. The following Members were present : Mr. W. W.
Baggally, Mr. Besterman, Mr. E. J. Dingwall, Mrs. E. J.
Dingwall, the Hon. Everard Feilding, the Kev. W. S. Irving,
Miss Jephson, Sir Lawrence Jones, Bart., Mrs. Leaning, Mr.
W. H. Salter, Miss Scatcherd, Mrs. Henry Sidgwick, and Dr.
V. J. Woolley (and, by proxy. Miss Balfour, Lord Balfour,
the Right Hon. G. W. Balfour, Dr. T. W. Mitchell, The
Dowager Lady Rayleigh).
The Chairman presented the Report of the Council. Mr.
W. H. Salter read the Report of the Council to the Meeting.
The Hon. Treasurer (Mr. W. H. Salter) in presenting the
Financial Statement said that he had nothing remarkable to
report this year. We could not expect to receive every year
as much by donations as in 1923 and 1924 : this year we
gratefully acknowledged a gift of £200 from a member who
wished to remain anonymous.
The Society started the year with a balance in hand of
£364 and ended with a balance of £703, an increase of £339.
Part of this increase was due to the donation of £200, and
also a legacy of £50. On the other hand there had been
exceptional expenses in finishing the building of the Seance
Room, which amounted to £68, and so it might be estimated
that the net increase in our income this year stood at about
£140. LTnder the circumstances of financial retrenchment
now necessary in all ranks of life, and the fact that we were
passing out of the unhealthy period of excitement over all
occult matters which followed immediately after the war, on
the whole one might say that this was a very satisfactory re-
sult. Discussion of the Repoii; was invited.
The Chairman announced that the six retiring Members of
Council offered themselves for re-election. No other nomina-
Feb., 1926 Annual General Meeting of Members 17
tions having been received, the following were declared to be
duly elected Members of the Council : the Hon. Everard
FeUding, Dr. L. P. Jacks, Professor Gilbert Murray, Mr. J. G.
Piddington Dr. F. C. S. SchiUer, and Dr. M. B. Wright.
ANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1925.
The year has been marked by the death of Sir William Barrett,
the last survivor of the founders of the Society and of its first
Council. The Society in its forty-third year has thus entered
on what from a sentimental point of view may be described
as a new epoch—though without change in its aims or method,
which continue what they have been throughout. This is not
the place to review the Society's work during those years, but
the Coimcil may be allowed to note with satisfaction the
e\'idence of increasing recognition of that work by philosophers,
psychologists and men of science in England and abroad, and
the increasing degree in which, largely as the results of that
work, telepathy at any rate is regarded as a fact to be
reckoned with, though we as yet know so little about it.
Mr. Piddington, when his first year as President came to an
end, was asked to retain the office for the year 1925, and to
our great satisfaction consented to do so.
The ordinary work of the Society has gone on through the
year much as usual. Though we should like to have more
workers, we cannot complain of any falling off, and are glad
to welcome to the ranks of oru: active workers Mr. S. G. Soal,
who has contributed the valuable study on certain supernormal
commimications of which part was read at a meeting in July,
and which was published in December.
We have to thank other members for material received.
Mr. W. S. Irving has allowed us to have records of communi-
cations received by himself thi'ough Mrs. Leonard and other
mediums, in which the communicator attempts to throw light
on the modus operandi of communicating. Mrs. Salter reported
on these at a meeting in February, and it is hoped that her
report wiU shortly be pubHshed. Several other members have
sent us, or have shown to Miss Newton, notes of sittings with
Mrs. Leonard often too private and intimate, or for other
18 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Feb., 1926
reasons unsuitable, for publication. Though it cannot be
published, information thus furnished may be of real value in
extending our knowledge of Mrs. Leonard's trance-phenomena,
and making a comparative study of different sittings possible.
We wish to thank members who have communicated private
records for their willingness thus to help in the Society's
work.
Other evidence bearing on our work has been received, and
as usual some of it has been, or will be, printed in the Journal
or Proceedings, and other cases have been filed for reference.
Mr. G. H. Breaker, a member of the Society residing in Texas,
U.S.A., had the ingenious idea of trying to get, through a
medium, particulars concerning a distant place which had been
known to his deceased father and grandfather but not to him-
self. He afterwards visited the place and found that much of
what the medium had said about it in a series of sittings was
correct, and he was considerably impressed. Unfortunately the
value of topographical details, for the most part of a not uncom-
mon kind, is difficult to estimate, and it does not seem to us at
present that the results are sufficiently conclusive to justify
pubhcation. The case can, however, be studied at the Society's
rooms, with Mr. Breaker's annotations and estimates of success.
We have also to thank certain members for assistance given
to the Society's officers by enquiring into cases. In particular
Mr. Fryer has, as often before, looked into cases reported in
the press and elsewhere, and Mr. Henry Bury has done valu-
able work by calling upon contributors of cases and talking
over with them the experiences in question. Even when
enquiries show a case to be worthless evidentially, the reports
on it are generally worth filing, and a personal interview often
results in more relevant information being obtained than would
be possible by correspondence, and the case may be thereby
improved.
The experiments in thought-transference at the Society's
rooms were continued under Miss Newton's guidance during the
greater part of the year, but they have not been successful
in throwing light on the conditions in which telepathy is likely
to occur, which was the object for which they were originally
devised. A certain amount of apparent telepathy has, how-
Feb., 192(3 Annual Report of the Council for 1925 19
ever, been observed, and Miss Newton will be glad to hear
from any members wbo think they may have power either as
percipients or agents and would hke to test it.
In the course of these experiments Miss Ina Jephson thought
that, aiming at telepathy, she had several times received
successful impressions at the moment when the agent drew a
card from a pack and before he had seen it. This looked like
clairvoyance, and to test this possibility Miss Jephson has tried
a long series of experiments on herself and others with results
suggesting some supernormal perception. We hope that later she
will send a detailed account of her experiments to the Society.
Thanks to the generosity of one of our members some
sittings were held mth the American medium Mr. George
Valiantine, who was at the time the guest of Sir. Dennis
Bradley. The results were meagre but not without some
interest. An account of the sittings has just been published
in Proceedings, Part 97. Turning to physical phenomena, a
series of experiments was carried out in April and May with
the Polish medium, Janusz Fronczek, invited to England for
the purpose. The results were unsatisfactory. An account
of these experiments has just been pubhshed in Proceedings,
Part 97, together with that of the experiments with WilK
Schneider in 1924.
January and part of February were spent by Mr. Dingwall
in America, sitting with the Boston medium " Margery " (Mrs.
L. R. Gr. Crandon). The expenses of the journey were met by
a member of the Society Living in Boston, who also entertained
Mr. Dingwall during his visit.
A report of the inquiry was drawn up by Mr. Dingwall and
will be published in Proceedings.
In the autumn ]\Ir. Dingwall visited Austria and had sittings
in their own homes with Willi and Rudi Schneider and Frau
Maria SUbert. Some interesting and suggestive phenomena
were observed with the Schneider brothers, but the sittings
mth Frau Silbert were inconclusive.
The Research Officers have visited several places in different
parts of England where unexplained physical phenomena were
alleged to occur, but their enquiries have not yet resulted in
suitable material for publication.

22 Jovbrnal of Society for Psychical Research Fkb., 1926
The Council was asked by Mr. Bligh Bond to consider evi-
dence presented by him regarding the position of supposed
buried treasure at Glastonbury Abbey, with a view to stating
whether there appeared to be a case justifying him in applying
for leave to excavate. The Council appointed a Committee
who reported that the data already obtained present a case
for pursuing the search, hitherto conducted by dowsers, by
excavation.
We wish to remind Members and Associates of the sugges-
tion that they should form groups among themselves for
informal discussion of different branches of Psychical Kesearch.
Mr. Trethewy has organised a group for historical study.
In addition to the generous financial help referred to in
connexion with the sittings with Mr. Valiantine and with
" Margery," the Society has received a donation of over £200
from a member who wishes to remain anonymous, and of £25
and £10 from two American members. The Council desire to
express their appreciation of these gifts, and of the special
annual subscriptions which three members of the Society have
contribiited annually for many years. They also record with
appreciation a legacy of £50 which w^as left to the Society by
their former colleague. Dr. Charles Lloyd Tuckey, whose Obi-
tuary is printed in the Journal for October, 1925.
One Corresponding Member was elected during the year
:
Dr. Eugene Osty ; and one Honorary Associate : Signor E.
Bozzano. Eighty-one ordinary Members were elected—an
increase on recent years—and five Associates became Members.
On the other hand, we have lost by death twenty-one Members
and Associates, including one Honorary Member (Sir William
Barrett), one Corresponding Member (M. Camille Flammarion),
two Honorary Associates (Dr. Sydney Alrutz and Dr. C. Lloyd
Tuckey) and several members of long standing, including the
E,ev. David Cathels, Mrs. George Drewry, Mr. Robert Lodge,
The O'Neill de Tyrone, Mr. Ion Perdicaris, and Mr. Adolph
Smith. The names of eleven Members and six Associates
have been struck off the lists owing to non-payment of their
subscriptions ; and thirty Members and fourteen Associates have
resigned. The total membership of the Society now stands at
1124, of whom 604 are Members, and 520 are Associates.
Feb., 192G Annual Report of the Council for 1925 23
Four Parts of Proceedings were published during the year :
Part 92 in January, Part 94 in May, Part 95 in July, and
Part 96 in December.
The sale of the Society's publications at half price to Mem-
bers and Associates realised £81 17s. 2d. ; to the public, by Mr.
Prancis Edwards, £108 16s. 6d. ; and in America, by the
F. W. Faxon Co., £62 5s. 6d. The total, £252 19s. 2d.,
compares favourably with the totals of £117 10s. 4d. in 1924,
£168 3s. lid. in 1923, and £169 Is. 5d. in 1922. The increase
in 1925 is chiefly owing to the number of single volumes of
Proceedings and Journal that were sold during the year ; on
one occasion only was a complete set asked for. The sales
of Lord Dunraven's book, " Experiences in Spiritualism with
D. D. Home," account for £15 of the amount realised by sales
to the public, and £14 of the amount received from America.
(It should be added that these sums represent only the number
of copies sold up to Midsummer 1925. The returns for later
sales, which have not yet been received, will be included in
the Keport for 1926.)
One General Meeting, four Private Meetings, and two Con-
versaziones have been held during the year.
January 14th. A Conversazione.

obtained through Mrs. Leonard," by Mrs. W. H. Salter.

NOTES ON PERIODICALS.
The Revue Metapsychique for November-December has an account
by Dr. Osty of certain war predictions made in Athens in 1914 by
a young lady under the care of Dr. Antoniou. Certain of these
24 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Feb., 1926
statements, which were made in hypnotic trance, were published
in two of the Greek newspapers and are translated in the present
article. They reveal a number of errors, striking omissions, and
facts which afterwards proved to be correct. These latter appear
to Dr. Osty to be so striking that he asks whether the better
theory is to suppose that the whole is due to chance coincidence
or that a supernormal power was indicated in the experiments.
In the same number is published an article by M. Sudre on
the glossary of terms used in psychical research, which promises
to arouse a lively controversy ; and also an account of a very
remarkable test with the Polish medium Ossowiecki, in which the
latter indicated knowledge, apparently supernormally acquired, of
the result of a photograph which was presented to him in its
undeveloped state on the original plate, protected in a light-proof
covering. Not only did the medium show some knowledge of the
actual picture, but also he gave a description of certain incidents
which occurred at the time the plate was exposed and which
were proved correct.
In the same issue is an account of an undeveloped child with
abnormal powers of musical appreciation.
Under the title of the Zeitschrift fur kritischen Ohhultismus appears
a new German periodical which is especially welcome. The editor
is Dr. Baerwald of Berlin, and amongst its supporters are Dr.
Max Dessoir, Count Carl von Klinckowstroem and others. It will
appear at quarterly intervals, and will contain critical and scientific
surveys of modern literature and mediumistic investigations.
The first number is of such a high quality that this journal is
likely to take a leading place in German occult periodicals. Dr.
Max Dessoir contributes an account of the alleged clairvoyant
faculties of Frau Helene Schnelle, and Dr. Bohn has an interesting
account of the history of apport mediumship. He considers
apports the most remarkable and the most suspicious of all super-
normal phenomena, and collects some of the sources of information
regarding them from Dr. Dee to the present day. On a paper
on the so-called Od-rays, Hofmann examines some of the evidence
alleged to favour the existence of these emanations, and comes
to the conclusion that the supposed mechanical work which (it is
said) can be performed by them has not been adequately demon-
strated.
Dr. Albert Hellwig, the Potsdam lawyer, contributes some
Fbb., 1926 Notes on Periodicals 25
reflections on the Moll-Rudloff trial, witli special reference to the
part played in one of the sittings by Dr. P. Siinner and Dr. Carl
Bruck.
The second issue of the same Zeitschrift has a critical and dis-
cerning account by Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo on certain
experiments in clairvoyance with a private medium. The methods
of the medium, which have in many respects a close resemblance
to those employed by Mrs. Hester Dowden, are carefully recorded,
and the Count completes his survey of the evidence by an acute
analysis of certain fundamental facts which are often entirely
overlooked or partially neglected. Although some may question
certain conclusions of the Count regarding the a priori impossi-
bility of some remarkable phenomena, it may plausibly be urged
that this view is founded upon a misconception of the true
meaning that is attached to certain expressions by those who
attempt to describe the phenomena. However that may be, few
will dissent from the Count's vigorous attack on the '"
laws
"'
supposed by spiritualists to govern the phenomena in question,
"laws" which, he says, are invented either to favour the occur-
rence of fraud or to help out an unskilful medium when he has
been discovered in flagranti delicto. In the same number is an
interesting discussion by the editor, Dr. Baerwald, on the powers
of the imconscious, and also some useful notes by Count Klinckow-
stroem on the recent exposure of Guzik in Cracow. When con-
fronted with the flashlight photographs showing how he had
succeeded in evading the control of his hands, Guzik is said to
have remarked :
" Well, yes, I helped myself out ! Everybody
does it." In Count Klinckowstroem's notes on the case he com-
pares the facts with those ascertained in the cases of Kathleen
Goligher, Eva C, Palladino and the Schneider Brothers, although
it cannot be said that the control of Willi Schneider suffers from
the same weaknesses as those of Guzik. Dr. Tischner continues
his article on method in psychical research, and Dr. Hellwig
contributes a characteristic note on the Drost trial.
Psychische Studien for December has an article bv General Peter
of Munich on the genuineness of spirit photography, with especial
reference to the " beautiful evidential cases of psychic photo-
graphy " provided by the medium, George Moss, at the British
College of Psychic Science, Ltd. The author discusses the experi-
ments with the so-called magnetized plates," and expresses his
26 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Feb., 1926
belief in the authenticity of the results, basing his judgment upon
the often-repeated assurances that there was no possibility of fraud.^
The same issue publishes some interesting notes on the recent
Drost trial in Germany, and a remarkable history of a series of
rustling and crackling sounds in a basket, which the author
apparently believes were supernormal and, in a sense at least,
controllable by the will.
Psychischen Studien for January appears in a new dress. It is
now called the Zeitschrift fur Parapsychologie, and appears to be
supported by a number of prominent Continental savants. It
would be interesting to discover whether any of these distinguished
persons have protested against the publication in the present issue
of a translation of an account by an American, Professor Pawlowski,
of certain phenomena said to occur with the Polish medium,
Kluski. These stories have already appeared in English in two
periodicals, and contain material of an unusual character. Thus
the materialized lion (sic) at Kluski's sittings behaved on one
occasion in a threatening manner, beating his tail and striking
the furniture. The squirrel (also materialized) was, however, very
natural, and the phantom dogs were most affectionate, sitting on
the laps of the observers and wagging their tails. The full form
materialisations were most impressive. Judging from their steps
and the inertia of their bodies. Prof. Pawlowski thinks they had
normal weight, but when the mood took them they flew above
the heads of the ecstatic sitters, executing fancy evolutions, and
thus providing, as the professor expresses it, "a beautiful sight,
a kind of aerial ballet [Ein schoner Anblick, eine Art Luftballett].^
In the same issue Baron von Schrenck-Notzing publishes a
report of supposed poltergeist phenomena in the presence of a
fifteen year old girl in a small village in Upper Bavaria. He
visited the village and attempts were made to hold sittings,
but from the account it can hardly be said that the results were
1 It ought to be added that at least four months before General Peter's
article the medium Moss was exposed, confessed, and was dismissed from
his employment.
^ Such stories were common in the middle half of the nineteenth century,
although M. Kluski seems to be almost alone in his materializations of the
inhabitants of the jungle. At a seance in 1855 the medium, whilst under
control, mounted a buffet, which proceeded to gallop round the room in
the manner of a horse clearing about 1| yards at every jump. {York.
Sp. Teleg., Aug. 1855, p. 65.)
Feb., 1926 Notes on Periodicals 27
in any way conclusive. Dr. Tischner prints his address delivered
at tie Drost trial, and a short note is published concerning a
Hungarian poltergeist case which is apparently exciting much
attention in Vienna.
The Journal of the A.S.P.R. has an interesting account of the
voice-control machine invented by Dr. Mark Richardson of Boston
for verifying the independent voice alleged to be j^roduced at the
sittings with the medium Margery." There are certain technical
points of great importance in this device, but above all the
methods demanded by Walter (the Control) for using it are sug-
gestive. It would be worth trying to discover whether normal
methods could be employed to free the medium's mouth under
the precise conditions observed at the sittings. In his discussion
of the device Dr. Richardson apparently believes that aU normal
methods have been eliminated, and in this he is supported by
Mr. Bird, although both craters do not appear to consider the
possibility that by their attention to the apparatus they may be
neglecting certain fundamental points in the method of using that
apparatus. However that may be, both Dr. Mark Richardson
and Mr. Bird have failed to find any loophole for trickery in the
device, and the next step would seem to be to vary the con-
ditions under the Control's direction until the independence of the
voice becomes self-evident in a convincing demonstration.
In the same issue Dr. Thirring of Vienna discusses the exposure
of the medium Karl Krauss, and also gives a sketch of the
accusations levelled against Rudi Schneider by Dr. Przibram and
others. The issue concludes with a review of the Hoagiand-Code
alleged exposure of Margery " in Boston, in which the new
point is brought out that the supposed private interview between
Code and " Margery "'
was overheard by a third person, and that
this third party's affidavit disposes of Code's story of Margery's
"
alleged confession and of Code's duplicity.
In the issue of September 9, 1925, of the Wiener Allgemeine
Zeitung appears an article by Professor Freud on the occult
significance of the dream. Two classes of dreams, he says, should
be included amongst occult phenomena, the prophetic dream and
those showing the influence of telepathy. Freud thinks that the
evidence for the former class is not nearly so strong as that for
the latter. Indeed, the evidence for telepathy is not only found in
dreams, but in both spontaneous waking cases and actual experi-
Journal of Society for Psychical Research Feb., 1926
nients. Occasionally, however, the connection between a x^rophetic
and clearly telepathic dream is only to be seen through an analysis
of the statements made by the dreamer, or the medium, as the
case may be. In order to illustrate his meaning, Freud gives an
actual case in which one of his patients related how some years
before she had consulted a medium in a Parisian hotel. The
medium appears to have been more what is called in this country
a fortune-teller, and the information relative to the sitter's future
was in certain respects direct and precise. The prophecies, how-
ever, were not fulfilled, and in the course of the psycho-analytic
treatment Freud claims to have discovered their origin in the
unconscious wishes of the patient, who apparently, according to
his theory, passed them on to the medium telepathically, who
reproduced them as prophecies. It is through the exercise of
psycho-analysis that Freud looks for light on the more obscure
telepathic processes. B. J. j)
REVIEW.
The Religion of Health. An Examination of Christian Science.
By Sir William Barrett, completed by Miss R. M. Barrett.
(Dent. 3s. 6d. net.)
Although the subject is not very closely connected with psychical
research, many of our Members cannot fail to be interested in
Sir William Barrett's latest, and unfortunately last, book.
Sir William introduces the subject by a consideration of the
philosophic aspect of Christian Science, comparing and contrasting
it with various types of idealistic philosophy which deny the
ultimate reality of matter, and proceeds to a discussion of its
relation to the more generally accepted forms of Christianity.
An interesting account is given of Mrs. Eddy's curious life-story,
and of the spread of the movement, and the latter part of the
book discusses therapeutic treatment by different systems of faith-
healing and suggestion. This part of the book will be of par-
ticular interest to our readers, in view of the large part which,
as Sir William points out, Members of the S.P.R. have always
played in this branch of therapeutics.
The book is, as might have been expected, at once sympathetic
and critical, and many who are not followers of Mrs. Eddy will
find it helps them to understand better a movement which has
made such astonishing growth in our time. W. H. S.

JOURNAL
OF THE
Society for Psychical Research
CONCERNING MR. S. G. SOAL'S REPORT ON SITTINGS
WITH MRS. COOPER.
We are proposing to print in the Journal several letters we
have received concerning Mr. Soal's paper in Proceedings,
Part 96, including a criticism by Mr. H. D. Bradley and a reply
by Mr. Soal.
Mr. Bradley's criticism has already appeared in the issue
of Light of the 6th February, where it was accompanied
by passages imputing unworthy motives to the Society : we
are glad to note that in his present article Mr. Bradley tacitly
drops these imputations.
In view of the interest Mr. Soal's paper has aroused, we
feel justified in departing from our usual practice by printing
an article substantially the same as one which has already
appeared in another periodical. We must, however, remind our
Members that controversies arising out of articles printed by
the Society can most suitably be conducted in the Society's
own Journal or Proceedings, where differences of opinion can be
discussed frankly but courteously.
AN ANALYSIS OF THE EXPERIMENTS OF MR. S. G. SOAL,
M.A., B.Sc.
By H. Dennis Bradley.
In view of the various assumptions and asseverations contained in
Mr. Seal's report, it is necessary to analyse the evidence he
advances, and also to consider the sources from which it was
obtained.
Mrs. Blanche Cooper, the medium with whom Mr. Soal held
all his sittings, is what is termed a " voice " medium.
30 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Maroh, 1926
Mr. Soal does not question the genuineness of this naedium, who
practises at the British College of Psychic Science, but it is well
known to many psychical researchers that she is not a very fully
or powerfully developed medium.
As Mr. Soal correctly states, on the occasions when voices
manifest they are only heard for a minute or two at a time,
and such information as is given comes through in rapid snatches,
and the " voice " seldom speaks in complete sentences.
At the majority of the sittings held by Mr. Soal, only he and
the medium were present. On the one occasion when eight persons
were present, Mr. Soal admits that those who were not sitting
in the immediate vicinity of the person to whom the " voice
"
was speaking could not hear the words which were spoken.
During the entire series of Mr. Seal's sittings with Mrs. Blanche
Cooper, whenever a " voice " spoke, a musical box placed in
the room was playing the whole of the time. It will be realised,
from the faintness of the " voices " (which could not be heard by
others in the room), and from the added distraction of music
playing at the same time, that Mr. Soal's hearing had to be
particularly acute to distinguish what was said.
Under the difficulties of such circumstances, through which
misunderstandings could easily occur, it is a point of scientific
importance to note that there is no corroboration whatever of
the many statements made by Mr. Soal in his report.
At seventeen of the twenty sittings held by Mr. Soal with
the medium, Mrs. Cooper, only he and she were present. He is
therefore unable to call upon any witnesses to corroborate his
statements as to the phenomena which took place. This is a most
important point. With all my experience in psychic experiments
I should never dream, even now, of advancing any statement
whatever as evidence of supernormal phenomena unless I were
in a position to call upon other witnesses to confirm the state-
ments I had made.
It is one of the first principles of scientific and psychical
research that corroboration must be forthcoming before it can
be accepted as evidence.
Dealing with Mr. Soal's personal record he states that he has
an exceptional tendency to visualise words and articulate them
inaudibly. This tendency may have" proved a handicap to him
in his investigations.
Maech, 1926 Analysis of the Experiments of Mr. S. 0. Seal 31
JVIr. Soal states that Mrs. Cooper's supernormal faculties exercise
themselves almost entirely on trivial aspects in the lives of
deceased personalities, and that in no case did the medium's
trance-consciousness occupy itself with subjects of intellectual and
artistic interest. In fairness to the medium, however, it should
be noted that Mr. Soal only appears, according to his own report,
to have asked questions about trivial aspects, and in no case
did he appear to endeavour to stimulate artistic interest by any
of his conversations.
Mr. Soal, who, apparently, has had no other experiences of
" voice " phenomena, presumes in his record that This case
appears to emphasise the necessity of the existence of a physical
link relating the sitter to the deceased personality, and argues
the impossibility of obtaining in the absence of such a link
information about a deceased personality which is not already
present in the mind of the sitter."
This theory of Mr. Seal's has been disproved hundreds of times.
It is disproved in several instances in my book. The Wisdom
of the Gods, notably on page 403, when, on April 22nd, 192.5,
the purported spirit of Lord Curzon volunteered information
regarding Dr. John Everidge, which was entirely unknown to
any of the sitters, and which was afterwards proved to be correct.
In the series of sittings during which Mr. Soal records com-
munications in the " voice " through his deceased brother, he does
not criticise these in any way, but appears to accept them as
verifiable communications of an intelligent entity. It is when he
records the conversations with a fictitious communicator that his
criticism is aroused. The communicator, in this instance a
" voice " purporting to be a " John Ferguson," apparently gave
information which Mr. Soal found afterwards to be incorrect.
The communications given were terribly mixed and indefinite.
Many suggestions were put verbally by Mr. Soal to the communi-
cator, who was unable to answer many direct questions.
The following is a typical instance :
JIe. Soal. Where did you die ?
" Voice." My mind is confused. It was in a very large town.
Me. Soal. In Brentwood ?
" Voice." No, not Brent, quite another place,
and, at the next sitting :
Me. Soal. Do you mean the house in Brentwood ?
32 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Makch, 1926
" Voice." Yes, Brent.
At the following sitting, on November 24th, the " voice " of the
guide " Nada," in referring to " John Ferguson," said, " He is
awfully worried because he cannot remember things," and it
should here be noted that many of the communications were
made, not by the purported spirit of " John Ferguson," but by
the voice of " Nada."
The " voice " of " John Ferguson " only spoke for a minute or
two on the first four occasions, after which Mr. Soal appears to
have deliberately led this purported communicator on by various
forms of suggestion.
At a later sitting :
Me. Soal, I've just been to Brentwood and have found
out that neither you nor your brother ever
lived there. What do you say to that ?
" John Feequson." Pardon me, I did not say we lived there. We
had friends there.
During the series of sittings Mr. Soal was constantly suggesting
names and places to the " voices " of both " John Ferguson
"
and " Nada." This is a method which is never employed by an
expert investigator, and the attitude he maintained throughout
was certainly peculiarly brusque.
At the last of these sittings the following dialogue took place :
" Nada." It is wicked trying to confuse spirits.
Me. Soal. I didn't try to confuse him.
" Nada." I think you did.
" Voice " of Feank (Mr. Soal's brother). Think he got mixed up. . .
His mind was blank. He caught at any thoughts flying
round.
The somewhat lengthy records and notes made by Mr. Soal on
this case seem to be quite valueless.
It is simply a case of impersonation or of a muddled spirit
endeavouring to communicate. Impersonations often take place
when the medium is not fully developed.
The case of Gordon Davis is one of the most absurd instances
that I have ever read recorded in psychic literature. It is of
the utmost importance to criticise and scrutinise these communi-
cations and the unjustifiable deductions which Mr. Soal arrives at
March, 1926 Analysis of the Experiments of Mr. S. G. Soal 33
from them, because it is upon tliese communications that lie bases
a most illogical and ambitious claim.
This purported spirit, which Mr. Soal assumes to be that of a
living person, " Gordon Davis." only uttered twelve short sentences,
during the delivery of which a musical box was dinning its
melodies the whole time.
I have carefully checked the entire time which it would take
to enunciate these twelve sentences, and the time is fifty seconds.
Mr. Soal states that immediately this " voice " began to speak,
although the musical box was playing, he " had a lightning im-
pression that the tone was quite familiar to him." This appears
to me, as I shall show later, to be a very extraordinary assertion
to make.
I will quote verbatim, from Mr. Soal's report, the exact words
said by the " voice," which Mr. Soal advances as evidence of the
personality in question. I emphasise the word evidence.
" Voice." Remember Davis—Gordon from R—R—Roch—Roch
—
When this sentence was enunciated Mr. Soal states " This word
was not completed, but I easily understood it was an attempt to
say '
Rochford.'
"
Mr. Soal has no right whatever to assume any such thing, and
such an assumption is entirely contrary to the methods of any
expert investigator.
Directly the voice had said :
" Remember Davis—Gordon—

In replying to this sentence Mr. Soal said :

be carefully noted that Mr. Soal gave the name of Histed, whereas
the " voice " never mentioned the name of Histed, but only said
" Hs."

And when Mr. Soal says to the " voice," " What proof can you
give me that you are 'Davis'"? all that the "voice" can reply
is :
' Here, I must hold on—not used to this."
It is necessary here to draw attention to the fact that the
" voice " never gave the correct name, could not say where he
lived and did not give the name " Histed." All these names
were supplied and spoken by Mr. Soal. It is absolutely ludicrous
to base an argument upon such a flimsy basis. No scientific
investigator in the world would accept this nonsense.
After this one sitting the " voice " in question never spoke again.
At the- only other sitting at which Gordon Davis was discussed,
all the communications were given through the voice of the spirit
guide, called " Nada." It is therefore a case of absolute and
unjustifiable assumption on the part of Mr. Soal, based upon no
acceptable evidence whatever, that he should imagine that the
voice in question, which spoke for a few seconds only, was that
of Gordon Davis.
At the second sitting Mr. Soal deliberately asks for Gordon
Davis. During this sitting the voice of " Nada " gave many vague
references and descriptions which would certainly apply to in-
numerable small households and circumstances. During this sitting
Mr. Soal himself volunteered several leads and names given by
him which were not confirmed by the " Nada " communications.
Among the many vague descriptions he managed to elicit from
the " Nada " communications, some of the important points were
as follows :
" Nada." He says something about a funny dark tunnel—It is
to do with his house. There's five or six steps and a
half. Very large mirror and lots of pictures. Pictures
are all scenes (landscapes). Glorious mountains and
the sea—there's one picture where a road or something
seems to go between two hills. Some vases—very big
ones with funny tops and saucers, but not to drink
out of. There's a woman there now, and a little
boy. Believe it's a woman fond of the country—fond
of flowers—think it's his wife. Downstairs two funny
brass candlesticks—on a shelf—something right in front
of his house—not a verandah.
In answer to a question put by Mr. Soal regarding the '
wife
''
' Nada " replied that she could not describe her.
March, 1926 Analysis of the Experiments of Mr. S. G. Soal 35
Later, " Nada " says : (here again I quote verbatim)
Something about black dicky bird—think it's on the piano
—
not sure about it.
and again :
He's showing me the letter " E " and some figures, but I can't
see what they are. Two " E's ".
It is upon this terribly confused description that Mr. Soal
dares to assert that the voice gave an ''
accurate description of
the environment and interior arrangements of a house which he
(Gordon Davies ) did not occupy until a year later."
Mi. Soal asks for the address of the spirit as follows :
Mk. Soal. Could you give me the name of the street ?
" Nada." Get the letter " E's."
It is on such a reply as this that Mr. Soal assumes the address
to be " Eastern Esplanade.""
In the communications received a reference is made to a " funny
dark tunnel." This, Mr. Soal assumes, referred to a small open
archway leading from the front of the small surburban villa to
the back garden, with the daylight apparently penetrating through
from each end.
Mr. Soal states that when he interviewed the living Gordon
Davis some little time later, he notices that Mr. Davis used the
expression " old man " t\vice, and " old chap " once. In the few
short sentences spoken at the sitting by the voice," the term
old chap " was used in one of the sentences. Mr. Soal actually
advances the use of the term " old chap " as independent veri-
fication of a personality. It is almost inconceivable that any man
of intelligence could advance such an argument as the use of
the common term old chap " as a proof of identification.
When Mr. Soal discovered that Gordon Davis was still living
at Southend, he visited him there, but says, to use his own words :
" I then briefly explained about my '
direct voice ' sitting and
communicated to him (Gordon Davis) the somewhat astonishing
news that he himself had been the communicator at one of these
sittings."'
This is surely the most astounding statement that has ever
deliberately been made by even the most credulous of researchers.
There has never been a case before built upon such vague
suppositions.
36 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. March, 1926
Mr. Soal gives a long tabular analysis of what he calls evidence,
based upon the following points.
The " voice " of Nada told him that the communicator said to
him at a sitting :
" There is a woman there now and a little
boy. Believe it's a woman fond of the country and country
things—fond of flowers—think it's his wife."
There are tens of thousands of wives with a child and ninety-
nine out of a hundred women are fond of flowers.
When the real Gordon Davis was questioned regarding harpoons
—an unusual weapon—this was not confirmed. Davis merely says
that as a boy he collected various weapons, especially spears and
boomerangs, etc.
The word M—Ma—Malt—is assumed by Mr. Soal to mean not
even the name of a house, but the house in which Davis lived
and which had a malting at the back of it, and this house was
sometimes called " The Malting."
The only point which might possibly be assumed to indicate
any evidential reference whatever was the volunteering by the
" voice " of the name of Playle, but this sentence contained no
direct reference to Playle, which is a well known family name at
Rochford.
The reference made by the " voice " to the short conversation
in the train about a little confab on the work of Guards conveys
nothing whatever. Millions of people were talking about the work
of the Guards during the war.
In the " Nada " communication, which is assumed to refer to
the house which Gordon Davis was living in, a reference is made
to " something—not a verandah." This, Mr. Soal takes to be
an evidential reference to a seaside shelter which was opposite
the house.
The " voice " of Nada says :
" Something about black dicky bird—think it's on the piano
—
not sure about it."
This reference Mr. Soal regards as a strong evidential point.
The " black dicky bird " was not black at all. It was (I quote
Mr. Soal's own words) " a small ornament in the form of a
kingfisher, which stood on a black china pedestal."
Mr. Seal's report throughout is full of extraordinary mis-
statements. He asserts " the communicator was able to give
accurately the facts about the past life of Gordon Davis."
Makch, 1926 Analysis of the Experiments of Mr. S. G. Soal 37
No facts whatever were given. Mr. Soal states that the com-
municator gave the name of the house in Rochford. Another
deliberate mis-statement. The name was not given. It was
given by Mr. Soal himself.
Mr. Soal states that the voice of the communicator produced
characteristic mannerisms, accent, etc., and proceeds to assert that
" this, we (Mr. Soal, etc.), must consider to be in a certain sense
facts about the life of Gordon Davis, even though they were
expressed in dramatic form."' I must protest against the acceptance
of such a statement by Mr. Soal. It is ludicrous. The description
of the house which Mr. Soal describes as accurate is, on analysis,
found to be utterly inadequate. The address and the environment
were not given."
The " voice " was heard through the sounds of a musical box,
and, according to Mr. Soal's own report, he says that although he
and Gordon Davis were at school together, he hardly knew him,
and, throughout the whole of his life, he can only recall one
single conversation, and that, a conversation of half an hour,
which took place when he met him in a train in 1916 (nearly
six years before the sitting), travelling between Shenfield and
Liverpool Street.
It is extraordinary that although Mr. Soal says he cannot
recognise his brother's voice when the communications came
through, yet the only "voice" he asserts he did recognise was
the one which he found afterwards to be that of a living person.
Mr. Soal's imagination is built up entirely upon disjointed and
chaotic utterances.
The " voice " of the purported spirit of Davis Gordon or Gordon
Davis did not volunteer one correct name with the solitary excep-
tion of a vague reference to the surname Playle, of which name
there are many people. All the other names were verbally and
inferentially suggested by Mr. Soal, a most deplorable and inexpert
procedure which would never be countenanced by any scientific
psychic investigator. Mr. Soal even omitted to ask the names of
" the wife and the kiddie " who were referred to. A most obvious
question which could easily have been verified.
Upon these flimsy and even ridiculous snatches of conversation,
which as evidence would be derided and dismissed in any human
court of law, Mr. Soal bases his material arguments.
Yet, according to his report, Mr. Soal is still apparently con-
I
38 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Makch, 1926
fused in his own mind as to what he really does think, for he
commits two of the most blatant contradictions I have ever read.
In one part he says :
" It would be entirely illogical to describe
this case as one of '
communication ' by a living person. All we
are entitled to say is that a communication was received concerning
'
Gordon Da^ris.'"
Then, a little later, he says, " This dramatised personality
(Gordon Davis), so accurate in its other statements apparently
believes itself to be a deceased person."
It is easy to understand the confusion into which Mr. Soal
allowed his industrious imagination to entangle his mind, but it
is not easy to understand why he should presume to record a few
dull, unevidential and often incoherent utterances as evidence of
the telepathic or sub-conscious mind theories.
There is one further point which Mr. Soal must explain scienti-
fically. He does not appear to dispute the genuineness of the
medium. Nor does he appear to dispute the fact of supernormal
" voices " speaking from sj^ace. What scientific explanation does
he offer of the means by which the sub-conscious mind can create
an audible and intelligent sound from space ?
A REPLY TO MR. H. DENNIS BRADLEY.
By S. G. Soal.
Mr. Bradley, at the close of his criticism of the Gordon Davis
case, remarks that the evidence would be derided and dismissed
by any human court of law. Now in making this statement it
seems to me that Mr. Bradley shows a complete lack of historical
perspective in his total disregard of the kind of evidence which
psychical research has had to deal with in the past. The com-
parison with the court of law is misleading and irrelevant. Psychic
research during its fifty years of existence has hardly ever had
to consider the kind of clear, explicit and connected statement
that arises in a human court. It has had to consider evidence
that is always more or less elusive, and to deal with this evidence
it has perfected a technique that is based largely on the laws of
probability and the careful study of coincidences. What considera-
tion I ask Mr. Bradley would the book tests of Mrs. Leonard
receive in a human court ? Would they not also be derided and
March, 1926 A Reply to Mr. H. Dennis Bradley 39
dismissed ? Yet a careful experimental analysis of tHese tests based
on the theory of probability affords a scientific demonstration of
their supernormal character. A human court of law could have
arrived at no such conclusions by applying its ordinary methods
of procedure.
I venture to think that in vividness and clearness of detail my
records compare favourably with any that have been produced in
the past, and are not inferior in this respect to either the Piper
records or the Leonard reports. Indeed, T will go so far as to
say that had the details been more vivid and connected than is
actually the case grave suspicion would have been thrown on their
authentic character as psychic records. In the eyes of the serious
student the very excess of clearness and precision would probably
have appeared as a contradiction to all that has been taught us
by the past w-ith regard to the difficulties that arise in the
process of transmission.
In his criticism of the Gordon Davis case, Mr. Bradley seems to
l)e entirely unaware of the inevitable difficulties that are associated
with the telepathic and other methods of psychic transmission of
ideas. He expects, apparently, that proper names should be
given in full in every case, and he seems quite unaware that
experimental telepathy has established that it is often an associated
idea rather than the original idea that emerges in the mind of
the percipient. I will give an example. At the commencement of
the first sitting " Davis " speaks as follows :
" Remember the old
school ? How I always argued with H—H—Hs—Hs— oh, confound
those names—was for brighter geog—brighter geography—harpoons
and things."
Now it subsequently transpired that the real Gordon Davis,
according to his own story, had been exceptionally interested in
geography lessons at school, and to illustrate these lessons brought
to school spears, boomerangs, and other savage weapons. Mr.
Bradley, by the way, who professes to quote my record verbatim,
leaves out the important phrase, " Remember the old school ? " and
then most unfairly concludes that I had no right to assume
that the " Hs " syllable repeated at least twice was intended
for the name of our old geography master, Histed. Now without
any suggestion from myself Mr. Davis understood the whole
reference the moment he read it on the typed script—both the
name Histed and the reference to harpoons. It is what the phrases
40 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March, 192(>
convey to Mr. Davis and not what they convey to Mr. Bradley
that is important. What may possibly have happened is this.^
The fragment of memory that called itself Davis may have been
trying to recall the spear that was brought to school and the
similar weapons that the real Davis had collected. Unable tO'
hit upon the word spear or boomerang it is conceivable that the
" communicator " seized upon some associated memory, with the
result that " harpoons and things " was substituted as an approxi-
mation to the idea he wished to convey.
Now let us see how Mr. Bradley deals with this incident. He
says :
When the real Gordon Davis was questioned regarding
harpoons—an unusual weapon—this was not confirmed. Davis
merely said : that as a boy he collected various weapons, especially
spears and boomerangs, etc."
Having first omitted the phrase :
" Remember the old school,"
which is the key-note to the whole conversation, Mr. Bradley
now entirely ignores the obvious fact that the phrase " harpoons
and things " follows directly after the statement, " how I always-
argued with H—H—Hs—Hs— was for brighter geog—geography,"
and must be read in connection with it. The whole pith of the
matter lies in the fact that the real Gordon Davis actually
remembered bringing spears and other weapons to school in order
to brighten up our somewhat dull geography lessons. The sub-
stitution of the words " harpoons and things " for " spears and
things " caused Mr. Davis himself no difficulty in identifying the
allusion immediately he read it. From what we know of experi-
mental telepathy substitutions such as these are to be anticipated,
and a man who expects a psychic communicator to call a spade
a spade ought himself to be compelled to use one.
Before proceeding to the question of corroboration, I want to
analyse Mr. Bradley's attack on the Gordon Davis case.
Mr. Bradley begins by saying :
" I will quote verbatim, from
Mr. Soal's report, the exact words said by the '
voice,' which
Mr. Soal advances as evidence of the personality in question."
Mr. Bradley does not quote my record verbatim. He omits the
phrase, " Remember the old school ?
" and I shall show later on
that he deliberately alters the wording of a certain phrase in order
to make it fit in with a particular interpretation of his own.
Mr. Bradley says I had no right whatever to assume that the
syllable " Roch " was an attempt to give the name Rochford.
March, 1926 A Reply to Mr. H. Dennis Bradley 41
I make no such assumption. I merely record a coincidence. I do
not mention either the syllable " Koch " or the word Rochford
aloud during the whole of this sitting. I cannot help the word
Rochford coming into my mind. Mr. Bradley does not mention
that the syllable " Roch "—is given not only twice at the beginning
of the sitting, but also once in the middle, after an interval of
silence. When it is remembered that I had lived just outside
Rochford for years and had walked its streets thousands of times,
and that I knew Gordon Da^ds was brought up and bred at
Rochford, it would certainly appear that the coincidence is^_ a
rather remarkable one.
Mr. Bradley says :
" Mr. Soal actually advances the use of the
term '
old chap '
as independent verification of a personality."
Let me remind Mr. Bradley that this item is only one of a number
of noted coincidences between the mannerisms of the communi-
cator and the real Gordon Davis. Whether it is strong or weak,
it is my duty in a scientific record to note every coincidence.
Suppose, for instance, that it had turned out that the real Gordon
Davis had entertained a pet aversion to the phrase '
old chap '
—
•
as I happen to do myself. In that case I might have been
accused of suppressing an important piece of negative evidence.
It is the accumulation of coincidences slight in themselves which
together make up a case for the identity of personal mannerisms.
The total ensemble was so convincing to Mr. Davis that when he
read it he laughed heartily at the quaint parody of his own terms
of phrase.
Mr. Bradley goes on to say that the name of the house at
Rochford was not given, and that I am guilty of a mis-statement
in saying that it was. Now the actual conversation on this subject
reads as follows :
Mr. Soal. Try and tell me where you lived.
Voice. At Roch—you mean ?
Me. Soal. That will do. '
Xoic^. Near the M—Ma—Malt. .
Now at the time of the sitting I had not the slightest idea that
Mr. Davis had lived near the Malting at Rochford. I cannot,
therefore, be accused in this instance of mis-interpreting what was
said. I simply recorded it, yet when I showed this record to
Gordon Davis himself he immediately understood that the word
3Ialt stood for the Malting at Rochford. Ask any old Roch-
42 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March, 1926
fordian who remembers the days when Gordon Davis lived at
Rochford, where in Rochford the house was, and he will reply,
I will wager, in nine cases out of ten, " near the Malten/'
(dialect for Malting). I produce a piece of definite evidence on
this point. On February 16th, 1926, I addressed a letter to Mr.
T. B. C. Histed, a well-known and respected resident of Rochford,
who has lived there for upwards of thirty years. Mr. Histed has
not read my report as it apjaears in the Proceedings, but merely
the brief extract that appeared in the Daily News. In answering
my questions, therefore, he is not influenced by any preconceived
motions or interpretations. In my letter I asked him the following
question :
" What do you consider the following would suggest to
any old Rochfordian ?
" '
G. D.' speaking says :
'
Remember Playle and 0—Over—Over—.'
Also, do you consider that the phrase '
Near the Malt ' gives an
adequate idea of the location of Gordon Davis's house at Roch-
ford ?
"
Mr. Histed's reply dated February 17, 1926, reads as follows
:
" '
0—over—over '
of course means Overell (either Cliff or Leonard).
" ' Near the Malt ' is a concise location of Gordon Davis' house
Avhen he lived here. If I have not answered definitely enough
please ask again. I have an open mind re your researches."
In the face of this evidence it is a mere quibble for Mr. Bradley
to maintain that the name of Gordon Davis' house was not given.
As a matter of fact, as I have pointed out in my paper, the
house was actually called " The Malting."
Mr. Bradley states :
" This voice of the purported spirit of
Davis Gordon or Gordon Davis did not volunteer one correct
name with the solitary exception of a vague reference to the
surname '
Playle,' of which name there are many people." He
forgets to mention that the name " Playle " was given in con-
junction with the syllable " Over— " repeated twice, which any
Rochfordian would recognise as an attempt to give the name
" Overell." Not only did Mr. Davis so recognise it, but Mr.
Histed does also. Mr. Bradley further ignores the fact that
" Playle " was actually a friend of the real Gordon Davis who has
recorded in his diary that he interviewed this friend " Playle
"
on January 6th, 1922, just two days after the first sitting. Mr.
Bradley also ignores the fact that the families " Playle " and
" Overell " were close friends.
March, 1926 A Reply to Mr. H. Dermis Bradley 43
I come now to examine a piece of criticism which, with its
superb negation of every law of human probability, is destined,
I believe, to become one of the classics of absurdity. I refer to
Mr. Bradley's " analysis " of Nada's description of the future
house. His method, so far as I have been able to discover any,
seems to consist in taking each detail of the description, holding
it up to ridicule and arguing that it would apply to " innumerable
small households." Thus he says :
" There are tens of thousands
of wives with a child, and ninety-nine out of hundred women
are fond of flowers." jSTo one will dispute this, and no one will
dispute that there are thousands of houses with a pair of brass
candlesticks in the basement, other thousands which have some-
thing answering to the description of a verandah in front of them,
and so on for most of the other details. But surely it is obvious
that what is important is the simultaneous coincidence of a large
number of items, each one of which is found to fit the living
Gordon Davis. Further, not one statement {excepting the account
of his death) given by either Gordon Davis or Nada tvas found to
be inapplicable to the real Gordon Davis.
Let us see what mathematics has to say on the question.
Taking an estimate that is ridiculously low we may safely assert
that not one person in .500 will have among his acquaintances
anyone of the name of Gordon Davis (or Davis Gordon). Not
one in 1,000 houses in Great Britian, on the average, would have
anything that could be even remotely described as "a funny
dark tunnel." The chance, therefore, of the simultaneous coinci-
dence of these two events is understated at 1/500,000. Not one
in a hundred houses in England will be fronted by anything that
resembles a verandah as much as the little seaside shelter that
stands in front of the Southend house. Not one in a 1,000 houses
will contain a piano with a bird of any description on it. The
denominator of the fraction that denotes the chance of coincidence
of these four simultaneous events is 500,000 x 100,000, or several
score times the total number of houses in Great Britain. And
we have still the candlesticks, the pictures, the saucers, the two
'
E's '
representing the name of the street, the fact that the house
is joined up to others, the " five or six steps and a half " ?'n front,
the wife and the little boy to take into consideration. There is,
further, the condition that the owner of the house must have
lived at a place whose first syllable is Eoch— and his house
44 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March, 1926
there must liave been near something called " The Malt." More-
over the sentence " Remember the old school ?
" clearly imposes
the further condition that the Gordon Davis mentioned must have
been a schoolfellow of the sitter.
We must now add to the other descriptions the following
incident related by the communicating Gordon Davis. " Remember
our last talk ? " i
'
'i-
S. Yes, I do quite well. Where was it ?
"
Voice. " In the train—about guards—not train guards though. A
little confab on the work of guards. That help you ?
"
S. " I can recall it excellently."
Mr. Bradley's treatment of this incident of the conversation
in the train affords another brilliant example of the startling
quality of his logic. He says :
" The reference made by the voice
'
to the short conversation in the train ' about a little confab,
on the work of Guards, conveys nothing whatever. Millions of
people were talking about the work of tlie Guards during the war."
The italics are mine. It will be noted that Mr. Bradley in both
these sentences spells '
guards ' with a capital '
G ' and that in
the second sentence 'guards' has become "the Guards." :
The conversation in the train had nothing to do with the work
of " The Guards," but was a discussion of the differences in the
ceremonial of mounting guard in the infantry as compared with
the artillery.
'
It will be seen that Mr. Bradley has tried deliberately to
obscure the whole issue. The value of the incident is to be found
in the very definite reference which Davis makes to his last
meeting with the sitter in the train, and in his being able to
recall the main topic of conversation which concerned the cere-
monial of mounting guard in the infantry as well as the artillery.
There had been nothing in the previous conversation to lead Mrs.
Cooper to guess that my last conversation with Davis was a
war-time conversation. It might, for all Mrs. Cooper knew, have
taken place in a hundred places other than in a train. We might
have talked of a thousand different things other than the duties
of mounting guard. The chance of coincidence between two such
entirely unconnected and definite events as the correct statement,
of the meeting place and the main topic of conversation must be
inconceivably small.
I must draw attention to some further examples of Mr. Bradley's:-
March, 1926 A Reply to Mr. H. Dennis Bradley 45
trick of quoting isolated phrases and entirely ignoring the context.
He says : "... and again :
He is showing me the letter '
E ' and some figures, but I
can't see what they are. Two E'.s"
Mr. Bradley does not mention that I proceeded to ask Nada
what the letter " E " meant, and received the reply, " Feel sure
that it has to do with the address of his wife."
In the next sitting I ask
:
Me. Soal. " Could you give me the name of the street ?
"
Nada. " Get the letter '
E's."
Mr. Bradley quotes this and comments on it as follows :
"It is on such a reply as this that Mr. Soal assumes the
address to be " Eastern Esplanade."
Again I must reply that I ?nake no such assumption. I am
merely recording a coincidence. I go on recording coincidences
until an overwhelming number of coincidences are obtained, until,
in fact, I am able to challenge Mr. Bradley to lay his hands on
another single house in Great Britain which, with its owner,
satisfies the descriptions given at the sittings.
With regard to the passage-way which leads to the back pre-
mises of Mr. Davis' house, the expression " funny dark tunnel
"
used by Nada impresses everyone who has actually seen it as an
excellent description. I do not think such " tunnels " are to be
found elsewhere in the whole of Southend. Moreover, the seaside
shelter which is precisely opposite the gateway of the house,
reminds one very forcibly of a verandah, and there is actually a
verandah round the roof of this structure.
Mr. Bradley says : "Mr Soal even omitted to ask the names
of '
the wife and the kiddie '
who were referred to. A most
obvious question which could easily have been verified."
This is another mis-statement by Mr. Bradley. On page 565
of my report, item 52, I ask concerning the wife, " Could you
describe her or give her name ?
" The name was not forthcoming.
Mr. Bradley says :
" Mr. Soal is still apparently confused in his
own mind as to what he really does think, for he commits two
of the most blatant contradictions I have ever read." He then
goes on to misquote me as saying : "It would be entirely illogical
to describe this case as one of '
communication ' by a living
person. All we are entitled to say is that a communication was
received concerning Gordon Davis." What I actually said was
:
46 Journal of ISociety for Psychical Research March, 1926
In discussing this remarkable case it would be perhaps entirely
illogical, although practically convenient, to describe the case as
one of '
communication '
by a living person. . . . We know that
his conscious mind was busy interviewing clients on both occasions
on which he was supposed to communicate. All that we are
entitled to say is that a communication was received concerning
Gordon Davis ; that is to say, certain facts were communicated
about his life-history, past and future." I fail absolutely to see
any " blatant contradiction " between the above statement and
the Avords " this dramatised personality which is so accurate in
its statements apparently believes itself to be a deceased person."
Is Mr. Bradley so ignorant of the technicalities of psychic research
as not to understand that a dramatised communicator is not
necessarily a real person, but may be, as in the case of James
Miles, a mere figment of the mind masquerading as a real person ?
I will now deal with the question of corroboration in so far as
it affects the case of Gordon Davis. In the case of John Ferguson,
I have already stated quite clearly in my paper that the case
depends essentially on my own honesty. The details given in
that case, which extended over ten weeks, are of an exceptionally
clear and vivid character, and unless my own honesty is disputed,
I do not think the case can be explained away. With regard to
this case of Ferguson it would be quite open for me to take an
entirely different standpoint. I might regard the case as one that
awaits confirmation by other observers. It is true that experi-
mental control has not yet been established in psychic research
as in the physical sciences, but this control may be forthcoming
any day. It might come, for instance, by the discovery of some
powerful drug which would facilitate and multiply the production
of all kinds of supernormal phenomena. The mere fact that a
certain piece of work awaits confirmation by other experimenters
is no argument against its being published—especially if it shows
a reasonable acquaintance with the technique of the subject and
is moreover a verbatim record.
Moreover, " corroboration " does not necessarily mean having
witnesses present at the sitting in a case like that of Gordon
Davis, where many of the facts given could not possibly have
been known to the sitter at the time of the sitting. I want to
emphasise what are the salient features of the Gordon Davis case.
One whole sitting is devoted to a description of a house, which
liiAECH, 1926 A Reply to Mr. H. Dennis Bradley 47
on January 9, 1921, the date of the sitting, was not occupied by
the real Gordon Da^ds. The house and its contents for all
practical purposes did not come into being as the residence of
the Davis family until December 13th, 1922, almost a year after
the time of the sittings. Now we have a witness, a science
graduate of St. Catherine's College, Cambridge, who testifies that
he read during the vacation of January, 1922, the description of
the future house from the same book from which the typed
copy was made that was handed to ]\Ir. Da^as in April, 1925.
It is not a question of how much my brother remembers of the
Gordon Da^ds case. The importance of his testimony consists in
the e\'idence it affords that the same record which was presented
to Mr. Davis in 1925 was already in existence in January, 1922.
Now I have already shown that the description of the future
house cannot be explained away as a chance coincidence. The
laws of probability rank themselves inexorably against such an
explanation. There remains, therefore, only the supposition of a
collusion between my brother and myself. On his visit to South-
end on September 19th, 1925, Mr. W. H. Salter of the Council
of the S.P.R. saw the house and its contents, and, excepting the
removal of two desert scenes which had been transferred to a
bedroom, Mr. Salter found no descrepancy in the descriptions
previously given by myself and Mr. Davis. Mr. Salter inspected
Mr. Davis' diaries, and states that Mr. Davis fully confirmed
Mr. Soal's statements as to their previous acquaintanceship, his
lack of interest in psychical matters, and the circumstances under
which he became interested in No. 54, Eastern Esplanade."
He also, I understand, formed a favourable impression of the
personality of Mr. Davis.
The fact that every detail given by Nada and Gordon Davis,
except the account of the latter's death, was actually verified, and
corresponds with reality, is in itself an argument in support of
the contention that my records at the sittings were exact. I would
point out further that the mere fact of having witnesses
present at the sitting (even if this had been practicable or useful
in my own case), would not have been even a reasonable guarantee
that the information given was definitely supernormal. If I had
wanted to produce spurious records, all that it would have been
necessary for me to do would be to interview Mrs. Cooper in
the intervals between the sittings and deliberately suggest various
48 Jotirnal of Society for Psychical Research Maech, 1926
names and incidents to her conscious mind. Alternatively I could
have had a series of sittings at which witnesses were present, and
have interpolated other sittings at which I deliberately suggested
such incidents or names. The memory of professional mediums is
notoriously short, and I feel quite confident that the " direct
voice" would have reproduced many of my suggestions, in the
presence of a room full of witnesses.
Mr. Bradley says that in the first sitting Gordon Davis uttered
twelve short sentences, which would take just fifty seconds to
enunciate. He does not mention that these twelve sentences are
broken by two considerable intervals of silence. In any case,
what have the fifty seconds to do with the matter ? Let him
remember that kings have been dethroned in fifty seconds. Let
me also assure him that listening to Mrs. Cooper's voices while
the musical-box is playing is simply a matter of practice and
nothing else. To say that it is difficult or impossible would be
as absurd as to contend that Sir Henry Wood cannot discern the
slightest mistake in the piccolo or the wood winds amid the
terrific din of the orchestra. I am not a Sir Henry Wood, but
I have trained myself, at least to some extent, in picking out
various instruments in an orchestra.
I have reason to believe that the trumpet was held quite close
to my ear while conversation was being carried on, and after a
time I found the efiort of listening to the voices far less dis-
tracting than say—trying to carry on a conversation in a railway
train. In cases where syllables were articulated in attempts to
give proper names I have, I believe, in most cases in my report
understated the number of times that a syllable was uttered.
I was most careful not to record anything unless I was certain
it was actually clearly given.
In connection with the case of John Ferguson, Mr. Bradley
makes the following statement. " The somewhat lengthy records
and notes made by Mr. Soal on this case seem to be quite
valueless.
"It is simply a case of impersonation or of a muddled spirit
endeavouring to communicate. Impersonations often take place
when the medium is not fully developed."
This judgment, given without analysis, without adequate dis-
cussion, without even any intelligent notice of the problems which
arise in the case, I am content to leave to the verdict of all
March, 1926 A Reply to Mr. H. Dennis Bradley 49
readers of the Proceedings and Journal. There is one statement,
however, which I must notice. Mr. Bradley says :
" During the
series of sittings Mr. Soal was constantly suggesting names and
places to the '
voices ' of both '
John Ferguson '
and '
Nada.'
This is a method which is never employed by an expert investi-
gator, and the attitude he maintained throughout was certainly
peculiarly brusque."
Now I have gone carefully through the " Ferguson " record,
and I find that during the whole ten sittings there are only three
occasions on which I ever suggested a proper name to " John
Ferguson " or " Nada " which had not been -previously given by
these communicators themselves. Two of these occasions are quite
unimportant. On page 528 of my report, after " John Ferguson
"
states that he was an engineer, and mentions " a room with big
machines," I ask the question, " Was this in London 1 " and he
replies :
" It might be London." On page 542 in order to see
how the communicator would re-act, I deliberately asked the
question :
" Were you ever at Gibraltar ?
" The only other
instance occurs on page 542, when in an attempt to elicit the
residence of " Shoeshine " I suggest the names Southend-on-Sea
and Portsmouth. This resulted in my obtaining the name Ply-
mouth or Plym— which turned out to be the name of the place
to which Captain Shoesmith had removed. The name was quite
unknown to me at the time of the sitting, and my questions
were, therefore, quite justified by the result. I want to point out
that all the other names I used in my conversation with " John
Ferguson " had been previously given by " Nada " or himself. Such
names were Brentford, Highland, Onget Road, Warecott Road,
Shoeshine, etc. I had a perfect right to use these names in
carrying on the conversation with " John Ferguson." My whole
object was to prevent him from wandering too far from his
previous statements.
Mr. Bradley speaks of my " telepathic or subconscious mind
theories." I want to point out that when I have used the term
" telepathy from the sitter " I use it not to denote a theory but
simply as a name to cover a certain peculiar class of observed
mental coincidences. Beyond a passing allusion to the time-space
theory, I have restricted my theoretical analysis to the limits of
what is required for an intelligent presentation of the facts.
Those who attempt to carry this interpretation farther than I
60 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March, 1926
have done, do so at their own risk. If Spiritists see in my facts
a menace, it is not because of any theories to be found in my
paper, but because my pellucid facts reveal to them, as in a
mirror, certain fundamental weaknesses in their own position.
In conclusion, I do not feel called upon to ofEer " an explanation
of the means by which the subsconscious mind can create an
audible and intelligent sound from space." In the case of Mrs.
Cooper I have no evidence even that the voices are produced
" from space "—whatever that may mean. S. Gr. Soal.

As interest in Psychical Research increases there arises a need for
introductions to the subject from the pens of reliable authorities.
Mr. Holms in his recently completed work on the facts of psychic
science has written a carefully documented survey of phenomena
believed by spiritualists to be of an occult nature. As a work of
reference to recorded instances of alleged supernormal phenomena
in English and American literature the work is certainly of
value, but its service to serious students of psychical research is
of a different kind. For it is a striking example of what the
study of occultism can do to the human mind. Mr. Holms
began with a healthy disbelief in the everyday occurrence of
supernormal phenomena. But study of mediumistic records and
the practical experience of the seance room have influenced his
mind to such an extent that for him the mysterious showmen of our
music halls are no longer clever performers but powerful mediums,
who, for purposes of expediency, disguise their gifts. We were
aware that this view has been held in other quarters, especially in
the early days of spiritualism, but we confess to a feeling of
mild surprise at finding it seriously advanced in a work of this
character. In order to understand this introduction to " psychic
science " the reader must always remember the attitude of its
March, 1926 Reviews 51
author. We cannot discover within its pages any criterion of
judgment. If Mr. Holms goes to a music hall, sees a conjurer
or performer whose methods he cannot understand, then that
person is a medium possessing psychic powers. If a Japanese
magician has his arms tied together and then receives solid hoops
upon his arms, then he must be " a singularly powerful medium,"
presenting " a good instance of the passage of matter through
matter " (p. 337). Obviously the same standard of criticism is
applied to the work of the medium proper. How, for example,
can one explain the masks, beards, muslin, and phosphoric oil
found in connexion with Williams and Rita in 1878 ? Mr. Holms
thinks it is very simple ;
they are either apports brought in by
malicious spirits, or the objects were introduced by the sitters to
discredit spiritualism (p. 388). From this it will be seen how the
phenomena of the seance room are treated by Mr. Holms, and
how the most painstaking historian that spiritualism has yet
produced has succeeded in his task. For, apart from the author's
mental attitude, the book contains a readable survey of the
history of spiritualistic inquiry, and in the accounts of the marvels
of the past, the reader will do well to remember that their
narrators in many cases had (for all we know) precisely the same
mental attitude as Mr. Holms. When that fact is thoroughly
grasped the student will realise how properly to appraise the
stories he hears which emanate from spiritualistic sources.
Dr. Tischner in his brief survey of the whole field has provided
German-speaking peoples with the most useful summary of psychical
research which has hitherto appeared. He has selected his examples
from a wide range of material, and even if certain of his specimens are
open to objection, it is as well for the student to realise that if no cases
were given except those the evidence for which was absolutely flawless
there would be few cases indeed left with which to deal. In his
criticism of the cases of clairvoyance he has wisely omitted the
name of Bert Reese, who has been included by Mr. Holms, but
on the other hand he seems to accept the reliability of Dr.
Crawford's observations, basing his belief apparently upon the
improbability of the observer being deceived for so long a period
of time. It is to be hoped that Dr. Tischner will study the
work of Mr. Holms, as there he will discover an easy solution to
his difficulty, and incidentally solve other doubts concerning the
probability or improbability of certain minds being open to the
52 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March, 1926
most barefaced deceptions without either suspecting or discovering
it, and at the same time preserving an outward demeanour of critical
acumen so wholly at variance with their mental outlook.

NOTES ON PEEIODICALS.
The Journal of the A.S.P.R. for January has a translation of the
article by Prof. F. Cazzamalli which was published in the Revue
Metapsychique in 1925 (pp. 215-233).
Mr. Price contributes a vivid account of some sittings at which
he was recently present with the medium Willy Schneider. The
seances took place in the flat of the medium's father, in Braunau
am Inn, and the circle included other members of the medium's
family. Both telekinetic and teleplastic phenomena were observed,
and in certain cases the alleged teleplastic structures were observed
supporting the various objects used at the sitting. The account
gives a good idea of the typical modern seance for physical
phenomena and illustrates the enormous difSculties which stand
in the way of any systematic experiments in this field.
Mr. Bird, in the same issue, has a judicial and crushing survey
of the Moss Case, which will be found to be of some service to
those who may wish to become acquainted with the methods of
modern British psychic photographers and their promoters. He
shows how the oft-repeated assurances of the impossibility of
fraud have no basis in fact and are merely part of a general
scheme of propaganda for the sake of publicity.
The Zeitschrift fiir Parapsychologie {Psychische Studien) for February
has a German translation of Prof. Cazzamalli's experiments men-
tioned above, and also a further account of the poltergeist pheno-
mena which are said to occur in the presence of the young girl,
E. Zugun in Hungary.^ From the account given the phenomena
do not appear to have been good, and sufficient evidence of their
supernormal character is not provided by the writers of the
article.

A FURTHEE DISCUSSION OF MR. SOAL'S REPORT ON
SITTINGS WITH MRS. COOPER.i
I. A Letter prom Dr. Hereward Carrinqton.
Mr. S. G. Soal's Report on his sittings with Mrs. Blanche Cooper,
published in the Proceedings (Part 96), is to my mind one of the
most illuminating so far issued by the Society. It throws an
interesting light upon the possible mechanism of such communica-
tions, and raises problems of a concrete nature which before had
remained mere vague " possibilities." Mr. Soal may certainly be
congratulated upon having obtained such valuable results. Un-
fortunately, my own sittings with Mrs. C'ooper were extremely
unsatisfactory,—no clear evidence of any supernormal faculty
having been obtained at any of them. But sitters may differ
as well as mediiuns, and the mere fact that my own sittings with
Mrs. Piper, years ago, were also typically " bad " sittings (relatively
speaking), does not in the least alter the fact that many other
individuals have had " good " ones. In psychical research each
case and each investigation must stand alone and upon its own
merits ; and Mr. Soal's results are certainly extraordinary. Several
points of interest are raised by his paper, it seems to me, well
worthy of special comment.
In the first j^lace, we have the " Gordon Davis case, in which
a series of " communications " were received from a man who

afterwards turns up alive and well. This instance is by no means
unique. One recalls at once the case given by Flournoy, in his
Esprits et Mediums,—the case of Mme. Dupond. Here, a soi-
disant " Rudolph " communicates, and sends messages to those
still living, stating that he had actually died at 11 o'clock that
morning. He also turned up alive and well !
^ Other instances of
a like nature could be quoted. Cases such as these bring home
to us very clearly that, no matter how spiritistic in setting and
appearance a certain set of communications may be, that fact
in itself constitutes no guarantee of their authenticity, but that
the genuineness of the communications must be judged solely
upon their supernormal content—as Hodgson and Hyslop both
acknowledged in their original Piper Reports.
The " John Ferguson " case, in which a number of communica-
tions were received from an apparently fictitious personality,
shows us to what an extent suggestion may act upon the mind
of the medium and influence the results. Even the best mediums
are capable of being similarly influenced ; once they get upon the
wrong trail, this will be followed for a long time before the error
is discovered by the sitter, the medium, or the trance personalities
themselves. Ready-to-hand instances of this are the Hall-Tanner
sittings {Studies in Spiritism), and the case of Dean Bridgman
Conner,—details of which are given by Mr. A. J. Philpott, in his
book upon the subject. William James was always insisting upon
this point : viz., that the mind of the entranced medium is
particularly susceptible to suggestion, and that " what you put
into the mind you are very likely to get out of it." But he
did not by any means think that this fact eliminated super-
normal information being given, or even genuine spiritistic messages.
He only contended that this should make us doubly cautious in
accepting them upon their face value. And I may point out, in
this connection, that this was also emphasised more than a
hundred years ago by some of the early " mesmerists." Deleuze,
e.g. in his Animal Magnetism, replying to those who wished to
question his subject upon points of practical advantage, said
:
" You will gain nothing ;
you will even lose the advantages
which you might have derived from his lucidity. It is very
possible that you could make him speak upon all the subjects
;JJ,^See my translation of this book, published in English under the title
Spiritism and Psychology, pp. 72-82.
Apeil, 1926 A Further Discussion of Mr. SoaVs Report 57
of your indiscreet curiosity ; but in that I have already
warned you, you will make him leave his own sphere and intro-
duce him into yours. He will no longer have any other resources
than yourself. He will utter very eloquent discourses, but they
will no more be dictated by the internal inspirations. They will
be the product of his recollections or of his imagination ;
perhaps
you will also rouse his vanity, and then all is lost ; he will not
re-enter the circle from which he has wandered. . . . The two states
cannot be confounded. . . These somnambulists are evidently
influenced by the persons who surround them,—by the circum-
stances in which they are placed."
A beautiful example of all this is to be found in Dr. van
Eeden's Report on his sittings with Mrs. Thompson, when he says
:
" ... Being now well on my guard, I could, exactly in this
most interesting few minutes, detect, as it were, where the failures
crept in. I could follow the process and perceive when the
genuine phenomena stopped and unconscious play-acting began.
In hardly perceptible gradations the medium takes upon herself
the role of the spirit, completes the information, gives the required
finish and fills in the gaps by emendation and arrangement. . .
"
All this fits very well into James' theory that there are, in
such communications, " dips down," so to say, in which genuine
supernormal information is imparted, and that these bits of
information are picked-up and elaborated by the medium's sub-
conscious mind, and dramatised and woven into a mental complex,
—^just as external stimuli are picked-up and woven into a dream-
narrative by the dream-mind.
Mr. Soal remarks (p. 549), that " it would even appear that a
purely fictitious communicator like John Ferguson can sometimes
give supernormal information about facts unknown to the sitter. ..."
An obvious example of this may be seen in the " Dr. Phinuit
"
of the early Piper regime. Another good example is " Harrison
Clarke," who purported to communicate through Mrs. Smead,
but who seemed to be just as hazy and fictitious a character as
Dr. Phinuit. (See Hyslop's Report : Proceedings of the American
S.P.R., Vol. 1.) Nevertheless, Harrison Clarke succeeded in
obtaining a good deal of information about various sitters, and
Dr. Hyslop told me confidentially that he was rather sorry that
he had " banished " him, as the quality of the information obtained
depreciated very perceptibly thereafter !
I
58 journal of Society for Psychical Research Aphtl, 1926
As to the "James Miles" case, assuming tlie lionesty of the
medium, the most obvious conclusion to be drawn, it seems to
me, is that Mrs. Cooper had unconsciously noted references to
this incident in the daily papers—just as '
Miss X.', in her oft-
quoted case, mentally recorded the obituary notice of a friend
of hers in the Times,—without knowing that she had done so,
—
and shortly afterwards saw this reproduced in the crystal ball.
{Essays in Psychical Research, pp. 113-14.) But it is true, as
Mr. Soal points out, that certain details were also given, which
turned out to be true, but which were not reported in the daily
papers—at least in London. These must be pigeon-holed for future
reference.
Mr. Soal is of the opinion that a " physical link " of some sort
between the sitter and the deceased person is often necessary
in order to insure the best results (p. 479). It is hardly necessary
to point out that Dr. Hodgson was also strongly of this opinion,
and presented articles to the medium, whenever possible, which
had been worn or had been for long in the possession of the
alleged communicator. He even issued special instructions to
prospective sitters, telling them to wrap-up such articles in oil-
silk, and allow no one else to touch or handle them in any way.
I myself still have two pencils which were used by Mrs. Piper,
when sitting for Dr. Hodgson, which are still wrapped in this
manner. I may say that I have tested a number of mediums
with these pencils, since then, in order to see if any special
"influence" were recognised. So far, however, these experiments
have been entirely negative in their results.
Three main conclusions, it seems to me, may be drawn from
Mr. Soal's Report : (1) Supernormal information, sometimes of
quite an extraordinary character, was obtained. (2) Communica-
tions having all the ear-marks of genuine spiritistic messages may
be received, which are certainly not spiritistic in character.
(3) We seem to have opened to our vision a vague and mysterious
realm, in which telepathy operates freely, quite unknown to the
persons involved; and, in the words of Mr. Soal, "the case for
spontaneous telepathy between medium and sitter is far stronger
than the average psychical researcher usually admits. Indeed, it
would seem to be so extensive that in the present state of our
knowledge we are not justified in putting any limits to it"
(p. 549). This is quite in keeping with Professor Richet's theory
April, 1926 A Further Discussion of Mr. SoaVs Report 59
of Cryptsesthesia, and, I may add, with the theory which I myself
advanced nearly twenty-five years ago, when writing of the Piper
phenomena. (See Proceedings, Vol. 17, pp. 337-59.) 1 then sug-
gested that subconscious telepathic interaction might be far more
extensive than is generally supjiosed. At all events, Mr. Soal's
Report seems to me to be full of fascinating problems, no less
than it is a valuable record of actual occurrences, and I for one
consider it a distinct contribution to the literature of psychical
research.
Reply by Mr. Soal.
I would like to offer one or two suggestions with regard to Mr.
Hereward Carrington's kind appreciation of my paper in Proceedings.
Mr. Carrington mentions the case of " Rudolph " given in Prof.
Flournoy's - book Esprits et Mediums. Now it seems to me that
this case differs essentially from my " Gordon Davis " case in one
important respect. If my memory is correct all that was given
by the soi-dtsaw^ " Rudolph
"
" might well have been the product of
Mme. Dupond's own imagination. No knowledge was shown that
was definitely supernormal as happened in the case of Gordon
Davis. A remarkable feature of the " Davis " sittings would
appear to be the strong resemblance which they bear to the
ordinary cases of " spirit communication from people who are
known to be deceased. Had " Davis " turned out to be really
dead the communications would, I believe, have been accepted by
many people as fairly good evidence for his continued survival.
In the case of " Rudolph " there does not appear to be any real
evidence of identity beyond what could have been derived from
the mind of Mme. Dupond who herself wrote the messages.
I quite agree with Mr. Carrington's interpretation of the case of
James Miles, but perhaps it is worth while pointing out that the
only two details that were definitely coAct and that were not
given in the London papers, were not fTO:;t;hjcoming at the sitting
until I had read them in the Bath papersr. It is possible, there-
fore, that my own mind may have been the, source of these two
items. The references to " insurance money " and a " gate near
the boy's home " are, I consider, too vague to be taken into
account.
II. A Letter from Miss H. A. Dallas.
February 2, 1926.
Will Mr. Soal kindly assist us in our study of his interesting
60 Journal of Society jor Psychical Research April, 1926
document, published in Proceedings, by telling us whether (1) he
had recently been thinking of " Gordon Davis before the sitting
with Mrs. Cooper, Jan. 4, 1922 ; and (2), whether the voice which
seemed " quite familiar " to him made him think of " Gordon
Davis " before he asked " Who are you ?
"
H. A. Dallas.
Reply by Mr. Soal.
February 6, 1926.
In reply to the points raised by Miss H. A. Dallas I had not
to the best of my knowledge been thinking of Gordon Davis
before the sitting. Had I thought of him even a few days previous
to the sitting on Jan. 4 I should have made a note of it at the
time, and the fact that I did not make any such note makes
it highly improbable that he had entered my mind before the
sitting.
I undoubtedly thought of him occasionally during the summer
and autumn of 1920 just after I had received the false news of
his death, and I have a distinct recollection that more than once
I felt extremely sorry for him.
In reply to Miss Dallas' other question I am certain I did not
actually think of Gordon Davis until he gave his name. I had
merely an impression that the voice was one that I ought to
know quite well. But when I heard the name there flashed
into my mind an overpowering recollection of the conversation in
the train. The peculiar intonation of the " voice "
vividly recalled
the rather affected accent that I had noticed in the train, and
which I had slightly resented at the time. The impression I had
of Mr. Davis when I met him as a cadet was that he had
cultivated a peculiar kind of intonation whereby all our natural
vowel sounds are slightly falsified—an accent that is very charac-
teristic of a certain class of army officer. I felt in fact that
Mr. Davis was trying rather to impress me and that he could
if he wished revert to a more homely type of speech. In this
opinion which I formed in 1916 I am confirmed by my subsequent
intercourse with Mr. Davis. There is I think no doubt that
Mr. Davis had assimilated a certain accent in accordance with the
particular type of men with whom he was associated at the time.
It was this accent more than anything else—together with some
indefinable resemblance in the actual voices—^that made me exclaim,
' By Jove and it's like Gordon Davis too !
"
April, 1926 A Further Discussion of Mr. Seal's Report 61
III. A Further Statement by Mr. Soal.
In order to guard against possibilities of overstatement I wish
to substitute for the estimates given on p. 43 of the Journal for
March (Vol. 23), in my reply to Mr. H. Dennis Bradley, the follow-
ing reduced figures. It will be seen that these revised estimates
make not the slightest material difference to my argument. The
corrected argument should read :
Calculations based on a study of several County directories
enable me to assert that not one person in 100 will have among
his acquaintances anyone of the name of Gordon Davis (or Davis
Gordon). Examination of a particular large town like Southend-
on-Sea makes it probable that on the average not one in 500
houses in Great Britain would have anything that could be even
remotely described as " a funny dark tunnel." The chance,
therefore, of the simultaneous coincidence of these two events is
understated at 1/50,000.
Again, I think I am quite safe in saying that not one in 50 houses
in Great Britain will be fronted by anything that resembles a
verandah as much as the little sea-side shelter that stands in front
of the Southend house.
It is not easy to estimate the chance that a given house should
contain a piano, with a bird of any description standing on it, but
I feel certain that this chance would be understated at one house
in every 20.
Hence the denominator of the fraction that denotes the chance
of coincidence of these four simultaneous events is, 50,000 x 1000 =
50 X 10^, i.e. several times the total number of inhabited houses in
Great Britain [taking this number as 8-5 x 10®].
CORRESPONDENCE.
Concerning Errors of Transmission in Trance-Communication.
To the Editor of The Journal or the S.P.R.
Madam,—Your correspondent, B. G. Bouwens {Journal, Jan. 1926),^
states one of the problems of trance communication. He says,
^ " Errors obviously due to mishearing of the English language
occur fairly frequently in communications. Since the transmission
of the message, at least at the source, is supposed to be inde-
iSee also S.P.E. Jour., Vol. XXII., pp. 94 and 12(j.
62 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 1926
pendent of spoken sound, how is this to be explained ?
" May
I offer some observations based upon a study of Mrs. Leonard's
sittings ?
According to their method of delivery the communications can
be classified thus :
(1) Those transmitted through the medium's lips by Feda, Mrs.
Leonard's control.
(2) Those spoken through the medium's lips by the communicator
when in direct control, and without assistance from Feda.
(3) Those given in the " direct voice," apparently that of my
communicator. These are rarely more than brief sentences, and
seem to originate at a spot somewhere in front of the medium's
face. I do not think I am mistaken in assuming that this is
actually the direct voice. It is not to be confused with " dupli-
cations " which may be described thus,—During Feda's controlling
I frequently get long passages given a few words at a time. First,
these few words are heard spoken by the medium's lips in a
clear whisper, and then they are repeated in the ordinary Feda
voice. The long messages given in this way are always most
carefully phrased and accurate in pronunciation, strikingly different
from the Feda talk. Feda meanwhile gives no token of being
aware that I hear these whispers, but always most carefully
repeats them to me. I think these whispers result from Feda
mentally repeating to herself the words she " hears," before she
designedly transmits them to me.
Class (1) has three sub-divisions,
—
(a) Messages in which Feda gives verbatim the words of the
communicator. During reception of these she pauses to " listen,"
and repeats only a few words at a time. This is easily the best
method ;
proper names sometimes come through with accuracy,
at other times they may be correct as to the first portion of a
name. There is every indication that Feda, meanwhile, is in the
position of a person listening to spoken words.
(&) Messages received when Feda cannot " hear " what the
communicator is " saying," or cannot hear with ease and accuracy.
Feda then falls back upon a diiferent method, that of " sensing
"
the communicator's thought and expressing it in her own words.
(c) Ideas expressed in picture form. Feda will say that the
communicator is " showing her," or that he is " building up for
Feda to see," and then follows the description of a scene, picture,
April, 1926 Correspondence 63
or symbol. Sometimes there is an appeal for this pictoria
method, as when she says, " Feda cannot get that. Show it to
Feda."
The difference in phraseology between the messages (a) and (h)
is most striking. With the former I get the perfectly worded
sentences so characteristic of my communicator in his earth-life.
Often they appear to be rather beyond Feda's comprehension.
While Feda is thus " hearing " clearly there is never any obscurity
in the contents of the messages. When, on the contrary, she is
" sensing," there are frequent omissions in the chain of thought,
and the form of expression is sometimes rather vague. Feda
admits that, while sensing, she usually leaves out portions of what
is given her to transmit, although doing her best to get through
as much as possible. Feda's own forms of expression, and the
English in which they are given, contain many inaccuracies.
I think we must regard these sub-divisions (a), (6), (c), as
indicating variations in the form taken by the communicator's
thought when it emerges in Feda's consciousness. His thoughts,
reaching her from an external source, emerge as sound, as aware-
ness, or as sight. When the conditions are at their best she seems
to herself to be actually hearing; but when conditions deteriorate
she is aware only of a general impression of what is in the com-
municator's mind ; while at other times his ideas are received in
the form of pictures which she more or less clearly visualises.
Feda asserts that she cannot easily concentrate on two reception
methods at once; if she wishes to hear, it is necessary to ignore
seeing and sensing meanwhile. To some extent she is able to
decide which method to use ; her will plays some part.
But whichever method is used " the transmission of the message,"
as your correspondent says, " is supposed to be independent of
spoken sound." I think it is undoubtedly independent. When
Feda speaks of hearing she is describing how the message appears
to her consciousness at the moment of its reception. I have reason
to think that she is aware that whether she hears, feels or sees,
the origin in each case is actually a thought, and thought only.
The above outline requires, for its completion, illustrations of
the different classes of message, together with explanations of the
modus operandi as given by communicators, and by Feda, in reply
to the sitter's questions. But this would expand my letter into
an article of serious length.
64 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, I92e
It would, however, be misleading to leave the above sketch
as it stands ; for there is one all-important factor which has not
been mentioned. The understanding of this factor would go far
to explain why it is that the ideal method of quoting the com-
municator word for word is not employed throughout the sitting.
I refer to that elusive something which Feda terms " the power."
It is, we are told, when " the power is failing " that the sitting
comes to an abrupt end. When Feda says, " there is plenty of
power," the best results are obtained.
What is this " power " ? Illustrations of its apparent influence
upon clarity of expression, the ability to transmit names, and
upon the memory of the control, would call for extended treat-
ment. It would also be necessary to quote the communicator's
spontaneous remarks about the relation of the power to good
conditions, and his replies to my questions about the nature of
the power itself.
I am studying this elusive factor. If there exists any record
of experiment or discussion bearing upon it, I should be glad of
information ; for up to the present I have failed to discover
anything beyond mere references to " the light," or " the power,"
scattered here and there in records of sittings. My provisional
conclusions may be summarised as follows :
Mediums provide an invisible, intangible emanation which is the
indispensable prerequisite for psychical phenomena of any kind
whatsoever. In mental mediumship this emanation is in a highly
attenuated condition, and it surrounds medium and control,
sitter and communicator. It would seem that this emanation
uniquely affects both the control and the medium's brain, rendering
them highly sensitive to thought. It is said to be attracted
towards centres of mental activity. During a sitting, therefore, it
should be chiefly collected around the medium and around the
communicator ; but if the sitter permits his thought to become
too intense he unwittingly draws around himself so much of this
emanation that it forms a third centre, and confusion in trans-
mission inevitably results.
During a control sitting this emanation is in continual but
irregular motion, like wind on gusty days. The receptivity of
the control, therefore, varies accordingly. In consequence of this
flow and ebb, a degree of accuracy in reception is possible during
one period of a sitting which becomes impossible at another period.
My communicator breaks off from a subject when he becomes
aware that Feda is in difficulties with its transmission, and he
endeavours to revert to it later, should conditions improve.
This has a bearing upon the difficulty with names ; I have noticed
occasionally that names which failed to be given at a first attempt
were put through quite easily a few minutes later.

CASE.
G. 292. Apparition of a Cat.
We print below a case in which a house would appear to have
been haunted by the apparition of a cat. It is important to
note that the three percipients concerned saw the " ghost-cat
"
independently, that is to say, none of them had any conscious
knowledge at the time of the experience that the house was
supposed to be haunted, or that any other inmate had seen
this cat.
The names and addresses of the persons concerned are known
to the Society, but pseudonyms are used here. The case was
sent to us originally by Mr. A. W. Trethewy, a Member of
the Society, to whom Mr. and Mrs. Simpson (pseudonym) are
known personally, and who has himself stayed in the house in
question.
On June 16, 1925, Mr. Trethewy wrote to the Secretary,
Miss Newton, as follows
Here are some papers about a house haunted by a cat, which
may deserve a place among your records. I have made an en-
quiry myself and trust that my notes cover every point of imjoor-
tance on which the letters did not give full information.
A. W. Trethewy.
With this letter Mr. Trethewy enclosed the following note :
—
... I stopped at W for one night this month with the
[Sini'psons'] and my marginal notes on the attached papers are
based on the enquiries which I then made. I have no doubt
that they gave me correct information to the best of their ability.
They seem to be intelligent and accurate observers. I accept their
statements as true. I did not see the ghost cat myself. Mr.
and Mrs. {Simpson] were both clairvoyant in the past, she used
the crystal and he had the gift of travelling clairvoyance "
;
neither of them uses the power now, they gave up the practice
years ago owing to unfortunate experiences. Miss [Allen] (pseu-
donym) probably has psychic powers too ...
A. W. Trethewy.
Mat, 1926 Case 67
Mr. Simpsons original statement concerning the cat ran as
follows :
—
20th Feb. 1925.
With reference to the ghost cat we have seen in this house
—
neither my wife nor I have ever heard anyone say that this house
is supposed to be haunted. The house was built, I should think,
at the end of the MOO, or early 1500. Fifteen years ago—it was an
inn, before that a farm house. " The Bogie Cat " has been seen
several times by my wife and myself, also by our friend Miss
[Allen^ when she was staying with us—but it has never been seen
by any two of us at the same time. We all agree it is a long-
haired cat, practically black. Miss [Allen] has seen it both in
the house and garden—my wife and I saw it only in the house.
Each of us have seen it in several different places. My wife and
I have never seen it walking towards us—only by our sides—
•
across or away, never coming to meet us. When I have seen it,
it always has its tail up on end, anyway, by the time I have
decided I am looking at "Bogie," not at one of our own two
cats—which are smaller and lighter in colour. I never used to
believe in ghosts and always said when they were mentioned,
" Show me something which will stand up to a shot gun, and I
will believe I've seen a ghost."
The first time I saw Bogie, I was in the dining-room and
thought I saw a cat trying to get into our dresser cupboard (our
cats will get into it, if the doors are left open). It was some
nine feet from me—I walked over to it and bent down to push
the cat away—I then noticed I could see right through it. The
cat was going away, so I thought I would follow it and I did so,
through the dining room door, which was open, across a little
lobby, then through the scullery into the pantry. In the middle
of the pantry floor it vanished. I immediately went into the
kitchen and saw our two cats asleep on a chair. The doors were
all open. I should like to say that at a few feet away it looked
like any common cat, but when I was close to it, I knew it
would be useless to try to touch it as I could see right through
it. Both my wife and I saw it several times before we mentioned
it to each other. We never mentioned " Bogie " to Miss [Allen]
till she said, "I see a cat about your place, which vanishes—it
cannot belong to you."
The last time I saw Bogie " was about a month ago—I went
A -2
68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mat, 192(}
to the front door to get the letters by evening post and said to
the postman, " Bother, I've let the cat out." He remarked, " No
cat came out, Sir." I took the letters to my wife and said, " I
have just seen Bogie again." C. J. [SIMPSON\
With this statement Mr. Trethewy enclosed the following
letter from Mr. Simjjson, to which he appended the marginal
notes referred to above. These notes are printed at the end
of Mr. Simpson's letter.
8th May, 1925.
In your letter of March 10, you asked me to answer the follow-
ing questions about the ghost cat seen in, and about this house.
Before receiving your letter I had not made any notes on the
subject. Here are your questions :
(1) Approximate date ?
We came to this house March 1, 1924 ; from then till March 10,
1925, my wife and I saw the cat, each several different times.
Note in my diary April 4, 1925, at 8.48 p.m. " Elsie (my wife)
when coming out of the bedroom saw the ghost cat at the top of
the stairs sitting still, it passed her (Note 1, see below), and went
on down the stairs.
(2) Time of day ?
I have seen Miss [Allen] since I received your letter, and she
told me she had seen it in the garden in daylight.
(3) Have dogs and cats seen the ghost ?
We have a bull terrier and two cats, but I have never noticed
anything in their behaviour to make me think they have seen the
ghost cat (Note 2, below).
(4) Has your servant seen it ?
No (Note 3, below).
(5) Has anybody seen it besides you, your wife and Miss [Allen]?
No, we have had other jDeople stopjDing with us who have said
they wished they could see it, but they have not done so.
(6) Has it been seen by one person but not by another who was
present who woidd have seen it if it had been a live cat ?
Yes, I went to the front door after dark to take the letters
from the postman, saw the cat pass me and run out to the gate,
some 24 feet ; I remarked to the postman, " I have let the cat
out," he answered, " No cat came out. Sir." I went to my wife,
gave her the letters immediately, and found both our cats asleep
in front of the fire in the room with her (Note 4, below).
Mat, 1926 Case 69
(7) Remarks as to the circumstances of apparition a^id any other
point worthy of mention.
My idea is that other people, when in this house, may have
seen Bogie, but not known it was a ghost, simply on what I have
noted, this : That at, say, 9 feet or more it looks an ordinary
cat, but when quite close to it you see through it. Miss [Allen]
said, when she saw it, she knew she was not looking at an ordin-
ary cat, because it vanished (Note 5, below).
Miss [Allen] was here during the summer of 1924. She told us
she once felt it under her feet, looked down, but could not see
anything (Note 6, below).
Once since then, when I was coming down stairs in the dusk,
I thought that when I was at the top stair, there was a cat some
stairs down ; I walked on down the stairs, saw no cat, where I
had seen one, but I felt my foot kick against something that
moved, when I got to the stair where I had seen it, when I was
on the landing (Note 7, below).
When Miss [Allen] said she must have felt Bogie, I laughed at
her. Because my idea was that Bogie was as it were a mirage,
seen but not to be felt, because it was without dimension ! Some
time after, I myself thought I felt it, may be, because I thought
I saw a cat on a certain stair, on getting to that stair, I thought
I felt it ! "When my foot got to that stair, I looked down at
the stair but could see no cat ! At the time I was certain
neither of our cats were anywhere near the stairs.
Notes by Mr. Trethewy.
(1) Sideways, not facing her.
(2) No dog or cat has been present, when the ghost cat has
appeared, but a bull terrier has once or twice apj)eared frightened
at night, looking at something invisible.
(3) She has never mentioned it, but has not been questioned.
(4) It was 5.30 on a winter's evening, so, if it had been a real
cat, it might have escaped the postman's notice.
(5) Mr. Simpson has never seen it in broad daylight, but his
wife and Miss A. have done so.
(6) She may have fancied this feeling, but it may have been an
objective sensation. I did not see her, and can only judge from
the Simpsons account of what she said.
'70 Journal of Society for Psychical Research mat, 1926
(7) He was not feeling with liis foot for it, but had put his foot
forward confidently, as he thought the cat had gone.
(8) All the people who have seen it describe it similarly as
iarser and darker than the house cats and with tail erect. No-
body has ever seen it coming towards him or her. Its eyes have
never been seen because its face has never been turned towards
the spectator.
The [Simi^sons] are trying to sell the house, because it does not
suit them, not on account of the ghost cat, so they have not
talked to the villagers about the apparition for fear that the house
may be considered to be haunted and, therefore, may become
difficult to sell.
The ghost cat is not like any cat which they have ever owned
and there is no story to connect it with the house ;
their prede-
cessors in the occupation of the house never mentioned it to them.
So far as they know nobody knows anything about it except
themselves and the friends whom they have told. It has never
been seen in the bedrooms or drawing-room ; when seen, it gener-
ally walks towards the scullery or pantry. There is no object
apparent in its manifestations ; it seems to be quite happy.
A. W. T.
Mr. Trethewy also sent us the following letter addressed to
him by Mrs. Simpson
:
—
May 21th, 1925.
I was most interested to hear of your friend's ghost kittea.
The cat we see here is not like any cat my husband or I have
ever had. I have seen it again in daylight in the kitchen since
you were here, and I feel sure its interest is in the house and not
Elsie [SIMPSON].
The following account of her experiences was also obtained
from Miss Allen :
—
While staying at the above address [address not given here]
last May I saw the jDhantom cat twice.
My friends Mr. and Mrs. [Simpson] had told me nothing about
it, so I was not in the least expecting to see anyt.hing of the sort.
I saw it twice in one day, first soon after breakfast while in
the garden near the backdoor, close to some gooseberry bushes.
I reaUsed that it was not one of my friends' cats, the colouring
Mat, 1926 Case 71
was different. I did not see it very distinctly—it was going
away from me—and I somehow felt there was something funny
about it. Shortly afterwards I was in the larder, the door of
which was open, leading into the back kitchen, again I saw the
same dark-coloured cat, walking past the open door, its tail erect
as before. Again I realised that there was something queer about
it, and seeing Mrs. [Simpson] I said to her, " I don't know what
is the matter with me this morning, but I am seeing cats !
"
I then explained, and she informed me that I had seen the
phantom cat. [ALLE'N}.
To this letter Mrs. Simpson has appended the following
note :
—
Keceived from Miss [Alleyi] June 24, 1925. Miss {Alleii] was
here May, 1924, not, as she says. May, 1925. C. [SIMPSON].
Another case in which the apparition of a cat was seen was
printed in the Journal, Vol. XV. p. 249-254. In that case the
hallucination was collective and the cat was recognised as one
which had formerly lived in the house.
THE CASES OF MR. MOSS AND MR. IVIUNNINGS.
The two following cases are here discussed, not only to provide
Members of the Society with information which they ought to
possess, but also to illustrate how easy it is at the present
time for fraudulent mediums to find material for the purposes
of their trade.
The Society first received information concerning Mr. George
Moss in May, 1924. He appears to have been a chauffeur
in a northern town, and professed to obtain " extras " upon
photographic plates which he could not explain. His employer
began to make inquiries, was easily convinced, and the fame
of the new medium began to spread. In April, 1925, he left
his employment and was placed on the regular staff of the
British College of Psychic Science, Ltd. The following note
appeared in Light on '4th April, 1925. "Mr. George H. Moss
is now on the regular staff of the College, for psychic photo-
graphy. His work, which has been closely watched, and
experimented with for the past year, is '^excellent, and the
72 Journal of Society for Psychical Research ^niat, 1926
College has every confidence in recommending it to those
interested in, or requiring, the comfort of this particular psychic
manifestation."
A further note appeared on 16th May of the same year,
praising Mr. Moss and the remarkable clearness of some of
the " extras," and remarking that " the variety and curious
conformations of the surrounding ectoplasm " made his work
a very valuable addition to that of the other mediums.
A fuller account of the medium's activities were published
in the Transactions of the College for April, 1925. Mrs.
M'Kenzie discussed the evidential results, and showed exam23les
of the recognitions attained by sitters, apparently unknown to
the medium. In the same issue the Principal of the College
published a long and carefully recorded series of experiments
with Moss, illustrating the effect of mediumistic energy upon
the sensitive emulsion of photographic plates. These experi-
ments (which had no scientific value) were made because Moss
had found it necessary to have the plates used at the sittings
in his possession for some time previously. The reason alleged
for this proceeding was that it was found that the plates had
to be " magnetised," and Mr. M'Kenzie's experiments showed
that the plates which had been in the medium's possession
behaved differently on development from what normal un-
treated plates were expected to do.
In Jime, 1925, Mr. Moss went to Birmingham, and there an
unfortunate incident occurred. Mr. Fred Barlow (late Hon.
Secretary of the Society for the Study of Supernormal Pictures)
was examining some of the plates used at the sittings which
bore " extras," when he noticed that all these had one edge
roughened whilst the negatives bearing no " psychic " marldngs
were all smooth. This excited his suspicions, and subsequent
examination showed similar markings (hitherto unnoticed) on all
the College plates which bore extras. Mr. Moss had certainly
been very careless, and his method was clear. The " magneti-
zation " was merely an excuse for ojDening the packets of
plates and impressing the fraudulent " extras," the correct
positions of which were assured by fiUng one edge of the
plate, so that in inserting it in the slide the spirit should not
be found standing on its head.
May, 1926 The Gases of Mr. Moss and Mr. Munnings 73
Moss was cliallenged on these points, but signed a paper
denying that he opened the packets. When confronted with
iurther evidence, he confessed to the wholesale imposition, and
was dismissed from his employment.
The second case, which furnishes us with a curious history
of mediumistic activity, is that of the trumpet medium,
Frederick Tansley Munnings. This person first seems to have
attracted public notice in 1919, when a letter appeared in
Light (7th June, 1919, p. 181) describing a seance with
Munnings in London, at wliich the trumpet was plainly seen
floating in the centre of the circle, and at which a full-form
materialised figure shook hands with some of the sitters.
'This letter aroused protests from certain persons who had been
present at Munnings' sittings, and who believed the phenomena
"were entirely fraudulent. No definite action seems, however, to
have been taken, and in 1921 Mr. Munnings, now " Mr.
Gaulton," gave sittings at the Stead Bureau apparently under
the auspices of the Guild of Spiritual Unity. Spirits purporting
to be Sir WilUam Crookes, BiUie Carleton, and Dan Leno
kindly commim.icated, and the result seems to have perturbed
the members of the Guild, since some " test " sittings were
proposed to Mr. Munnings, alias Gaulton.
These seances took place, and the results did not satisfy the
Committee of the Guild, Avhose verdict aroused a lively con-
troversy. Glowing accounts were published as to the marvels
to be observed at Munnings' sittings, and other evidence was
offered pointing to the normal explanation of these remarkable
phenomena. Rubber gloves had been foimd secreted on
Munnings' person, and the " spirit scents " apparently proceeded
from a rag which was accidently dropped by the medium, and
was subsequently found by the sitters after the performance.
The President of the Hastings and St. Leonard's Christian
Spirituahsts' Society then published " two photographs of Mr.
Munnings, etc., taken during a test seance ^ by the kind
permission of his guide " (Light, 1921, p. 384). These photo-
graphs showed " ectoplasm " proceeding from Mimnings, and in
one case a " plasmic rod " is supporting the trumpet.
^ There were no test conditions of any kind at this sitting. (See Light,
1921, p. 401.)
74 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May, 1925-
The result of these inquiries was to discredit Muimings, and
although the sj^iritualistic press still maintained that he had
" the gift," yet the quality of his mediumship was such that
" right-minded spiritualists were warned against him " {Light,
1921, p. 417). In 1922, however, he was stiU giving seances
until apparently he found more lucrative employment, which
ended disastrously before the Surrey Quarter Sessions on 2nd
January, 1923, when he was sentenced to nine months with,
hard labour for burglary on 25th October and 28th November,
1922. Very soon after Munnings came out of prison, he went
back to spiritualism. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, discussing
Munnings with the journahst Mr. Moseley {John Bull), who was
to have sittings, wrote that " these things are on a low plane,
but I believe the man is a very strong physical mediixm." ^
Mr. Moseley was not impressed by the performance, and
wrote an unfavourable account of his impressions. This
publicity, however, was building up a fresh clientele for
Munnings, and on 28th June, 1924, Light appeared with the
headline on the cover, " Broadcasting Spirit Voices." This
experiment was devised by Mr. R. H. Saunders, who wished
to " broadcast the direct voices of spirits, in bright light."
" Sir William Crookes " and " Sir William Preece " volunteered
their hearty co-operation {Light, 1924, p. 403), and about
250 persons were present on 24th July, 1924, for the demon-
stration. The name of the medium had apparently been
suppressed until the end of the meeting, and then some must
have been surprised to find it was Munnings, " one of the
strongest voice mediums we have," according to Mr. Saunders.
This advertisement brought many clients to Mr. Munnings, and
we find Mr. Dennis Bradley devoting Chapter XIV. of The
Wisdom of the Gods to the same medium. His conclusion was
that " F. T. Munnings is a very powerful voice medium
"
(p. 141), although " there was an absolute scarcity of actual
evidence and of personal identity "
(p. 140).
In March, 1926, Mr. Munnings was still giving sittings.
But unluckily for him, owing to a burnt-out fuse, which con-
fused a sitter as to whether a switch was on or off, the light
went up in the middle of a seance and revealed Mr. Munnings
1 S. Moseley, The llysterious Medium, London (1924), p. 81.
Mat, 1926 Notes on Periodicals 75
with an extension device for the trumpet and an angle piece
to his mouth. This proved too much, and Dr. Wallace, Sir
A. C. Doyle, Mr. Bradley and Mr. Saunders wrote a joint
letter to Light (13th March, 1926, p. 125) warning the public,
although they stated that they knew " of cases where the
psychic result has been beyond suspicion."
NOTES ON PERIODICALS.
The Revue Metapsychique for January-February has a long appeal
from the Committee relative to the projects and aims la the
research work of the Institute in Paris. Prof. Richet contributes
an article on the alleged cryptesthesia of the subject Schermann,
as related in the book by Prof. Fischer of Prague in 1924.^
Prof. Richet thinks that the cryptesthesia of Schermann is esta-
blished in an irreproachable manner, and in the same number of
the Revue M. Sudre reviews Prof. Fischer's book in some detail.
Dr. Osty, in the same issue, has a lengthy and interesting accoimt
of M. Pascal Forthuny's [Georges Cochet] public seances for
clairvoyant descriptions, which can be compared with those which
have become so familiar with English mediums.
The Journal of the A.S.P.R. for February has a further dis-
cussion of the alleged supernormal faculties of M. Forthuny from
the pen of M. Rene Sudre, and Mr. Bird has a note upon the
Cazzamalli experiments, giving the opinion of Alexandro Tosi that
the results are valueless. In his criticism of Tosi Mr. Bird neatly
sums up the controversy, but we can hardly assent to his judg-
ment that unless independent experiments give negative results
\ Cazzamalli's results must be tentatively accepted.
In the same issue Mr. Price narrates a story of a poltergeist
which was apparently at work nearly thirty years ago, and also
' an account of a case dealing with what is termed " Pseudo-psychic
manifestations due to self-induced hysteria." The case is of little
importance to psychical researchers, and the attitude of the
subject herself renders any successful treatment difficidt to initiatei
The issue of the same Journal for March has an article by
M. Sudre on the Role of Prosopopoiesis ^ in Psychical Research, in
Experimente mit Raphael Schermann. .. . (Berlin u. Wien, 1924.) Cf.
Dr. W. Prince's note on this subject in the Jo!;?-«aZ ,- A.S.P.R., 1924, xviii
pp. 537-561.

76 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May, 1926
wiiicli lie emphasises the points raised in his recently published
Introduction a la Metapsychique Humaine, which compel him to
state that " the analysis of messages from the dead prevents
absolutely our believing their alleged origin."
Mr. Price, in the same number, contributes a characteristic
account of a sitting with the slate-writing medium, Mrs. Laura A.
Pruden, of Cincinnati. The record is valuable, as it illustrates
forcibly the chaotic condition of certain branches of psychical
researcli, and the ease with which any person claiming super-
normal powers may attract attention, and reap much material
benefit as w^ell. The writer tells us that Mrs. Pruden was induced
to come to England to exhibit her powers to "a few of the
leading psychists " in the " Old Country," amongst Avhom he
mentions Sir A. C. Doyle, Mr. Hewat M'Kenzie and Mr. Swaffer.
This medium appears to i^ossess so great a contempt for her
sitters that she expects them to submit to conditions, which, if
Mr. Price had not described them, we would have believed im-
possible. She sits alo7ie and uncontrolled at one end of a table,
the legs of which are swathed with cloth material down to the
floor excejjt on her side. She sits back to the light, and her
arms, legs and feet are entirely invisible to the sitters. She holds
the slates under the table, presumably with both hands (Mr.
Price does not tell us), and the " phenomenon " consists of
messages on the slates and " answers " to questions written by
the sitters on billets placed under the table. Mr. Price concludes
that " it would be unfair to pass an opinion as to the abnormality
or otherwise of the phenomena " that were produced.^
The same issue contains an interesting survey of the early days
of the Schneider mediumship by Commander Kogelnik of Braunau
am Inn, who has been in touch with the family for some years.
In his observations on Kogelnik'sj article, Mr. J. M. Bird tries to
^ The psychological effects of this medium and her performances upon her sitters
seems to be peculiar. For in the sitting described above the " phenomena "
either were due to the most arrant fraud or were supernormal. To describe
messages produced without the aid of human hands as " abnormally
"
produced is an expression difficult to understand. Similarly, her exhibitions
in America aroused great astonishment. Sir A. C. Doyle described her as
certainly one of the great mediums of the world (Our Second American
Adventure, p. 44) ; and Mr. Bird declared that if she is a fraud, then there
is absolutely no sense in believing an3rthing creditable about any member of
the human race (J. M. Bird, My Psychic Adventures, London, 1924, p. 280).
Mat, 1926 Notes on Periodicals 77
link up the incipient stages of the Schneider mediumship with
those in other mediumships, and finds points of parallelism with
them. In particular he discusses certain aspects of the Margery
mediumship, but he appears to forget that similarity in pheno-
mena is by no means evidence for their supernormal character,
and often rather the reverse. Similarly the importance that he
attaches to " clairvoyant descriptions " during sittings for physical
phenomena appears inexplicable, unless we assume that he pos-
sesses good evidence that such descriptions are, in one sense at
least, ' veridical," and have been checked by control experiments.
The Zeitschrift fur Parapsychologie for March has a concluding
portion of the translation of Prof. Cazzamalli's experiments, and
also an article by Prof. Blacher of Riga on an evidential case of
apport-s. From the account of the phenomena provided by the
author the case aj^pears far from evidential, and it is remarkable
how writers on supernormal phenomena neglect essential details in
their descriptive narratives, which make their contributions worth-
less from the scientific point of view.
In the same issue are published further notes by Buchner and
Kroner on the Moll trial, and in addition an open letter by the
latter to the Director of Police, Berlin, on the value of para-
psychological phenomena in criminal investigations.
The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology for January has
"the report of the Committee which was formed to award §5000
to any person producing physical phenomena under the conditions
prescribed by the Committee. These conditions, which seemed to
imply detailed knowleclge on the part of the Committee of the
laws underlying supernormal phenomena, proved unaccejstable, and
from the report it would appear that neither the award nor the
Committee offering it were considered seriously by any responsible
person, replies being mostly received from psychopathic individuals,
and in two cases from actual lunatics.
The first number of the new Journal issued in connection with
the recently-formed British Institute of Philosophical Studies is
entitled the Journal of Philosophical Studies, and comprises a
number of papers by various writers. The aim of the Journal is
to provide material of interest to students of philosophy, while at
the same time to avoid a preponderance of articles intelligible
only to the expert. It hopes to foster the growth of a more
"widely diffused philosophical temper ; to publish articles which
78 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mat, 1926--
may stimulate the begimier to study more original sources ; and
to survey foreign philosophical literature, both in book and
periodical form.
The Morning Post has recently published ^ a series of articles
upon " Spiritualism and the Church," in which a correspondent of
the newspaper has collaborated with Dr. Percy Dearmer in dis-
cussing the influence of the spiritualistic movement on orthodox
religion. The basis of the discussion is the undoubted fact that
large numbers of people are forsaking the churches and following
the teachings of spiritualism, and that therefore there must be
some good grounds for this new movement in relation to the
religious needs of our time. Some attempt is made, therefore, to
describe Spiritualism and Spiritualists, and to throw some light
upon their methods and arguments. Dr. Dearmer's treatment of
the subject is highly sympathetic, and in his examination of the
movement his charity leads him to omit the other side of the
picture. But although perhaps he is not fully alive to the darker
and more secret history of spiritualistic activity, he is fully con-
scious of the need of the scientific method, and in his discussion
of the necessity of evidence he contributes a glowing appreciation
of the difficult work of the S.P.E.
The Society, he says, " stands purely for the belief in the value
of experimental science. It is disliked by many spiritualists
(though not, I should imagine, by the wisest), because of its
extremely critical methods, for it has often investigated some
alleged phenomenon and issued a report with a negative con-
clusion." Proceeding, Dr. Dearmer discusses the meaning of
proof, and continues :
" It was an early work of the S.P.R. to
establish canons of evidence of a strictness never known before.
Every possibility of human error has to be eliminated ; and the
mere ixnsupported evidence of one person that he saw a thing is
regarded as of no importance whatever. Collective evidence is of
more value ; and it was by such collective evidence, duly signed,
and supported by the evidence of contingent events, that one of
the earliest investigations was made—that which produced the
first report on " Phantasms of the Living."

REVIEW.
Introduction a la Metaphysique. By Kene Sudre. Paris, Payot,
1926. Pp. M7.
Three-fourths of this book consist of a rapid, but clear, well-
written and well-arranged survey of the whole field of psychical
xesearch, which is open only to the criticism that M. Sudre does
not sufficiently warn his readers that a large portion of what he
accepts as fact has actually been disputed, and does not seem to
mind building elaborate theories on somewhat doubtful foundations.
The fourth part is a resolute attempt to deal with the philosophic
problems raised by a wholesale acceptance of everything super-
normal that has been alleged, and to construct out of it something
like a general theory of facts ; and it is clearly to this part of
his work that M. Sudre attaches most importance. Here he is
always ingenious and stimulating, whether he carries conviction or
not.
The spiritist interpretation of this phenomena he opposes, put-
ting his objections forcibly, and sometimes exaggerating. It is,
for example, too much to say that the spiritistic form which the
phenomena take is merely a result of training (p. 340) : it seems
to occur quite spontaneously, and should not be merely put
aside. Again, too much should not be made of the incompleteness
and triviality of the " spirit " messages while our methods of
communication are so rudimentary and defective : for on any
hypothesis the obstacles must be enormous, and have only been
very partially overcome. Philosophically the problem is that of
intercommunication between two psychologically diverse universes
or modes of being, and this would naturally involve abnormality
both in the communicator and the medium, and possibly also in
the sitter. With such conditions, the wonder is that an}i;hing
that can be recognised as evidential ever gets through at all
;
yet the evidence of spirit-identity, though far from adequate, is
at all events good enough and abundant enough to render imper-
sonation by the medium's unconscious mind (or by devils !) a
somewhat violent hypothesis. No doubt there is impersonation,
but it is not infrequently suggestive of an effort to ;,elect (often
"very cleverly) from the contents of the medium's and the sitter's
minds material that will convey the impression of a third intel-
ligence ; and this selection is not accounted for by tracing the
80 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mat, 1925.
material to its sources. It is possible that the difficulty o£
getting through material not in a living mind is so great that
such impersonation by selection may be the best a " spirit " can
do ; and if it thereby conveys a true impression of its personality,
it should not be accused of fraud. Lastly, M. Sudre should not
argue that because the spiritist interpretation is not the only one,
is not " cogent," and does not appeal to all, it is false. For
logically the evidence may not at present warrant decision iix
favour of anything. Also all the theories that have been sug-
gested so far may be partly true and partly false, and, quite-
probably, the " psychical phenomena " now grouped together may
turn out to be so complex and heterogeneous that no single-
explanation will cover them all.
Nor is it difficult to show that M. Sudre's own theory that
living minds possess " metapsychic " powers enabling them to
communicate telepathically, to produce telekinetic and teleplastic
effects, and to tap the memories of the dead, involves serious
difficulties. He has to explain the phantoms seen by the dying
as teleplastic fabrications by the latter (p. 357). He derives the-
supernormal knowledge of sensitives and clairvoyants from the
minds not only of the living, but also of the dead (p. 373) :
yet he will not admit that these surviving memories attest the
survival of the departed ;
they do not form living personalities,
but are merely exploited and moulded into impersonations of the-
defunct (pp. 375, 394-). Surely unowned memories, which survive
the mind that harboured them, and can be (unconsciously) picked
up by living minds, are new to psychological science, and would
endow every mind with potential omniscience. But not, according
to M. Sudre, with immortality. For in spite of its tele]3athy»
telergy and teleplasty, the soul is tied to the fortunes of the
body, as a mere dependency ; it cannot transcend the biological
sphere. But with such supernormal endowments it would seem more
plausible to conceive it as creating both its body and its material'
world, in idealistic fashion. Lastly, with a boldness that does
credit to his logic, he is willing to accept the occurrence of
successful predictions as positive proof of the illusoriness of time
and freedom and of the reality of an " eternal present." This
deduction seems to him (p. 384) to demand merely the sacrifice-
of a metaphysical theory of M. Bergson's : he hardly realizes that
with our immediate experience of the lapse of time would have
Mat, 1926 Correspondence 81
to go our consciousness of change and novelty, and a charac-
teristic and all-pervasive feature in our whole reality. Surely before
we concede all this to the alleged facts of prophecy, we should
have to scrutinize our " facts," and to render them far more
unequivocal and plentiful. It would have to be shown that these
prophecies were not of the nature of intelligent anticipations, or
warnings, or of the sort that bring about their own fulfilment.
Lastly, even if they could not all be explained away, they would
only conduct us to the conclusion that our experience was radically
contradictory, because, of course, they would not abolish our
experiences of change, freedom and novelty.
Nevertheless, there is plenty of room in psychical research both,
for the spiritist and for M. Sudre. What is needed at present
is a good supply of working hypotheses wherewith to explore
very anomalous region of phenomena, and, perhaps even more,
an unremitting endeavour to render both the observation and the
recording of the " facts " as complete and trustworthy as is
possible.

COERESPONDENCE.
I.
To the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.
264 Lexington Ave.,
New York, February 11, 1926.
Madam,—I have been most interested in the account by P. E.
Leaning, Journal for December, 1925, of further hypnagogic pheno-
mena. In particular, the report. No. VI, from Professor New-
bold, I find very suggestive, and possibly of greater import than
might at first appear. No one imagines Professor Newbold to be
deceived by his imagination, accustomed as he is to strict observa-
tion and analysis. It is therefore, most suggestive that he, in
catching gHmpses of what he took to be the convolutions of his
own brain and the giant star-shaped cells of the nervous system,
saw them aglow with light. The moment he became interested con-
sciously, it is to be recalled, and excited by his experience,
" instantly all disappeared."
On reading the account, at once there flashed into my mind the
familiar fact that even private psychics, who know nothing of the
82 Jotirnal of Society for Psychical Research. May, 192(5
technical terminology of our subject, have frequently had reference
to themselves as lights or as embodying some sort of sjDecial light-
I find, in my own investigations, that each psychic has a tendency
to turn to one side when " listening " for messages, and in the
cases of Mrs. Chenoweth [Soule], Mrs. Sanders [" Salter "], Mrs-
Chamberlaine, and Mrs. Osborne-Leonard, the impressions seem to
aj)proach from the right side, if one may judge by the turn of
the head and the attention toward that direction. It occurs to
me that the psychic " light " may be some such light as Professor
Newbold's vision caught, and it may affect one lobe of the brain
more than the other. As the psychics I mention are right-handed,
their psychic work may thus be addressed, so to speak, to the
less used half of the brain. It is quite in keeping that the light
disajjpeared when the consciousness became aware of it, for these
l^sychics work best when the consciousness is at a minimum, so
far as their ordinary senses are concerned.
Will anyone who is acquainted with one or more left-handed
psychics observe and rej^ort on the question as to whether such
psychics appear to gather their clairvoyant and general clair-
sensory experiences from their attention toward the right or the
left side of the body ?
I have seen in one case with a right-handed private psychic,
Mrs. Sanders, most interesting sujjernormal light effects on the photo-
graj)hic film, in a private experiment for psychic j^hotography, and these
effects were massed to the right of the psychic and slightly above
the level of the cranium. The illumination, that is to say, whether
from or toward the psychic's cranium, was on the same side as
the right lobe of the brain. Such matters are, if not jDhysical
phenomena, at least physical concomitants of mediumship and need
our attention and observations. Gertrude 0. Tubby.
P.S.—Just after I had written you on the 11th, I ran across
Dr. Hodgson's summary of points about " light " from his Piper
records, in Proc. XXIII. Part LVIII, p. 147. I am sorry not
to have referred to it in my comment.

To the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.
14.2.26.
Madam,—As a genealogist I wonder that information under that
lead has never (to my knowledge) been used as a proof of identity.
May, 1926 Supplementary Library Catalogue 83
For instance, I am interested in a certain John Jones—a man
eminent in a minor way about a century ago. Nowhere can I get
a hint of where he came from by which I can try to trace his
parentage. Yet the information probably exists and given a lead
could be verified. Now, if John Jones would tell us where he was
born, his parents' Christian names and his wife's surname, and these
were proved correct it would be an exceptional case of identifica-
tion since it can hardly be alleged that all the parish registers
and will registries could be clairvoyantly examined by any incarnate
subliminal mind.

PRIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES.
The 86th Private Meeting for Members and Associates wa»
held in the Rooms of the Society, 31 Tavistock Square, W.C,
on Wednesday, June 2nd, 1926, at 8.30 p.m.. Sir Lawrence
Jones, Bart., in the chair.
Mr. G. W. Lambert read a paper on " The Psychology of
Plotinus and its Interest to the Student of Psychical Research,"
June, 1926 Private Meeting for Members and Associates 87
which will, it is hoped, be published later in the Proceedings.
An interesting discussion followed, in which Professor E. R.
Dodds, Sir OUver Lodge, Mr. G. R. S. Mead, and others
took part.
SIXTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF PHILOSOPHY.
We have received from Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, who is a
Corresponding Member of the Society, an invitation "to parti-
cipate in the Sixth International Congress of Philosophy to be
held in the United States of America, at Harvard University,
Cambridge, Massachusetts, September 1.3th to 17th, 1926."'
A Programme of the Congress, giving details as to Member-
ship, arrangements for hospitahty, etc., can be seen at the
Society's Rooms.
A REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE.
The experiments devised by Miss I. Jephson and alluded to in
the Annual Report of the Council for 1925 {Jou rnal, Feb. 1926.
p. 19) appear to offer a prospect of obtaining some useful data
regarding alleged supernormal processes.
In order to extend these observations Members and Asso-
ciates of the Society are asked to co-operate in obtaining the
required data, the value of which will largely depend upon the
quantity submitted. The experiments can be done at home
and will take but a short time, requiring for their execution
neither skill nor previous knowledge of the subject.
Will those Members and Associates who wish to assist
notify the Research Oflficer in the first instance, who wdll
thereupon forward the necessary instructions ?
CORRESPONDENCE.
I. CoNCERNiNa "A Series of Sittings with Mr.
George Valiantine." ^
To the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.
Madam,—I should Hke to comment upon one or two statements
made by Una, Lady Troubridge, in her Report upon Valiantine's
i

88 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June, 1926
alleged trumpet phenomena. It will be remembered that the
investigation conducted by the Scientific American Committee was
entirely unfavourable to the claims of this medium, and the
conclusion arrived at was that fraud would account for all the
phenomena we then witnessed. I was a member of that Com-
mittee, and I wish to state that we have seen no good reason
to change our opinions since then—notwithstanding Mr. Bradley's
vitriolic attack, in his Towards the Stars. In our estimation,
fraud was clearly proved on those occasions ; and the general
tone of Mr. Bradley's writing—hysterical and high-strung as it
is—does not serve to inspire confidence in his readers, or to
justify any change of opinion on our part. Lady Troubridge,
however, is evidently a cool-headed and careful investigator, and
what she says must be given due weight. It is unfortunate,
therefore, that on the only occasion when she thought she heard
the medium's voice at the saiiie time as the " independent
"
voice, other sitters in the circle failed to do so, and that when
they thought they heard the same thing, she failed to remark it !
In view of the mass of negative evidence accumulated, I think
the simplest explanation of this isolated instance is—-either that
Lady Troubridge was mistaken in her observation, or that she
mistook the voice of some other niember of the circle for that of
Valiantine's, on this occasion. Lady Troubridge does not seem to
realise the fact that it is the easiest thing in the world for a
fraudulent medium to produce a '
voice '
at a considerable distance
from his seat, and to speak from it the next instant. When the
medium is speaking through the trumpet, the voice issues from
the other end of the trumpet, and, if he is leaning forward at the
time, the voice is (correctly) located, in the dark, at least four
or five feet from his chair. Then, if he merely removes his mouth
from the horn, turns his head sideways—at the same moment
sitting upright again—his natural voice is heard to speak from his
chair, i.e. four or five feet from the " independent " voice—and
practically instaneously—or a second later. If the trumpet be
directed towards the ceiling, the " independent " voice will seem
to be there ; if to the right or left of the circle, it will be heard
there, and so on. But the medium can immediately speak from his
own chair at any time—since the origin of the voice is there.
Bearing these facts in mind, and taking into consideration the
very dubious nature of the evidence obtained by the S.P.R.
Juke, 1926 Correspondence 89
investigators ; and remembering, also, the extremelv negative
results of our o^vn sittings—in which fraud was clearly proved—
I
think that any fair-minded critic may conclude that Valiantine's
phenomena are easily explicable, and that fraud alone wiU serve
to account for all the alleged manifestations produced through his
" mediumship."
Hereward Carrixgtox.
Note.—As to the trumpet-sitting given in the light : the
medium obviously sat with his back to the window to make
direct and prolonged observation of his face more difficult. The
faintest sounds are caught up and magnified by a trumpet, held
in the position indicated. I myself can carry on a prolonged,
whispered conversation, with my lips tightly closed, which can be
heard very clearly in the trumpet, when held in this position ;
and all the trumpet mediums I have ever seen, who gave " day-
light seances, clearly employed this method. I can see no
reason to think that Valiantine did otherwise.
H. C.
Eeply by Lady Troubridge.
I agree with almost everything that Mr. Carrington says. It
all comes down to the fact, which has been obvious from the
first, that under the conditions imposed by J\lr. Bradley—total
darkness, no control of the medium and a general atmosphere
of antagonism to any " tests " being required—it becomes quite
impossible for any serious investigator to do useful work or to
form an opinion worth recording of the physical aspects of the
phenomena.
As regards the psychic aspects much the same applies, since
Mr. Bradley introduces his sitters by name ; in many cases there
are preliminary dinner-parties at which the medium is introduced
to all the company and is able, should he wish it, to glean such
information as Mr. Bradley and his household may have failed
to supply. I am not for a moment suggesting that Mr. Bradlev
would intentionally prime the medium, but merely that the latter"
s
position as a guest in a household including Mr. and Mrs. Bradley,
their son and servants, and a younger son of eight years old,
offers unlimited opportunities for the acquisition of useful data
anent prospective sitters—especially where the hosts are convinced
spiritists, who would scam discretion !
90 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June, 1926
In making our record of the dark seances M. R. H. and I
were careful merely to state, as far as possible, actual happenings
as they struck us ;
pronouncement as to their mode of production
was out of the question. For instance, I recorded that on one
occasion I heard a " trumpet voice " speak at the same tiiiie as
the medium. I also duly recorded that on that occasion no one
corroborated my impression, and left the reader the option of
interpreting the happening to his taste !
The same obtains aU through the record. Mr. Carrington,
however, is wrong in suggesting that I mistook another voice for
Valiantine's ; that I did not do so I am quite certain ; Valiantine
was too near me, and his voice and accent too individual for
such error to be possible. Again, he is wrong in thinking that I
do not realise that by leaning forward and speaking through the
trumpet a medium can produce a voice at a considerable distance.
That is undeniable, but I still think that in some instances the
distance at which the voice spoke would exceed that to be
obtained in the way Mr. Carrington suggests, unless the medium
was in possession of some extension-tube or attachment connecting
him with the trumpet.
All this, however, is and must remain pure hypothesis, since
none of us is in a position to know whether the medium was or
was not stuffed with paraphernalia !
As regards the mental or psychic content of the utterances we
are exactly in the same position. Nothing was given at our
S.P.R. sittings that could not easily have been ascertained by
the medium making a few enquiries, while we have no proof that
he did so. The definite mistakes made, however, such as Mrs.
Eastman (pseudonym) expressing affection for me, Alfred Herwood
(pseudonym) claiming acquaintance with M. R. H., our being still
at Sterling Street, are more suggestive of a medium's natural
lapses and mistakes than of a succession of errors on the part of
communicators, and the " Valiantine " Feda, with her Yankee
accent and vocabulary, her terrible blunder re Miss Walker, and
her calling me " Lady Troubridge," is so utterly unlike the
genuine " Feda " in every respect that no one who used an ounce
of judgment could find any connexion between the two.
Re the daylight sittings, Mr. Carrington's explanations of why
the medium sat with his back to the light, and regarding the
reason for the reversed position of the trumpet, are naturally
June, 1926 Correspondence 91
"those which occurred to us. There remains only the question as
to conversation with the lips " tightly closed." Mr. Carrington
says he can achieve this, and in that case there is no need to
seek a supernormal explanation, but I am bound in honesty to
say that neither Miss Radclyfie-Hall nor I can do it, in spite of
repeated efforts ; the lips do show movement at some consonants.
But on the other hand we have no practice in such forms of
camouflage, and if this is the method employed by Valiantine,
it may safely be assumed that he has worked to perfect it.
To sum up : the obvious and flagrant inaccuracies contained in
the utterances, which put them entirely " out of court as
genuine psychic communications, justify the deepest suspicion
regarding the means employed in their production, but the fact
remains that, thanks to the restrictions on investigation imposed
by Mr. Bradley, we are none of us in a position to go beyond
.supposition.

II. Concerning the Discussion on Mr. Soal's Report.
To the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.
Madam,—In connexion with Mr. Seal's Report on his sittings
-with Mrs. Cooper and the discussion on it in the April issue of
the Journal (Vol. XXIII, p. 55 ff.), I should like to suggest that
it is unscientific to assume that John Ferguson and Dr. Phinuit
.are fictitious personalities, because they have never been identified.
It is quite as unjustifiable an assumption as it would be to assert
definitely that they are not fictitious personalities.
About three years ago the first name of an airman was given
to me with detailed description and various particulars at a
sitting with Mrs. Osborn Leonard. I might have (erroneously)
considered this as referring to a fictitious personality, as I could
recognise none of the statements made ;
my only clue was the
name of the city of Manchester, which I remembered was the
post-mark of a letter recently received from a stranger. With
this clue I was able to trace the airman, of whose existence I had
no previous knowledge. This experience has convinced me that
we have no right to conclude that because we cannot identify a
-description it is fair to regard it as fictitious.
There is another point on which I would like to comment.
92 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June, 192e-
Mr. Soal says that had Davis turned out to be really dead the-
communication would have been regarded as ''fairly good evidence"
for his continued survival. Some of the contents of the com-
munication seem to have been derived telepathically from the-
sitter, but several incidents were unknown to him, so the source-
can only be traced to the living personality of Gordon Davis..
These particulars therefore afford " fairly good " evidence of
the survival of Gordon Davis ;
they indicate that in some way
(at present unexplained), Gordon Davis, alive in the flesh, was the
source of the part of the communication which dealt with matters,
unknown to Mr. Soal.
Whether Davis was in the body or out of the body, the evi-
dence justified the conclusion that he survived. What it does not
justify—and would not justify if he had died—is the conclusion:
that he was intentionally and consciously communicating ; in this-
connexion the case is valuable. It is not unique in character,,
but it affords a useful reminder that mediumistic communications'
which give correct particulars about a deceased person do not;
necessarily imply that this person is consciously the source ; whether-
that is so or not can only be discovered by the character of the;
communication.
H. A. Dallas.
[Note.—With regard to Dr. Phinuit it must be borne in mind',
that he did at various times volunteer statements about himself
and his life on earth, which—so far as they were verifiable
—
appear to have been untrue. For some account of the matter,,
see Dr. Hodgson's " Observations of Certain Phenomena of Trance,""

NOTES ON PERIODICALS.
The Zeitschrift fiir Parapsychologie for April has a discussion by-
Baron von Schrenck-Notzing of the series of sittings with Willy-
Schneider that were undertaken by the Society in the winter of
1924. He compares the results with those obtained elsewhere, but
complains that the report in certain places omits details essential,
to a proper understanding of the conditions. It appears that.
Baron von Schrenck has confused the gauze fence described on
p. 5 of the Report (Proc. S.P.R., Pt. 97) with the gauze cage-
June, 1926 Notes on Periodicals 9?-
described on p. 8. Thus when he surmises that at 10.26 p.m.
on Dec. 2, 1924, the tambourine must have executed a high
curve before falling on to the ottoman, it would seem that he
fails to gTasp the fact that at this sitting the fence was em-
ployed and that this, being a three-sided structure, offered no
impediment to the fall of the tambourine directly from the table
on to the ottoman.
In the same issue Mr. R. Lambert, of Stuttgart, has a useful
summary of Mr. Soal's paper recently published in the Proceedings,
and there are a number of smaller articles, including a brief
account of the position of occultism in Greece by Dr. A. Tanagra
of Athens ; a short paper on Occultism, Science and Religion, by
Dr Seitz ; and an account of a case of dissociation in a child of 13,
J
which has some interest as throwing light upon certain psycho-
logical aspects of adolescence.
The Zeitschrift fur Parafsychologie for May has an interesting
discussion, by Dr. Klee, of the twisting, matting and knotting of
horses' tails and manes as reported in various countries, some-
times in connexion with poltergeist cases. These phenomena both
with horses and other animals have been noticed from at least
the thirteenth century, the knots being usually attributed tO'
spirits or to
\
" that very Mab
that plats the manes of horses in the night
"
{Romeo and Juliet, i. 4).^
Dr. Klee examines the evidence and sums up the conclusions
that can be drawn from it. He hopes that owners of horses
will make careful investigations when manes and tails are found
knotted, in the hope that a satisfactory solution may be found.
The Zeitschrift fur kritischen Okkultismus (Bd. 1, Heft 3) has
an admirable and critical paper by Dr. Moll of Berlin upon the
" Clairvoyant " Ludwig Kahn and his investigators. Dr. Moll
comes to the conclusion that this medium produces his effects
through normal means, and he points out how evidence of this
can be seen in the reports of the Parisian investigators themselvea
(see Revue Metapsychique, 1925, 65-79, 132-143). He reveals the
fact (which has been known for some time by the Society) that

•94 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June, 1926
Ludwig Kahn is none other than the " Professor Akyldar or
Akldar " whose sandwich-men were parading Eegent St., London,
in 1920. It has been remarked by students of Kahn's phenomena
that there is a decided resemblance between them and those
produced by the American medium, Bert Reese. The normal
character of Reese's phenomena is upheld by critical and informed
persons who have had experience of them, and thus it seems
natural to regard with grave suspicion the phenomena produced
by the medium Kahn, and to regret the ready acceptance of his
claims by the Parisian enquirers. Dr. Moll supplies a startling sup-
plement to these conjectures in revealing the fact that Kahn him-
self was actually associated with Reese (or Rees as he puts it) in
Memphis (U.S.A.) about 1888. This fact, coupled with the additional
statement that Kahn was acquainted with Reese's claims as a
thought-reader, seems to supply some good evidence for the
supposition that Kahn's methods are those of Reese, and that
therefore the modus operandi is, in some respects at least, identical.
Dr. Moll, in his criticism of the case, shows that he is not
fully conversant with Reese's methods, although his remarks
exhibit a singular acuteness in the appreciation of detail. Thus
he fully realises that when Kahn insists on touching one of the
billets, there is an exchange possible, and he points out how the
method of holding the billets facilitates the manoeuvres. Similarly
he ridicules the idea that Kahn uses several billets to make his
work harder, and points out how this employment of several
billets serves the purposes of trickery, whereas by using one only,
substitution might be more difficult. In conclusion, Dr. Moll
complains Avith some justice that the records are without scientific
value, and closes on the note that the case is a good illustration
of the oft-repeated errors of investigators of occult phenomena.^

The same issue of the Zeitschrift has a paper by Albert Hofniann
on Volitional Energy which may be found to be of interest to
those who have followed the rather melancholy history of the
search for human " radiations," and also a curious account of
the levitation of a fakir, submitted to and here printed by Count
Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. The evidence is somewhat weakened
by certain facts fully discussed by the Count, but we are rather
surprised at the Count's statement that in the whole literature
of psychical research he can find no unquestionable {unzweidentig)
example of true levitation. In one sense this is, perhaps, true,
but there would seem to be modern instances which are far
better supported evidentially than travellers' tales of fakir levita-
tion.^
In the same number Count Klinckowstroem has some interesting
notes on " telepathic " cases as seen in the earlier literature and
also a note on the imitation moulds of hands recently made by
Sir Arthur Keith, but without appreciating the differences between
these and those produced by the medium Kluski.
The issues of L'Opinion for March 27 and April 3 have articles
by Paul Heuze on thought-transference with special reference to
the travelling telepathists " of the Donato-Pickman type. He
intends to publish the substance of a series of conversations he
has had with these showmen concerning their relations with
scientific men. Thus Pickman is said to have told him how he
deceived Professor Richet, and as to Lombroso, he declared : "In
the whole course of my career I have never seen such a sucker

In the issues for April 10, 17, 24, M. Paul Heuze continues his
observations on thought-transmission and deals mainly with codes
of various kinds. He considers that all telepathic performances-
on the stage are due to normal methods, and he even extends this
hypothesis of wholesale imposition to the work of the ordinary
physical mediums.
The organ of the recently formed " National Laboratory of
Psychical Research," which occupies the top floor of the new
premises of the London Spiritualist Alliance, is entitled the British
Journal of Psychical Research, and the first number is dated May-
June, 1926. Mr. Price has reprinted part of some of his recent-
contributions to the American S.P.R.'s Journal and also contri-
butes " A plea for accuracy " in which he describes a recent,
case of what he claims as misrepresentation on the part of a
prominent contributor to the spiritualist press. In discussing the
reason for the founding of the " National Laboratory " he says,,
" In Great Britain, prior to the founding of the National Labora-
tory of Psychical Research, there existed no laboratory devoted.
solely to psychic experiments," a statement which is in accordance
with the assertion in the preliminary announcement (ii^/ii, April 11,.
1925) that " there is no permanent body of psychical research
workers in this country (like there is in Paris at the Institut
Metapsychique), and the Laboratory will strike a new note iiL
this connection."
Apart from these somewhat surprising remarks, it appears from
the prospectus that the organisation has been formed mainly for
the study of the physical phenomena, and arrangements are being
made whereby " a supply of the best-evidenced types of medium-
ship shall be available for investigation."
The Revue Metapsychique for March-April has an obituary-
notice of Delanne by M. Andry-Bourgeois and a continuation by
Dr. Osty of his account of the alleged clairvoyant faculties of
M. Forthuny. M. Clement-Martin has an interesting note on the
history of the various pieces of apparatus which in the past have
been designed to illustrate the effects of supposed human radia-
tions, and Dr. Menager has a second note on the fallacies under-
lying the arguments of many of those who claim to show
the reality of these radiations by means of the photographic
plate.
The Journal of the American S.P.R. for April has a paper on
June, 1926 Notes on Periodicals 97
the ideas of Prof. Driesch by M. Eene Sudre and also a further
contribution to the subject of the slate-witing medium, Mrs.
Pruden, by Mr. Hereward Carrington. Mr. Bird sums up the
various observations that have been made and notes the fact
that "
no sitter is ever tolerated in a quarter of the room whence
he could see what the medium is doing beneath the table level
"
(pp. 219-220).
Psyche for April has a succinct discussion of modern psycho-
logical theories relating to the Body-Mind controversy by Mr.
C. K. Ogden, and a refreshing paper on the Role of Myth in Life
by Dr. Malinowsky, whose field-work in the Trobriand Islands has
brought him into close contact with actual native life and its
folk-lore.
Professor Rignano, in the same issue, has a stimulating paper
.reviewing his theories concerning the finalistic aspects of life.
He insists on the fundamental importance of teleology and shows
how the arguments of the mechanists fail to explain organic
processes. At the same time he admits the unsatisfactory
•character of the opposing theories and advances two new hypo-
theses which exhibit, it is claimed, none of the weaknesses of
•existing theories whilst still admissible from the strictly scientific
point of view. These hypotheses assume a reciprocally univocal
correspondence between specificity of substance, alternately accumu-
lating and disintegrating, and specificity of energetical activity,
•alternately charging and discharging. The disintegrating process
Is also assumed to be in some way transformed into the corre-
sponding synthesizing mechanism.^
The [Boston, Mass.] Banner of Life for May 8th has an inter-
esting account of a sitting for wax-moulds obtained with " Mar-
gery." These phenomena have not been very successful hitherto,
and the former occasion when one was produced in May 1924
led to an acrimonious discussion. In the present instance two
moulds were found in the pail of paraffin. One proved to be
an open man's hand,"" the report states, " almost perfectly formed,
the delicate rose-coloured paraffin resembling the human skin, the
fingers and thumb carefully finished. The other mould was of

two clasped hands, one almost perfect, the other much less
finished, and not fully formed."
The Journal of the American S.P.R. has a paper by M. Sudre
upon various forms of precognition and their meaning when
viewed in the light of relativity. Mr. Price contributes an
account of some sittings with Frau Silbert in G-raz, a medium
whom he considers " well worth the attention of any scientific
worker." Prof. Cxruber continues the discussion of the physical
phenomena with a paper on the problem of materialization in
which he stresses the importance of the Schneider mediumship in
a consideration of the subject.
The Bulletin des sciences pharmacologiques for April 1926 has a
French translation of the report on the plant Yage which was
published by Prof. B. Villaba in the Boletin de la Sociedad Golom-
hiana de Ciencias Naturales of Bogota in March 1925. Prof.
Villaba discusses in detail the effects of the plant, and denies
that supernormal mental phenomena are produced through its use.
This, he says, is " loin de la verite. Nous pouvons affirmer le
contraire d'apres les experiences que nous avons faites avec les
sels purs de I'alcaloide "

Carhon monoxid or Carbon monoxid Plus ? By Walter F. Prince.
{Bulletin No. II. of the Boston Society for Psychic Research.)
Boston. [1926.]
This booklet is an examination of an interesting case of alleged
haunting, in which the percipients were exposed to chronic poison-
ing by carbon monoxid, a process which is known to be pro-
ductive of hallucinations. The point to which Dr. Prince wishes
to draw attention is the question whether this poisoning can be
believed to be responsible for all the phenomena observed in the
house. There are certain points in the narrative which seem to
discount this hypothesis, of which the chief appears to be the
occurrence of the same hallucination to different witnesses at the
same time. From the records printed by Dr. Prince it does not
seem clear what is the precise chronological sequence of the
various documents, and this will permit the supporter of the
June, 1926 Reviews 99'
poison theory to suppose tliat this alleged spichxonism of percep-
tions was due to faulty memories in compiling the records.
G-enerally speaking, the analysis of the case provided by Dr.
Prince inclines one to the provisional opinion that the hypothesis
of '
carbon monoxid plus '
is the more probable ;
although it must
be left to each individual reader to decide what constitutes the
factor denoted by the term '
plus.'

By Richard Baeewald. Pp. 406. Berlin : Deutsche Buch-
Gemeinschaft (1926).
This volume, by the Editor of the new Zeitschrift fur kritischen
Okkultismus, is a thoughtful and serious contribution to the dis-
cussion of spiritualism. The author is a writer of philosophic
temperament, and is not led astray by the emotional quality of
the material with which he is dealing. He regards psychical
phenomena from the standpoint of the psychologist and the
anthropologist rather than from the religious propagandist or
utilitarian.
f As regards the phenomena proper, Dr. Baerwald accepts the
fact of telepathy, but he appears occasionally to forget that it is
but a name for a process and not in any true sense an explana-
tion of that process. It may be true, as Dr. Baerwald urges,,
that the gTeat bulk of the mental phenomena are due to telepathy
ivMr vivos, but an extension of a hypothesis founded upon a
process concerning the mechanism of which we know nothing, can.
scarcely be considered a satisfactory method of explanation. Such
a course is doubtless legitimate if its origin is clearly envisaged,
as also are other methods based upon different premises.
In his treatment of telepathy and alleged communications from
the dead, the author has drawn upon a mass of carefully selected
material, but in his treatment of the important and neglected
case of Staudenmaier (pp. 50-52) it is a pity that he did not
include the almost parallel experiences of " Mr. Griinbaum " for
the benefit of Continental readers.
In his treatment of the physical phenomena Dr. Baerwald shows
himself a member of the critical German school, whose numbers
are happily increasing as the years go on. He analyses witli
100 Journal of Society for Psychical Research jun-e, 1926
acute penetration the general system of occult theory and practice,
and in his selection of Thomas Mann's famous account of a seance, he
illustrates the preposterous conditions of modern investioations.
Although there are decided difEerences of opinion regarding his
i;heory of the unknown possibilities of the conjurer's art, it must
be admitted that Dr. Baerwald has made out a strong case for
his own agnostic attitude. The book is a valuable contribution
to the serious literature of the subject, and its attractive format
and clear type make it an ideal handbook for the beginner who
wishes to become acquainted with psychical research from the
point of view of the educated and impartial observer.

NOTICE.
CONCERNING "THE BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHICAL
RESEARCH"
'On account of a danger of confusion we think it right to point
out that a new association calling itself " The National Labora-
tory of Psychical Research " and publishing an official organ
styled the British Journal of Psychical Research has no con-
nection whatever with our Society. It is regrettable that
names shoiald have been chosen for this new association and
its publication likely to lead to misunderstanding, especially
.abroad.

CASES.
P. 296. A Premonitory Dream.
We print below a case of a premonitory dream concerning
an accident, which has come to us through Sir Oliver Lodge,
to whom the original report was sent by Lord Latymer, as
follows :
^rd April, 1926.
Apropos of your article in the Strand Magazine—I had an
experience four years ago which may be worth putting on paper,
as small scraps of evidence are worth preserving :
My wife came into my dressing-room one morning in January,
1922,1 while I was shaving, and said :
—" Now do be careful
hunting to-day, as I dreamed last night that you broke your
arm and collar-bone." We were married in 1900, and I have,
except during the War, hunted regularly every winter since 1908.
My wife does not hunt herself, but had never before shown any
nervousness about my hunting, nor had she ever before issued a
warning ! I laughed and thought no more of it till I was getting
into the car at the door to start off for the Meet. She came to
see me off, and again repeated what she had said, adding, " Do
be careful, I mean it." The Meet (Portman Hounds) was at
Sturminster Newton. Hounds found a fox pretty soon, and at
the first fence I jumped, the mare I was on turned upside down,
1 But see statement by Dr. K— below.
JuLV, 1926 Cases 103
and in the scrimmage I broke my right arm, and dislocated it at
the same time ;
but, be it observed, did not break my collar-bone.
I got to a doctor pretty soon, who made me as comfortable as
possible ; and then I rang up my wife on the 'phone, as I was
some way from home, to say what had happened. I shall never
forget the gasp of mingled relief and confirmation which my
tidings evoked.
That is about all. My wife cannot and never could remember
exactly what she dreamed—what form the dream took. That had
vanished by the time I questioned her about it ;
only the warning
remained planted firmly and seriously in her mind.
What is a little odd, and to my mind significant, is that the
whole of the warning was not fulfilled, though it very .well might
have been. Doesn't it look rather as if the issuer of the warning
(I am purposely vague) saw the accident in some way, and came
to the conclusion that that kind of fall would mean a broken
collar-bone as well as arm ? The prophecy can't have been based
on actual knowledge of what was to occur.
Latymee.
This letter was acknowledged by Sir Oliver Lodge and
forwarded to the Editor, i'lrs Salter, who on April 13th wrote
a letter to Lord Latymer in w^hich she asked whether
(a) a first-hand report of her dream could be obtained from
Lady Latymer ;
(6) the dream might have induced some feeling of nervous-
ness which had in some way brought about its fulfilment
;
(c) the exact date of the occurrence could be ascertained ;
(d) there was any objection to printing the Case in the
Journal with the names of those concerned.
In reply to this communication the following letters were
received from Lord and Lady Latymer :
I.
20th April, 1926.
. , . My wife is quite willing to write a short statement about
her dream. ... I cannot give the actual date of my accident
with the Portman, as I do not keep a diary. Perhaps someone
in the Himt may have a record as to the day on which they met
at Sturminster Newton in Jan. 1922—I wiU try to find out. I can
104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1926
state with absolute confidence that I thought no more of what
my wife said to me as I was driving away from the front door,
nor of the earlier warning, until I rang her up on the 'phone to
say what had happened. Most emphatically there was no feeling
of nervousness. I laughed at what she said as a joke, and
forgot all about it till an hour after the accident. T suppose
shock and pain prevented me from remembering about it sooner.
My wife did not show any particular nervousness, but was
impressed in spite of herself.
Latymer.
You can print my letter in your Journal, certainly.
II.
2lst April, 1926.
In reply to your letter to my husband. Lord Latymer, about
a dream I had in 1922—I am quite willing to answer anytiling
in my power, but the whole affair was really very simple and
without detail, although quite clear and definite. I cannot give
you the exact date—possibly it could be traced by the doctor
who set his arm, or the doctor who X-rayed it. I never had
any previous premonition, I was not specially nervous, and my
husband had had no hunting accident, for at any rate years.
The facts are as follows : —I dreamt that my husband broke
his arm, and I believed his collar-bone, owing to a riding accident.
On waking I could not remember the details, but was very im-
pressed with the facts. I did not have quite the sensation of
an ordinary dream. I was impressed, but it is difficult to explain.
I went to my husband's dressing-room and told him, but could
not remember any details—beyond the fact that he was riding.
I told him again before he started. Of course he laughed and I
could not consider the matter seriously. At the same time I
remembered the dream with apprehension. When he telephoned
to me after the accident I was not surprised, but certainly felt
perturbed at the fulfilling of the premonition. I have never had
anything of the sort happen since. He broke his arm—but not
the collar-bone—although the doctor expressed surprise that that
was not broken too. That is all there is to state. I don't object
to my name being given privately—but do not wish it to be
published in a public journal ;
private circulation is all right. . . .
Hester Latymer.
JULT, 1926 Cases 105
In replv to an enquiry addressed to him by Mrs. Salter, the
doctor who attended Lord Latymer on the occasion of his
accident writes
;
26/6/26.
In reply to your letter, my records have it that Lord Latymer met
with the accident described on February 4th, 1921.
G— K—
It will be seen that Lord Latymer was mistaken in his re-
collection that the accident occurred in January, 1922 ; this slip
of memory on his part does not, however, materially afiect the
evidence. '

II.
L. 1273. A Telepathic Dream.
The foUoAsdng case of a dream, which appears to have been in
part, at least, of telepathic origin, was first reported to the
Secretary, ]\Iiss Newton, by the dreamer, IMiss Hornibrook, with
whom ]\'Iiss Newton is personally acquainted. Miss Newton
writes as follows :
On the 18th of February, 1926, Miss Hornibrook, who was
passing through London on her way from Guildford to Suffolk,
lunched with me and related her dream and the apparent confir-
mation of it which was contained in a letter that she had received
from her sister in Persia that morning. She subsequently sent me
the following accounts :
Miss Hornibrook's Statement.
On the morning of Feb. 17tli I awoke suddenly in the midst
of a very vivid dream about the twins,—so vivid that when my
friend Miss Jackson came into the room a little later, I told it to
her, adding that I hoped the twins were all right.
I thought I was walking alone—strolling without any object—in
a dull, gloomy place, out of doors. There was apparently no
vegetation and it was either a very grey day or twilight. To
my left and a little in front of me were shallow pools of muddy
water, some of them large enough to be called ponds, but none
more than about a foot deep. Presently, as I strolled along, I
became aware that the twins were paddling about in them, though
I saw no one else near. Suddenly there was a sound of a splash
106 Journal of Society for Psychical Research jult, 1926
and little Arthur's voice screaming. I ran for all I was worth
towards the muddy water where I could see him almost on his
back with his head up yelling, and up to his elbows and knees
in thick mud^ unable to move. As I ran I became aware that a
man was running towards him also, but from the opposite direc-
tion. I got there first, and putting my hands underneath him,
lifted him out with a squelch, and started to carry him, still
crying, back towards a house. As I walked I found the man was
walking beside me, and the thought crossed my mind that I had
not seen his face and wondered who he was, but decided I could
not bother to look at him as I had to quiet little Arthur and get
the mud off him. Then I awoke.
A. B. HORNIBROOK.
Corroborative statements have also been obtained from two
friends of Miss Hornibrook's to whom she related the dream
before she received the verification of it in the letter from her
sister. These statements were contained in a letter to Miss
Hornibrook, as follows :
Feb. 24 [1926].
As far as I can remember this is what you told me of your
dream on Tues. Feb. 16th.i
You said that you dreamt that Arthur had fallen in a pond.
You ran out to rescue him and there was some man who was
also running, only you didn't see his face. You said Arthur was
covered with mud almost up to his chin, as he was in a kneeling
position on his hands and knees and had sunk in and was stuck.
You said you had a little difficulty in getting him out, but
managed to lift him out and carry him to the house.
G. Hamilton Jackson.
This is what I also can remember you telling me.
I. Hamilton Jackson.
AVith regard to the first of these corroborative statements
Miss Hornibrook wrote to Miss Newton thus :
March 6th, 26.
I enclose Greta's letter, but am afraid it is not much good about
my dream, as she says I told her the little man was in a kneeling
^This is evidently a slip of the pen for Feb. 17tli—see Miss Hornibrook's
statement.
July, 1926 Cases 107
position. As a matter of fact, what I said was that he was
stuck in the mud up to his elbows and knees, and she took it
that he must have fallen forward, whereas I meant to give her
the impression that he was in a sitting position, or almost lying
on his back. I also told her a very shallow muddy sort of pond,
more like a bog. I will find Eileen's account of the incident and
enclose it. The rest of Grreta's account is all right, as I told it
to her ...
Amy B. Hornibrook.
P.S.—l see that Eileen does ..not specifically state that Arthur
Avas on his back, but in my dream he was. I enclose the whole
letter, as you may like to read it. The story about Arthur is
on the last page.
The following is an extract from the letter referred to :
110 Bungalow, c/o A.P.O.C.,
]\Iasjid Suliman,
Via Ahwaz,
G. or P.,
Jan. mil, 26.
... Oh, I must tell you about New Year's Day before I stop.
It was a pouring wet day and when itjjains here the place gets
thick with mud in no time. It had been raining the day before
too, and the twins were a bit fed up with the house and begged
to go out, so I put on their boots and stockings, coats and hats
and turned them out—then I went to dress for we had been up
till the early hours of the morn at a dance. Just as I was
finishing dressing I heard yells of " Mummy " and I seized a coat
and dashed out to meet Billo running in from the hill opposite
our gate. He said would I come and rescue Arthur who was
stuck. So I ran off, slipping about in the mud, and eventually
found Arthur in a sunken bit of ground up to his knees in thick
slime—unable to budge—his hands had clawed the bank and were
.also up to the elbows in mud. I was just reaching him when a
coolie on the hill saw the position and came down to lift Arthur
•out. He stepped into the mud and caught Arthur under the
arms to haul him out, but Arthur objected to a coolie touching
iim and started screaming and pushed the coolie, who promptly
sat down in it ! I tried to argue with Arthur and the coolie
108 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 192G;
jabbered in his own language, and Arthur howled and struggled
with the coolie, but at length the coolie hauled him out and we
got back to the bungalow. Well, honestly, you've never seen such
a sight in all your life ! He was up to his knees in thick slime-
and really it took me about five minutes scraping the mud of?
with my hands before I could even find his boots or laces to get
them ofJ ! But I thought Billo was very sensibile—he said to me
afterwards, " You know. Mummy, if I had seen that coolie first
I could have asked him to get Arthur out and not worried you."'
Miss Newton writes :
The dream recalled to me a remark made by Miss Hornibrook
when, staying with her last summer, I took the twins for a walk.
As she saw us oiJ at the gate she said to Arthur, " Now, don't
fall down in the mud," and added in explanation to me, " If
there is any mud anywhere Arthur will fall down in it." The
prediction proved true, and the accident was triumphantly reported
by Billy on our return.
It seemed to me, therefore, that the dream might be merely
an association dream, and I asked Miss Hornibrook if anything
had occurred on the previous day to remind her of the children.
She answered No—but added that Mrs. Jackson on hearing of the
dream had at once attributed it to a picture in the Dcdly Mirror
the day before of two little boys who had been drowned in a
pond. Miss Hornibrook told me that she had read the Daily
Mirror during the evening, but had no recollection of having seen.
the picture or any reference to the accident.
The printed matter in connection with the picture in the Daily
Mirror of February 16th is as follows :
BROTHERS DROWNED : Two little brothers, Henry Harris
(left), aged seven, and Robert Harris, aged six, who were
found drowned in a pond near their home at Hadleigh (Essex).
They did not return home from Sunday school, and the
tragedy was discovered by their mother when a search was
made.
It is reasonable to suppose that the picture might have started
the dream, for a pond had been the cause of a good deal of
anxiety to Miss Hornibrook in connexion with the twins. They
were very young (born in May, 1921) and were left in her sole
July, 1'J2(; Cases 109'
charge for a year, until they went out last September to their
parents in Persia. The pond was divided from the garden in
which they played by a rather low railing, which attracted them ;
if they had climbed it they would probably have fallen head first
into the water, and I knew that Miss Hornibrook worried about
this possibility. On April 9th I addressed to her the following,
questions, to which she appended her replies :
^
(1) Do you often dream of Billy and Arthur?
Occasionally.
(2) // so, have you ever dreamed before of mud in connexion with
them ?
No.
(3) Have you noticed any recurrent feature in your dreams of
them ?
No.
(4) Did you relate the dream at hreahfast because it had been
'particularly vivid, or were you reminded of it by someone else ?
Yes, it was so vivid that I told Greta before breakfast when
she came into my room before I was up.
(5) Will you please think of all the little natural accidents asso-
ciated ivith mud that have befallen Arthur that you can remember.
Was there a man associated with any one of them, e.g., passing at
the time, or helping Arthur to get up again ?
No, I never remember any man being present when Arthur fell
in the mud.
(6) / have the newspaper with the account of the two little boys
'
falling into a pond, and I think that you must have seen it {though
you may not remember looking at it), for there is a photograph of
the children in a conspicuous place. I am inclined, to think that you
may have subconsciously received a telepathic or clairvoyant impres-
sion of Arthur's accident at about the time either when it occurred
or when Eileen wrote the letter, and that it emerged with other
associations in your mind when these associations ivere stimulated bij
the idea that started the dream, viz., the accident to the two children
reported in the " Daily Mirror.'"
I must have seen it as I had the Mirror, hut I did not remem-
ber seeing it when Mrs. Jackson mentioned it the next day.
^The questions put by Miss Newton are printed in italics.
110 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1926
We print this case because it is suggestive of the kind of
way in which an impression telepathically received may be
helped to emerge into consciousness by natural associations in
the percipient's mind. It is possible that the impression was
originally received by Miss Hornibrook either when the incident
in question occurred (New Year's Day) or when her sister
wrote the account of the incident as printed above (January 13,
1926) ; on this point evidence is for ob\'ious reasons unobtain-
able. As evidence of the partly telepathic origin of the dream
it is worth noting that the man who figured in the dream can
be accounted for as representing the coolie who figured in the
actual incident, whereas he is not accounted for either by the
report of the drowning accident in the Daily Mirror, or by Miss
Hornibrook's association of the boy Arthur with adventures in
the mud. On the other hand, it is reasonable to suppose that
the dream was, so to speak, precipitated both by these asso-
ciations and, more immediately, by Miss Hornibrook's attention
being called to the drowning of two little boys. It is possible
also that the near approach of the letter, received by Miss
Hornibrook on February 18, 1926, the day after her dream,
played some part in the emergence of the telepathic impression.

392-394, and Vol. II., p. 324).
NOTE ON THE " OSCAR WILDE " SCRIPT.i
By S. G. Soal.
It may not be without interest to point out the probable
source of a certain passage in the " Oscar Wilde " script.
This occurs in the third script written by me on July 2, 1923,
in the presence of Mrs. Travers-Smith.^ The soi-disant " Wilde
"
describing his posthumous attempts to see through the eyes
of living people writes :
... I have found sight in the most curious places. Through
the eyes out of the dusky face of a Tamil girl I have looked on
igee Review by Mrs. Henry Sidgwick, Proc. S.P.E., Vol. XXXIV., pp. 1S6-
196, and bibliography there given.
^ See Psychic Messages from Oscar Wilde, by Mrs. Travers Smith, p. 18.
July, 1926 Note on the " Oscar Wilde " Script 111
the tea fields of Ceylon and through the eyes of a wandering
Kurd, I have seen Ararat and the Yezedes luho worship both God
and Satan and who Jove only snakes and peacocks.
I think it will be agreed that the portion in italics is charac-
teristic of the living Wilde in his most bizarre and fanciful
mood. Without incongruity or literary offence it might be
interpolated, for instance, into the following passage taken from
" The Fisherman and his Soul " and thus used :
When the dwellers in the villages saw us coming, they poisoned
the wells and fled to the hill-summits. We fought with the
Magadae who are born old. and grow younger every year and die
when they are little children ; and with the Laktroi who say that
they are the sons of tigers and paint themselves yellow and black ;
and with the Yezedes who worship both God and Satan and who
love only snakes and peacocks ; with the Aurantes who bury their
dead on the tops of trees and themselves He in dark caverns, lest
the Sun who is their god should slay them ; and with the Krim-
nians who worship a crocodile and give it ear-rings of green glass
and feed it with butter and fresh fowls . . .
The passage in question, however, does not occur in any
published work of Wilde, and only quite recently I have dis-
covered what would appear to be its source.
In Vol. I., p. 227, of Peoples of all Nations, edited by J. A.
Hammerton, is a picture of a woman devil-worshipper with the
following note.
WOMAN DEVIL-WORSHIPPER OF MOUNT ARARAT.
She helongs to the far scattered sect of the Yezedes ivho worship
both God and Satan and are devoted to peacocks, snakes, water and
the sun. They are forbidden to learn reading and writing.
This book was undoubtedly in my possession at the time of
the sitting. The work was published in serial form in fort-
nightly parts, but I received it from the newsagent in bound
volumes at intervals of seven or eight weeks. By the begin-
ning of July, 1923, I must have had several of these volumes
on my shelves.
It is just possible that in the sentence which follows the one
quoted (in the same script) we have an echo of the concluding
112 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, I92s
line of Harold Munro's Children of Love (Georgian Poetry,
1913-1915), a poem which I had certainly read some years
before the sitting, since I received the book as a present in
1918.
The last line of the poem reads, " But Jesus went weeping
away and left him there wondering why," and this may be
compared with the following sentence from the script
:
Once iu a pleasure steamer on its way to St. Cloud I saw the
green waters of the Seine and the lights of Paris through the
vision of a little girl who clung weeping to her mother and
wondered why.
We have now succeeded in tracing many passages in these-
scripts to their probable origins. The greater part of the
first script, for instance, seems definitely plagiarised from De
Profundis. The literary criticisms of modern writers (at least
those contained in my own script) seem modelled on those
contained in Wilde's essay, The Decay of Lying. The know-
ledge of Poincare, Kepler, Tycho Brake, etc., is probably derived
from my own mind. The references to incidents in the life
of Wilde seem to have been gathered from different printed
sources. The variety of sources from which the script is
drawn is as amazing as the adroitness with which the know-
ledge is worked up into sentences conveying impressions of the
different mannerisms of Wilde's literary style. But as Dr.
Schiller rightly remarks in another connection, by tracing the
facts to their source one does not thereby identify the mind
that is responsible for the selection.
If, however, it shoidd eventually turn out that in cases
where the communicators are shown to be purely fictitious
characters the supernormal selection of material to support the
impersonation is as varied and ingenious as in the apparently
spiritistic cases, then we should have at least a presumption in
favour of the view that in these latter also the supernormal
selection may be the work of living minds.
We freely admit, however, that much more experiment is
required on these fictitious cases, and suggest that such com-
munications shoidd be deliberately encouraged by those under-
taking sittings with mediums.

CORRESPONDENCE.
I. The Cases of Moss and Munxixgs.
To the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.
Madam,—In the account of these cases printed in the May
Journal, No. 425, p. 71 ff., you have not made the very pertinent
remark that in each case it was the observations and the initia-
tive of spiritualists which exposed the fraud. In both instances
it might easily have been dealt with privately, but Mr. M'Kenzie
of the Ps3^chic College, in the first instance, and the signatories
in the second, including Mr. Bradley, insisted upon the fullest
publicity.
As to Munnings, your article seems to sneer at those who main-
tain that the man had true psychic power in spite of his roguery.
I would remind the writer that in the Cambridge experiments the
S.P.R. , or some of its leading members, turned down Busapia
Palladino as fraudulent on account of her obvious tricks, and yet
that a sub-committee of the same Society, including Mr. Baggally,
the Hon. Everard Feilding and Mr. Carrington afterwards reported
that the psychic powers were genuine. What was true of Eusapia
may well be true also of Munnings.
Arthur Conan Doyle.
ii. coisrceening a supposed premonitory impression printed
IN THE Journal.
To the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.
Madam,—It was not until I saw an account of a case of sup-
posed prevision (reported in the ^S.P.i?. Journal, Vol. XVI., pp. 29-31)
that I knew that it had been included in your records.
The case was, briefly, that a quarry owner visited his quarry
on a certain morning, and that after leaving, he sent a telegram
from an office a few miles away warning the local manager that-
a fall of rock was impending, which afterwards came down.
After making certain enquiries I find that this case is one that
occurred in Carnarvonshire and with which I was familiar. It
caused a good deal of comment among slate-quarry managers at
114 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1926
the time, almost entirely adverse to the idea that the sending of
the telegram was due to premonitory influence.
Had this wire been sent without the sender having visited the
quarry within, say, forty-eight hours, there would be strong grounds
to attribute the case to some psychical agency, but the fact that
he had been to the quarry within a few hours renders this most
improbable.
It may here be stated that for ten years the writer of this
memorandum acted as local manager to one of the largest slate
quarries in that section, one adjoining the quarry that this case
refers to. It was my responsibility amongst others to see that
the rock was safe for the workmen, and it was my misfortune,,
owing to the way that quarry had previously been opened up, to-
acquire expert knowledge of everything appertaining to " falls."
Perhaps it should be mentioned here that slate-rock should be
brought down systematically in blocks, and that " falls " are a
calamity. After leaving here I took charge of the well-known
Penrhyn Slate Quarries, where I have been now fifteen years.
Fortunately, it is an extremely rare occurrence for any consider-
able body of rock to come down without giving plenty of warning.
The most common is for small pieces to flake away and come
down. Usually these are too small to be harmful. Other indi-
cations are the appearance of surface cracks, a veining of the face
of the rock itself, slight noises, and certain indications known only
to quarry men themselves and unexplainable by them. It is the
duty for the overlookers to be looking out continually for these
warnings in order to report them to the manager.
It is important also to remember that the Mr. John referred
to had not only been familiar with quarrying operations since his
boyhood, but that his father and grandfather had similar, if not
greater experience, so that he may have had from them some
inherent instinct.
The natural explanation, therefore, is that his eyes (possibly,
but not probably, his ears) registered some indication that a fall
was impending, but that this information was not transferred to
the mind until some time later—nearly everyone can recall similar
experiences. Often the information is not transferred till an
ensuing incident occurs to stimulate it.
Eortunately the loss of life owing to these warnings is almost
unknown where falls are concerned, though less happily accidents
July, 1926 Review 115
do sometimes occur owing to comparatively small pieces of rock,
often only a few pounds in weight, falling down from the working
face of the rock down on to a man working below.
Walter D. Hobson.
I have worked at the Penrhyn Slate Quarry for 56 years in
every capacity, from quarryman's apprentice to quarry manager,
and what has been written above is in accordance with my views
and experience.

REVIEW.
Wunder der Hypnose, erweiterte Hypnotherapie. By Ubald Tar-
TARUGA. Pfullingen, Johannes Baum. Pp. 42. With 15
illustrations.
This is No. 11 of the pamphlets produced by the Parapsychic
Institute of Vienna. In it Dr. Tartaruga, after a short historical
introduction, calls iu question " the current medical opinion that
suggestion " is a sufficient explanation of all the facts of hyjJ-
notism. He refers to Dr. Alrutz's experiments to show that
there is also some physical influence, and relates the investigation
conducted by the Parapsychic Institute into the claims of a
professional hypnotizer in Vienna, one August Grundmann. A
noted Viennese psychiatrist having denied that the subjects to
whom a " hypnotic crime " had been suggested were really unaware
that it was not a real crime, Grundmann undertook to convince
him of his error by an assassination aimed at himself ; he sug-
gested to his subject, a young girl, a motive for hating the doctor,
and equipped her with a revolver she had every reason to believe
would go off successfully. The result was, that the subject lay
in wait for the doctor for three days, and then made her attempt^
which got into the papers, and made a great sensation. Grund-
mann was arrested as an accomplice, but was able to show that
the whole affair was only a scientific experiment. In addition to
this he claimed to be able to enlarge, by suggestions, the breasts
of some female subjects unilaterally, to enable a patient who had
been paralysed and had sustained curvature of his backbone in
consequence of acute poliomyelitis, and been declared "incurable," to
walk and to carry burdens of 130 pounds, and lastly to duplicate
116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1926
(with another subject) the performances of the Oriental fakirs
"
in perambulating or lying on boards set with sharp nails, without
injury to the skin of their soles or back. All these claims were
verified at the Parapsychic Institute, and seem to be convincingly
illustrated by the photographs of the subjects. Dr. Tartaruga
very justly insists that these results are sufficiently remarkable to
render it the duty of the medical profession to study and to
utilize the possible extensions of hypnotic therapy which are thus
indicated.

NOTES ON PEEIODICALS.
The Journal of Ahnormal and Social Psychology for April has the
"welcome news that an anonymous benefactor has donated a fund
to Harvard University for the purpose of founding a Ghair of
Abnormal and Dynamic Psychology. We are glad to note that
a number of voluntary assistants may be appointed, so that
annually a number of students may have the opportunity to
become familiar with abnormal phenomena. It is to be hoped
that the example may be followed elsewhere, and also that the
interest in abnormal mental states thereby aroused may spread to
a consideration of the phenomena at present investigated almost
solely by psychical researchers.
The Zeitschrift fur Parapsychologie for June has a long criticism
by Mr. Karl Krall of the theory of Lehmann and Hansen regard-
ing involuntary whis^^ering in experiments for thought transference.
He points out that those who cannot control an impulse to
whisper during such exjaeriments should be excluded, and he
minimises the difficulty of detecting involuntary whispering,
insisting on the necessity of keeping the mouth entirely closed.

TPIREE NEWSPAPER TESTS.
By A. W. Trethewy.
The Rev. Charles Drayton Thomas has been continuing the
series of newspaper tests of which an early selection aj)peared
in the S.P.R. Journal for May, 1921, and others formed the
subject of his book Some New Evidence for Human Stirvival,
published by Messrs. Collins Sons & Co., Glasgow, 1922. The
present article relates to three cases subsequent to those set
forth in that book.
OcTOBEK, 1926 Three Newspaper Tests 119
In two of them, those relating to Ray and Beard, it was
practically impossible for the medium, Mrs. Osborne Leonard,
or the sitter, the Rev. Charles Drayton Thomas, at the time
when the tests were given to have had by normal methods
the information which was to be verified. Their ignorance
did not merely relate to the contents of a newspaper not yet
in print, but extended to the antecedent facts alleged, which
were expressed in so cryptic a manner that the names of the
two persons concerned, alleged to be dead, were not disclosed.
The third case, that of Strevett, which will be described
first, did not originate with a newspaper test, but reached
that stage only after his death was known. It is included
because it occurred during the same period as the other two,
and the three are so closely connected that they must all be
considered together.
I. The Strevett Case.
Strevett was a man who had been known at The Lcysian
Mission, City Road, E.C. 1, for many years ; Mr. Thomas
gives the following account
:
My colleagues had occasionally helped him, and in later years
I believe he came to regard me as one of the few who under-
stood him and to whom he might turn for help when increasing
weakness rendered it difficult to obtain a liviii£>'. During recent
years I occasionally visited him in hospital and infirmary. I had
not heard of him for some weeks wlien the following incident
took place at a sitting with Mis. Leonard on November 11th,
1921. Feda (the control) suddenly asked:
Feda. Have you lu'ard of someone who lias just passed
over ?
1 r('])iii'd that 1 had not.
Feua. 1 feid a peculiar condition, not quite in the sitting.
It is as if someone who knows you had just passed
over and was sending thought towards you.
I inquired how she could be aware tliat this person
had only recently passed.
Feda. Because it is a new feeling and as if lie had not
done it before. It feels like a rather old person,
Feda gets a tired feeling with it.
120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 192()
I a.sked whether she supposed that someone was
thinking of me because I was just then at a
sitting.
Feda. Yes, liut he has not quite the power to come here
himself.
I then wished to know whether my communicators,
Father and Sister, were also aware of this.
Feda. They are not taking any notice of it. It is sent to
you, not to them. Feda gets it because it is sent
to you and she is in touch with you now through
the medium. Spirits often send thoughts which
those in the body cannot feel ;
although their
subconscious mind receives the impression the
conscious mind does not understand it, but may
yet feel vaguely comforted. A¥ere the conscious
mind psychically developed it might get part of
the message. Your Father says that Feda can
get it, although it does not reach your conscious
mind, because her mind is more receptive to any-
thing of this sort. The thought is sent out to
you, and as you fail to receive it it flies on to the
next receiving station and is there caught, some-
thing like picking up a wireless message.
I remark that I cannot guess who it may be that is
thinking of me.
Feda. It feels like a man, Feda cannot tell Iwtv she feels
that, but it is like when one knows a thing without
knowing how it is known. You will be sure to
hear about this and it will be interesting. Feda
feels it is some one nice, for it is a nice feeling.
The day following this sitting I left home and was away for
six days, i.e. from the 12th to the 18th. My first intimation of
Strevett';< death was when, on my return, I learnt of a telephone
message from the Coroner saying that a man named Strevett,
who had died suddenly in the Infirmary, had given my name as
the person to be informed in case of death. Calling at the
Infirmary I learnt that Strevett had been admitted on the 7th
of November and that they had posted me an admission card on
the 11th (the day of the sitting), and that he had died in his
October, 1926 Three Newspaper Tests 121
sleep on the night of the 13th. There is no doubt but that
Strevett would have been thinking about me, hoping and expecting
to see me ; and as he was very ill, and possibly anticipating
his end, such thoughts may possibly have originated the feeling
of which Feda spoke. On the chance of getting some interesting
remarks I briefly stated at my next sitting, November 2.5th,
1921, that the person apparently referred to by Feda as recently
passed had not died until two days afterwards ; and I inquired
whether Feda considered that her impressions might have been
produced by his thoughts being directed towards me ? She
replied :
Feda. Yes, it is sure to have been that. But such a
thing only happens when death is certain. ^
I objected that the nurses had no idea that he was
about to die.
Feda. But his spirit might have been aware of it. Your
Father says, '"
The subconscious mind is the greater
or spirit mind and it often knows about events
which are going to affect it in the near future,
especially such an important change as passing from
the body, a matter which the conscious mind
might only know in rare instances. Often in
earth life, when an important change is coming,
you may feel that something is impending although
you may have no inkling of its nature."
Feda could not see that man, but only knew and
felt. Your Father remarks that it is an interesting
point that neither he nor Etta knew. Had the
man been over on their side and separated from
his body they think they would have at least felt
his presence, even if not actually seeing him.
Daring this discussion, Mr. Thomas may, he thinks, have
mentioned Strevett's surname, but not his Christian name.
The subsequent development of the case is recorded by Mr.
Thomas, as follows :
1 1 recalled this to Feda at a sitting on May 14th. 1926, after Mr.
Trethewy had raised the point, and asked her what exactlj' she had meant.
She replied that she had alluded to "foreknowledges of death," the man's
soul had foreseen the approaching end although he might not have been
conscious of it in his mind. C. D. T.

122 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1926
At the sitting of January 20th, 1922, the following was one of
the tests given for verification from the morrow's Times :
The Times to-morrow, page one, column one, a little lower
than half down, is a name of the old man who passed over
and visited us here in his astral body before he finally
passed.
Looking next morning at the place indicated I found the
Christian name of my poor friend Strevett, namely, Ebenezer.
This was between three-quarters and half-way down the first
column, and it is a name not frequently found there. The
phrasing of this test shows my communicator's opinion of the
real significance of the Strevett episode. As to his use of the
term " astral body," he has explained that this and similar ones
are only employed for lack of better, and that they suffice to
convey the general meaning.
During the four years which have passed since the above I
have received several communications ostensibly from Strevett.
Their internal evidence and character leave no doubt in my mind
as to the Strevett authorship. Considerations of space preclude
their inclusion here.
Of course the evidence of Strevett's identity is not strong.
It is based on the coincidence of Strevett's dying condition
with the occurrence of the attempted message noticed by Feda,
and on his relations with Mr. Thomas which render the attempt
conceivable. The theory is a plausible speculation, but there
is no corroboration except the Ebenezer test, which is not
conclusive because the name was known to the sitter, and
therefore, perhaps, to the medium ; for in the passage above
quoted Feda says that she is in touch with Mr. Thomas.
It is possible that looking through the paper with his sub-
liminal memory at her command she came on the name
Ebenezer and realised that it fitted the case. If Mr. Thomas
had not guessed that Strevett was the person who was said
to have tried to communicate with him, nothing might have
been heard of his name. On the other hand there is notliing
impossible in the claim, and considering its association with
the other two cases which are supported by stronger evidence,
we may be justified in believing that it may be true, though
ocTOBEE, 1926 Three Newspaper Tests 123
incapable of proof. Of course tliere is no reason to suppose
that the medium Mrs. Osborne Leonard could have been
normally conscious that Strevett's name was Ebenezer.
II. The Beard Case.
Mr Thomas writes :
On January 6th, 1922, during my usual fortnightly sitting with
Mrs. Leonard, Feda gave the following message from my Father
and Sister. These were my regular communicators, and they
both had given me conclusive proofs of their identity. My
Father passed over in 1903, and my Sister in 1920.
Something about one who passed quite lately, it is one whom
they have been helping,^ and who went rather quickly.
Your Father is very serious about this, as if he wishes to
be careful.
Then followed some clues to the identity of the deceased,
some newspaper tests concerning him, and some more clues.
These clues and tests will be stated in detail below. Nothing
more need be said about them at present than that they gave
no indication of identity to Mr. Thomas at the time. His
report is continued with reference to the same sitting :
Presently Feda bid farewell and my Father took her place as
control. While speaking directly through the medium he intro-
duced a reference to the abovementioned Strevett episode, but
without giving the name, and asked me if I had carefully noted
what had been said respecting that class of incident. On my
replying in the affirmative he continued :
Note that that may happen again to you. It would be
important to prove if it be possible for the soul to know
when it is about to be freed. I am not certain if it can
know excepting when the freedom is very near at hand.
I then asked whether he intended to connect these remarks
with the person who formed the subject of the Times test.
^ The nature of the help given was not indicated. On several other
occasions, however, allusion has been made to their efforts in relieving
illness of friends on earth, also to giving guidance and instruction to those
recently passed over. C. D. T.
124 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1926
He replied, " Do not press. I do not want to spoil things."
There was some further conversation which left me with the
impression that the subject of the day's tests might not yet have
actually passed, but be upon the verge of doing so.
Scrutiny of the next day's Times and Morning Post did not
help me ; I could only think of one person to whom the reference
might just possibly apply, and inquiries immediately proved that
it did not in any way connect with him.
Six days later I saw in our Church paper, The Methodist Re-
corder, a notice as follows :
Beard. January 7th, at Southborough, near Tunbridge
Wells, Rev. Samuel Wesley Beard ;
aged eighty years.
Remembering that Mr. Beard had been known to his parents,
and that the initial " B " had been declared applicable to the
deceased in one of the newspaper tests of January 6th, Mr.
Thomas brought up the subject at his next seance, on January
20tli, 1922, and after some conversation, which will be repeated
in detail below, asked if the deceased was Mr. Beard, and
received a reply in the affirmative.
At this stage a further quotation from Mr. Thomas's report
is given ;
On returning home with this further information I was in a
position to examine the Times and the Morning Post for January
7th, and determine how far any correspondence discovered there
might apply to Mr. Beard. It is important to place on record
how little I kneAV about him at this time, merely the few facts
following :
He had been occasionally mentioned by my Mother as a Minister
who retired and went to live near .Tunbridge Wells many years
ago, and whose retirement had been necessitated by an unusual
form of throat trouble which, however, did not prevent his taking
numerous preaching appointments in Tunbridge Wells and the
surrounding villages. Further than this I knew nothing, except
that he must be elderly. To the best of my recollection I had
never seen him, and certainly knew nothing whatever about his
family.
My first discoveries were as follows :
HiWs List, a reference book relating to Wesleyan Ministers,
showed in what towns the Rev. Samuel W. Beard had worked
OCTOBEE, 1926 Three Newspaper Tests 125
during his Ministerial career, and from it I learnt, to my sur-
prise, tliat he had been my father's colleague at Taunton a year
before my birth there.
I had frequently heard my parents speak of a family named
French at Taunton and of Mr. French's friendship with our
Ministers. It therefore seemed probable that this Mr. French would
in those days have been intimate with his young minister, Mr.
Beard, and that he might be the Fr named in one of the
tests of the sitting of January 6th.
The results of the inquiries made by Mr. Thomas into the
tests and clues were stated by him as follows :
The initial message on January 6th, 1922, was
:
Something about one who passed quite lately, it is one whom
they have been helping and who went rather quickly.
Your Father is very serious about this, as if he wishes
to be careful. Why does he give " M " ? He keeps
giving " M," and yet Feda does not feel as if it is the
person's name, though it would connect very closely.
This initial suggests Miss Beard's name, Mary. She had been
in attendance on her father since leaving school, and has been
his one companion during the five years since Mrs. Beard
passed.
They speak of being surprised at the passing, as if it took
them by surprise. It is one whom they thought could
still do something on earth. It looked like being prema-
ture, but Etta shakes her head and says "It is all right."
Fr , Fra , Feda cannot get the name, but it is
mixed up in a newspaper test purposely in case he failed
to give it clearly this way.
That they were correct in thinking Mr. Beard might have done
further work, and that his passing took them rather by surjsrise,
may be gathered from the fact that he had been preaching
during the previous quarter and had promised to do so again in
three months' time, but asked to be given no appointments
meanwhile as he was unwell.
" Fr , Fra " ; this appears to be an attempt for the
name French which was found in the next day's Morning Post
(see below).
126 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1926
Then at 2.45 p.m. on the same day, January 6th, came the
series of tests relating to the Times and Morning Post for
the following day, January 7th, of which a copy was posted to
the S.P.R. on the 6th
:
Times to-morrow, page one, column two, upper half but not
quite top, say one quarter down. Name of the j)erson
passed recently, not sure if Christian name or not.
Two inches from the top of this second column on the first
page of the Times appears the name Samuel. This is Mr. Beard's
Christian name.
Close to is another name, not his own, but of place this
person was very much connected with.
In the same advertisement with Samuel and on the line im-
mediately above it is Weston-super-Mare. In this town Mr.
Beard worked for three years. Also, a few lines higher, appears
Somerset, in which County he lived for six years, and was colleague
successively with my father and my uncle.
This person will be missed. Sudden passing, but unsatis-
factory health previously; some additional physical trouble
led to the climax, then quickly over.
Mr. Beard was certainly missed, both by his only daughter who
had been his constant companion and who was now left alone,
her only brother being stationed abroad and her mother having
predeceased her father, and by the Wesleyan Churches in and
around Tunbridge Wells, where he had for some twenty years
rendered much assistance. The references to health are correct;
Miss Beard had noticed a change in her father after their return
from holidays the previous year, and it was then discovered
that he had an internal trouble for which an operation was
advised. This internal condition greatly aggravated the throat
trouble which had compelled his retirement so long previously
as 1895. His illness lasted two weeks, and during his last two
days the condition of the throat was both painful and serious
;
so much so that he was given injections of morphia. It is per-
fectly correct to say that the internal trouble supervening upon
the previous throat condition led to a climax and that the end
was quick. , . .
An appointment made with the person, important affecting
others, could not be carried out owing to the passing.
October, 1926 Three Neivspaper Tests 127
The operation had been fixed to take place on January 5th,
in a London nursing home; but as the day approached he was
too ill to be moved, and was in fact dying.
Column one, nearly half way down, find name of a near
relative, living, of the above. " J " is given as a name
connected with the one passed and is to be found close
to that of the near relative.
Within one inch of half way down column one is Mary, the
name of his daughter. "An initial J" is in the same advertise-
ment with Mary. Mr. Beard had two brothers both of whose
names commence with "J."
" B " is given ; Feda feels sure it is to be linked with the
one passed over.
There seems little doubt that this refers to the surname. Beard.
A reference to the place he was shortly going to is made
near the bottom of column one.
The operation was to have been in London. While there are
several town addresses within four inches of the bottom of this
column the word London only appears once, and its position is
^ihe third line from the bottom of column one.
Morning Post to-morrow. He thinks this was from the
back page, left side and one quarter down ; a name re-
ferring to the same man lately passed, as given in the
Times test. Got idea re Ships close thereto.
Exactly one quarter down the first left hand column of the
last page of the Morning Post is the word French. The test
message is not quite explicit as to which person the name would
fit, but there had been a preliminary attempt to give a name
" J'r ," and, when the attempt failed, it was stated that the
name would be introduced amid the paper tests for the day. I
therefore conclude that this was an attempt to indicate the old
Taunton friend, Mr. French. Miss Beard recollects that her
father used to speak of that family.
" Ships." The line immediately followed that containing the
above name French, ends with the word Port, which perhaps,
by mental association, suggested ships. This syllable comes at
the end of a line and is continued on the next, being part of an
.address, Portland Road.
128 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1926
Page 5 : find name of a place, half way down left side, also
mentioned in Times test.
This is unsatisfactory inasmuch as no name appears there which
had been previously alluded to. It may be a complete failure.^
It is curious, however, that three inches below the halfway crease
of the first column at the left side of page 5 there should be
found the word Avalon. Avalon is the old, but still used name,
for Glastonbury, a place at which Mr. Beard, would have frequently
condacted services while he was my uncle's colleague in Somerset.
In giving this item the " sensing " or the transmission may have
been faulty.
Mr. Thomas then reports some further remarks made by
Feda at the sitting of January 6th, of which a resume may be
given, as follows :
(a) The one passed over belonged, to different conditions,
things which interested other people . . . not like those who-
interest themselves in their homes.
Tills would apply to any Wesleyan Minister, but especially to
one like Mr. Beard who had travelled in many Circuits. Mr.
Beard also had other interests, such as the study of natural
history and geology.
(6) Keference was made to " a lot of papers," and it was indi-
cated that there would be " something about this that will be
posthumous."
Mr. Thomas suggests that this refers to an Obituary Notice.
It is the custom amongst Wesleyans, he says, " to present to the
May Synod a comprehensive account of the life and work of any
minister deceased since the previous Conference. . . . Mr. Beard's
Obituary was published the following September, and may be read
on p. 113 of the Wesleyan Minutes of Conference for 1922.
(c) Eeference was made to " talking of going away a little
while ago. . . . Feda keeps getting the idea of going to another
place." Miss Beard remarks respecting this that there had been
occasional conversation as to their next holiday, and that Folke-
stone had been decided on. She had from time to time introduced
^The causes of the failures are puzzling problems. Perhaps the examina-
tion of a number of instances and the consideration of the communicators'
explanations might throw some light on the process employed in the tests..
A. W. T.
October, 1926 Three Newspaper Tests 129
the subject of his next holiday in order to cheer her father when he
was unwell.
(d) It was said that the person concerned " was connected with
a paper-test before." This statement was voluntarily corrected at
the next sitting, when it was said that the previous allusion was
not in a paper-test. Mr. Thomas has not been able to trace any
such reference to Mr. Beard.
After seeing the notice of Mr. Beard's death in the Methodist
Recorder Mr. Thomas at his next sitting, on January 20th,
1922, put some questions " in order to discover whether I
could elicit further clues to the subject of the tests of January
7th." The upshot of these questions may be summed up
from Mr. Thomas's record, as follows :
(a) The test of January 6th is " not to do with the astral
visitor" (Strevett), "nor the one before that" (Ray). [See below.]
(6)
" Not a relation," said Peda, " not one you would have seen
just previously to his passing, but you heard about him from
people with whom you come in contact. Feda gets the idea of a
group of people who will know about him at once . . . B. con-
nected with him.
The group of people among whom he was fairly well known
and who would at once hear of his passing would be those of
the Tunbridge Wells Circuit.
(c) Mr. Thomas asked the following question :
" Was he a Wes-
leyan Minister near to whom Father once lived ?
"
This question was due to a misconception on Mr. Thomas's
part, but led to a reply of some interest to the effect that his
father " was in touch with him twice with an interval between,"
and that Mr. Thomas's mother would know of this. On this
statement Mr. Thomas comments thus :
The first time of contact would be when they worked together
in Taunton ; a few years later Mr. Beard was working as
a colleague with my uncle in the Shepton Mallett Circuit,
and my father doubtless met him there when visiting my
uncle. My mother and aunt, though remembering Mr.
Beard in those distant days very distinctly, cannot vouch
for any specific visits during which my father and Mr.
Beard would have met after the interval.
130 Journal of Society for Fsycldcal Research Octobek, 1926
{d) In reply to a direct question it was stated that the man
concerned in the test was Mr. Beard.
Mr. Thomas has written the following report of a later
sitting, with the accompanying comments :
The Rev. Samuel W. Beard passed away at 1.30 a.m. on January
1th, 1922, some eight hours after the close of the first sitting in
which he was described as " passed quite recently" and very
recently indeed."
In reply to my inquiry as to her father's condition during the
day or two preceding his death, Miss Beard informed me that he
was then suffering so greatly that the Doctor injected morphia,
with the result that her father passed those hours in unconscious-
ness ; as soon as consciousness showed signs of returning he was
again put to sleep.
Some weeks later, and after I had completed the above verifica-
tions, namely, at a sitting on March 17th, 1922, the following
<:onversation took place :
Q. About Mr. Beard ; there was some ambiguity as to the
date of his passing, for he only died eight hours after
you gave me the tests about him.
A. We had the information from him.
Q. What was he doing at the time ?
A. Moving about as Etta or I, he was having a free and
independent existence apart from his physical body.
Q. And you were not clear if he had left his body or
not ?
A. I certainly thought he had left it.
Q. You had no cause for uncertainty ?
A. No ;
many spirits have left the body before physical
death, but, as a rule, it is only when there has been
a slow breaking up of physical concUtions.
Q. It seemed significant that you should have followed your
tests and remarks about him by reiminding me of
Strevett's coming, and then saying that what had
happened then might happen again ; and that when I
inquired if this was a case in point you asked me not
to press. Did you think that he was then finally
released from his body ?
October, 1926 Three Newspaper Tests 131
A. I had no doubt about it at the time of getting the
information from him ; but certainly had a glimmering
afterwards.
Q. By " afterwards " do you mean when giving me the tests
about him at the sitting ?
A. Yes ;
you will see by many things I have done that
I give better information after a thing is apparently
done with.
Q. Do you get more information then ?
A. No ; it is merely a growth of knowledge. If I found
myself on earth in a strange place, I should not im-
mediately know the place, nor where I was, but after
identifying myself with it for a little while I should
have a better knowledge. I identified myself with the
true facts more during the sitting. Can you see that 1
Q. You mean that as you spoke about him you realised
more ?
A. Do not say " realised," but suspected. I have often
met people both on my own plane and on yours,
spirits whom at first I took to be permanently separated
from their bodies. By closer touch I should sense, or
feel, if they were finally separated. I had not been
in very close touch with Mr. Beard, but got into touch,
sensing him as it were, during the sitting. There is
a reason for so many errors made by mediums during
the war ;
they were not sure which and hurriedly
jumped to conclusions.
Do not be surprised if that happens again ; you see
I shall watch more for it now, and if possible I will
bring it about. Should you suspect that I am doing
this, do not ask definite questions about it ; it is better
not.
I then asked whether there was anything further which Miss
Beard might be glad to know. The reply was that, on awaking
there, Mr. Beard had expressed a wish to see " someone whose
name," said Feda, " commences with '
E,' and also another person
whose name sounds to Feda like Winnie."
On being informed of this Miss Beard remarked that her father's
sister was named Elizabeth, and that he had been es2Deeially
132 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1926
attached to his brother Willie. Both Elizabeth and Willie had
passed some years before.
In view of the illuminating error by which my communicator
mistook Mr. Beard's condition—thinking him to be already a
resident in the higher realms, whereas his physical body lay under
the influence of anaesthetics, and did not die until several hours
later—the quotations given below receive peculiar significance.
Their dates indicate that they were given four years and two
years respectively before the Beard incident. Indeed I had quite
forgotten their existence, and only discovered them in May 1926,
when searching through my notes of earlier sittings at Mr. Tre-
thewy's request.
They show very clearly that my communicator was aware of
the possibility of iust that mistake Avhich he came to make in
his first references to Mr. Beard's passing.
Sittincj of April SOth, 1918.
Feda remarked that my father had recently met in the spirit
world some youths in whom I was interested, and added :
About one of them he was at first doubtful as to whether
or not the lad had finally passed over ; because it is
sometimes difficult to distinguish between our newly arrived
and those who are over temporarily during sleep or while
under anaesthetics. He has seen these temporary visitors
looking so developed that they might have been taken for
the ordinary inhabitants. Of course they do not all
appear so familiar.
Sitfinfj of May 21s/, 1920.
In this sitting allusion was made to visits paid to the spirit
realms by some persons during their sleep ; I thereupon inquired
whether these temporary visitors seemed as fully alert as those
living there permanently. My father, who was controlling,
replied
:
There is a difference perceptible to those who know them well.
The cord of etheric matter which still connects them with
their sleeping body is drawn from their psychic body ; it
therefore follows that a sleep-visitor is limited by the loss
of this cord substance which is connecting him with the
body. Supposing I saw someone who was only temporarily
October, 1926. Three Newspaper Tests 133
out of the body, I might not know whether his modified
brightness was, or was not, his usual appearance. For
among ourselves there are degrees of brightness, since some
vibrate more keenly with life.
I then asked whether he would be certain to distinguish, in
the case of his own relations, whether or not they had come over
finally. He said
:
If long enough with them I should know, but I might not
know if I only saw them in passing. There have been
cases where relations were spoken to by those who were
unaware that the man or woman had come over finally.
In the S.P.R. Journal, May 1923, Dr. F. C. S. Schiller con-
tributes a remarkable instance of apparent communication through
a medium by a person living, but suffering from senile dementia.
His suggestive remarks upon the case include the following
{p. 91)
:
It would seem that our conscious personality, i.e. what is
traditionally called " our soul," is not so strictly tied down
in its manifestations to its " body," nor so completely and
adequately represented by its behaviour, as it is natural,
and hence scientifically " orthodox " to suppose. The
bodily machine may become disordered in ways which
irresistibly suggest that the soul " is destroyed or deranged ;
but they do not prove this, and all the time it may be
leading a life of its own in another " sphere,"' or on another
' plane," though it cannot express this life through a body
which is no longer its possession in any effective sense. . . .
It was always a possibility that bodily functioning did not
produce the activities of mind but only conditioned their
manifestations, forming the vehicle or machine through
which they were transmitted. As a logical possibility this
suggestion had great merits—it could not, e.g. conceivably
be disposed of by any of the facts to which materialism
was wont to appeal : but it had to remain merely a
theoretic possibility in default of positive evidence in favour
of its interpretation. Now we seem to have got the re-
quisite evidence. For we seem in this case to catch a
glimpse not only of the actual correctness of the " trans-
134: Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1926
mission " theory of mind, but also of the real spiritual
agencies which are operating behind and through the veil
of material mechanisms.
There are many instances in which persons are alleged to
have functioned on another plane of existence while still in
the physical body. Stainton Moses' visions are cases in point.
His " controls " and other authorities have said that under
such conditions, which usually occur in a state of physical
unconsciousness, the aetheric or astral body is attached to the
carnal body by a thread of light. That people still on the
earth plane should confuse persons in this form with those
who have already passed is quite intelligible, but there are
few if any instances of similar mistakes being admitted by
spirit communicators who allege that they have themselves
finally passed to the other side.
Though no single newspaper test was conclusive and the
clues were rather vague, the number of coincidences seems to
be outside the scope of chance. The cumulative effects of
the points of resemblance makes out a strong case for the
identity of Samuel Beard with the person indicated by the
communicator. It is really marvellous that so much informa-
tion could be given of facts unknown to the mediu.m or sitter,
accompanied with the predictive element involved in the news-
paper tests. The most plausible theory appears to be the
spiritistic one that the information came from the sitter's
father, to whom it was known and that he devised the news-
paper tests. The alternative is to fall back upon some such
hypothesis as the existence of an akashic record, or the possi-
bility of telepathic communications from unknown sources.
I believe that the method of newspaper tests is similar to that
of book-tests, and that, as in the case of Stainton Moses, both
in the matter of book-tests and of evidential information
apparently coming from a printed source, the medium's clair-
voyance (for the want of a better term), is used for the
purpose under the guidance of external agency. As to how
the newspaper sheet is glimpsed before it is in physical exist-
ence I refrain from speculating, because I can find no reason-
able basis for an explanation.
October, 1926 Three Newspaper Tests 135
III. The Ray Case.
Of this case Mr. Thomas gives the following account
:
During a sitting with Mrs. Osborne Leonard on December
20th, 1921, references were given at 11.54 a.m. to be verified in
the morrow's Times. These were posted to the S.P.R. immediately
after the sitting in accordance with my invariable custom. Among
them was the following : I was asked to look in column one of
the first page and there find, " about half way down, the name
of a man very recently passed over about whom 3-ou have been
talking lately."
I did not know to whom this might refer, but heard that
evening of the death of Mr. Ray, one of our members at the
Leysian Mission. Some months previously he had sent for me
to visit him in hospital, and I had since then frequently discussed
his chances of recovery with my colleague who was his regular
visitor. It therefore seemed to me that the name Eay, if found
at the given place in the morrow's Times, would perfectly meet
the test.
The name appeared there in a marriage notice, Francis Ray,
and was placed less than two inches below the half-way crease
in column one. Moreover, this notice had not been present in
the previous day's issue.
This incident impressed me as additional evidence following
much of a similar character, showing how closely the communicator
was able to follow my work at the Mission. Ray had died eight
days before my sitting ; the conversation regarding him had
always been in private.
Following the above Times test was an attempt to get one on
similar lines from the Morning Post.
Morning Post; re the man passed over quite recently, there
is a name in column three, near the top ; the same name
as in the Times. Also another name of his a little lower
down. The name James seemed to come strongly and
close to the above.
Although there were syllables containing the required sound,
such as Rai, in the word rails, it cannot be said this part of the
experiment was successful. Yet it is significant that Mr. Ray's
136 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1926
Christian name was James, a fact of which I was unaware until
several days after this sitting.
It is not stated whence the communicators obtained their
knowledge of Ray's death, but the meaning appears to be
either that Ray's spirit was present at the seance, or more
probably that they (the father and sister of Mr. Thomas)
knew from their own observation that he had passed. The
case would then be similar to that of Beard, except that
Ray had really passed and was not dying, as Beard was w^hen
supposed to have passed. In other words, the external agency
of the communicators must be postulated. There is an
alternative theory : Strevett's case being taken at its face
.value, we may assume that a similar rapport existed betw^een
Mr. Thomas and Ray, resulting in Mr. Thomas being sub-
consciously aware of Ray's death, and his knowledge being
thus available to Feda, who thereby appreciated the import-
ance of the presence of Ray's name in the Times. She was
either looking for some word bearing on Ray's identity or
finding such a word thought of Ray's death as a suitable
object for a test. That the initiative came from the com-
municators seems on the whole to be the more plausible
explanation. The Times nev/spaper test in this case is very
aj^propriate, and is a strildng instance of what can be achieved
under favourable conditions.
Of course it is not safe to conclude that because two cases
appear similar the same methods were used in both. These
three cases seem to be connected with each other and to form
part of a programme. It is curious that any two of them
may be put in the same class from one point of view and
distinguished from the third. If they are considered together
they to some extent support each other, for a weak point in
one is a strong point in another e.g. the newspaper tests are
not so conclusive in Beard's case as in Ray's, and the incep-
tion of Strevett's case is not so satisfactory as the foundations
of Beard's and Ray's. Comparing them together one feels
that a weakness may be due to accident or lack of material
and that one cannot always expect a perfectly water-tight
structure.

CORRESPONDENCE.
FURTHER STATEMENT CONCERNING "A SUPPOSED
PREMONITORY IMPRESSION."
To the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.
Travellers' Club,
London, September, 1926.
Madam,—The letter on the case of prevision which was printed
in the Journal of July (Vol. 2.3, p. 118) does not accurately
represent the facts as known to me, and I should be obliged if you
would give nie the opportunity of nuiking the following corrections.
(1) Mr. Hobson states that I sent a telegram to warn the
manager that a fall of rock was impending. I uientioned nothing
about a fall of rock. When my telegram was sent (" to stop the
men working immediately I only knew that the men were in
great danger where they were working. I did not know what
form the danger took until next morning, when I received three
telegrams to let me know what had happened shortly after I had
sent the telegram.
Mr. Hobson implies that I knew all about quarry operations
from my boyhood. That statement is also incorrect. My father
and I lived about ten miles from the quarries, which were worked
by a local manager. My father was over forty years of age
when he first had an interest in the quarries, which he visited
from time to time to consult with the manager ; but neither my
father nor I had any technical knowledge of quarrying, and in
my early days I rarely visited the quarries. If the quarrymen
who were working on the ground, and who had known it from
childhood, and the agent, saw no indications of danger, how
should I ?
(3) When I motored back from the quarry with my brother
he told me of a "shoot" he had been to. I was interested, and
while listening to him the " message " came that the men were
in great danger and I should send a wire to the agent to tell
them to leave immediately. When I told my brother he said
there was no reason and no indication of danger ; but I persisted,
and at the next Post Office I passed I sent the wire.
138 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1926
When I received ttie three telegrams the next morning telling
me of the landslide I lay on the sofa for an hour, and the
thought uppermost in ray mind was, if I had been persuaded
not to send the telegram what a terrible result would have
followed. But I must disclaim Mr. Hobson's statement that I
warned the local manager that a fall of rock was impending.
I was only aware of some great danger.

NOTES ON PERIODICALS.
The February issue of the new German monthly periodical
Revalo Bund has a short article by Professor Schafer of Wandsbek,
which deals with some experiments recently conducted in
attempted " control " of a medium by a living person at a
distance and by arrangement. One of the results appears to be
striking, and a detailed account should be published. Two
private persons took part in the experiment, in addition to the circle
of observers. One was the daughter of a prominent local official ;
and the other an officer in the air-force. It was proposed that
attempts should be made by the officer to " control " the female
medium from a distance. The officer was told the day and hour
in which sitting? were held, and the circle awaited results. One
evening, during the sitting, a sharp rap was heard, and the
entranced medium immediately sprang up and assumed a military
bearing. She signified her desire to write, and on a paper block
which was handed to her she wrote in a changed handwriting the
words Me-'tnento inoris C. . . . A member of the circle then
announced that he had received a letter from the officer stating
his intention of being present in spirit at the evening's sitting,
and enclosing a sealed enve]o])e. On opening the envelope a piece
of paper was found on which was written the same words as the
medium hatl just written herself. It was also stated that the
writing was similar to that of the officer.
The Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research for
June has an interesting article by Dr. Crandon on certain new
features of the Margery mediumship, in which what is claimed as
examples of crypthesthesia are a prominent feature. The case is
evidently becoming of increasing importance, and recent visitors
October, 1926 Notes on Periodicals 139
of scientific distinction in other fields have been much impressed,
as one would naturally expect.
In the same issue M. Eene Sudre contributes an abstract of a
lecture recently delivered at the College de France, in which he
severely castigates the persons whose doubts concerning the
integrity of mediums and the competence of investigators lead
them to adopt an attitude of great caution in the field of psychical
research. Thus the present writer is characterised by M. Sudre
as one who has " made war against all physical mediums," which
is a grotesque travesty of the truth, and in his treatment of
Guzik M. Sudre shows that he has but little appreciation of the
nature of the evidence against that medium. The persons
chastised with so much Gallic vigour by M. Sudre ask for very
little. Many of them, the writer included, would travel many
miles to hear a few supernormal raps. The only condition they
insist upon is that these raps should not be such as may be
produced normally, and can it be said that this condition is
unreasonable ? M Sudre is continually deploring the aloof
attitude of scientific men. " We would wish," he says, " to have
a scientific audience," and all that is demanded is "a single
effort of good will." Is M. Sudre too ingenuous not to realize
that that scientific audience is patiently awaiting a demonstration
of the " facts " proclaimed by their enthusiastic sponsor, but
under conditions better than those which appear to M. Sudre so
perfect, and which he associates so often with the names of
Guzik, or Kahn ?
In the same issue Mr. Bird continues the discussion of Mrs.
Pruden's mediumship, and comes to the wise conclusion that
nothing more can be done until that lady permits the inquiry to
be conducted in such a way that obvious avenues to fraud are
at least partially closed to her.

REVIEWS.
I. " Margery " the Medium. By J. Malcolm Bird. Boston : Small*
Maynard & Co. 1925. Price $4.00.
This book is an account of the celebrated " Margery " medium-
ship from its commencement up to the date of publication. For
the benefit of those of our Members, if there are any, who are
not acquainted with the details of the case, it is worth while to
mention that Margery is the name given to Mrs. Crandon, the
wife of a well-known Boston surgeon, and that her mediumship
began, as far as this book is concerned, in 1923.
For the purposes of this review the book may be considered as
consisting of two parts, the first being an account of the various
sittings and phenomena which took place up to April, 1924, while
the second is an account of the investigation by the Committee
appointed by the Scientific American magazine to examine the
phenomena of mediums who entered for the prize offered by that
journal.
The phenomena recorded in the five hundred or so pages before
us form perhaps the most heterogeneous and confusing mass of
material that has ever been presented to the student. To attempt
any kind of summary would be hopeless. Almost every phase
of mediumship that has ever been heard of finds some example
in this extraordinary case, and the really notable fact which
emerges from the mass is that we know no more about the
causation of such phenomena or their place in a scientific scheme,
than we did when the series began. If, as the author argues,
the Margery phenomena are genuinely supernormal, this is a
lamentable confession of failure.
Various attempts seem to have been made by different investi-
gators to secure the production, under test conditions, of some
single phenomenon which could be examined in detail, but in
every case before this end was attained the inquiry went off on
to a new track, and for some reason or other the earlier attempt
fell through.
The reader will thus find, in this part of the book, an immense
number of rather disconnected accounts of alleged supernormal
events ; but it will be difficult for him to decide whether their
OCTOBEE, 1926 Reviews 141
claim to p;enuineness can be allowed, and, even if it is, they will
tell him nothing as to their mechanism.
With regard to Mr. Bird's accuracy as a reporter, the only case
in which this can be estimated by us is his account of the sitting
at the S.P.R. rooms in 1923, in which he describes Mr. " Fielding
"
as a conjurer, and the table as the celebrated trick table of Mr.
Harry Price." In point of fact Mr. Feilding is not a conjurer,
and the table is in no sense a trick table and was not designed
by Mr. Price.
What I have called the second part of the book is an account
of the investigation by the Scientific American committee, of which
Mr. Bird was secretary from its formation until the close of the
Margery enquiry, and it is clearly as a criticism of this Committee,
and as a reply to its adverse report that the book was largely
written. On this side of the Atlantic it is difficult to form any
opinion as to the rights or wrongs of this dispute. What is
abundantly clear from Mr. Bird's account is, that the Committee
was not a sufficiently united body for the task they had under-
taken. The members of it had a tendency to pursue their own
lines of inquiry, and to formulate their conclusions without a
sufficiently frank attitude towards one another. This was probably
an inevitable consequence of the constitution of the Committee,
but the fact rendered any satisfactory conclusion impossible.
From the present position of the Margery problem as it is
presented in this book it is perhaps possible to draw two con-
clusions. First, that if any progress is to be made it will only be
by insisting on the continual repetition of one phenomenon, until
by varying the conditions, some definite knowledge is gained as
to the nature of the forces at work and their modus operandi.
Second, that the group of investigators concerned must be pre-
pared to devote a large amount of time and work to possibly
monotonous experiment, and must have complete confidence in
one another.

II. Fakirs, fumistes et Cie. By Paul Heuze. Pp. v, 211. Paris :
Les editions de France, 1926.
This little book is a discussion of the claims of certain travelling
" fakirs," such as Tahra Bey and Rahmann Bey, and their relation
142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1926
to alleged psychic phenomena. The author will be remembered as
one of the promoters of the various schemes for testing the
claims of physical mediums in Paris, and in the present volume
he applies his strongly developed critical faculty to a considera-
tion of the travelling fakirs. He shows how their phenomena
can be duplicated with a little practice and some pain by anyone,
and the wrapper shows him with hat-pins thrust through his
flesh a la Tahra Bey.

a Member of the Society, by whom the facts were originally
communicated to Mrs. Sidgwick and to Mr. J. Gr. Piddington^
It is a case of an attempt to obtain by supernormal means
information concerning the contents of a sealed packet, this
information being possessed by no living person. So far as
regards its original purpose the experiment failed, but the
result was not without interest in the fact that five persons-
independently made statements which seemed to be attempts
to describe the contents of the packet, and these statements
agreed with one another, though not with the facts. This,
suggests that some telepathic rapport may have been set up
between the various living persons concerned in the experiment,,
and for that reason the incident is worth recording. The-
names of all the persons concerned are known to the Society,
but some of them are not given here.
The experiment originated in 1918, when Mrs Benson, Mr.
E. F. Benson's mother, sealed up a packet containing something
which had belonged to her daughter, who had died two years,
before. Mrs. Benson herself died in 1918, and in 1923 Mr..
E. F. Benson wrote to Mr. Piddington as follows
:
Aug. 15.23.
... In consequence of what Mrs. Leonard said, while I was-
sitting with her, about another packet . . . my mother agreed to-
prepare Packet B (with which we have to deal). Packet B,.
which has never been opened, is in my possession. All I know of
its contents is that it contains something which belonged to my
sister, who died in 1916. The plan was that I should try to
ascertain from some medium what Packet B contained. Up till
the time of my mother's death in 1918 I had not done so. As
far as I know, therefore, nobody alive has any knowledge of
what Packet B contains. (i) After my mother's death I told
Mrs. A [a personal friend of Mrs. Benson's, see below] the
November, 1926 Case
story of Packet B, which was then unknown to her. She sat
with a friend of hers who does automatic script, and in the
script there came out the information of what the packet con-
tained. I do not know what that information was, because I
refused to let Mrs. A tell me. . . .
E. F. Bensok.
The later part of Mr. Benson's letter to Mr. Piddington is
concerned with matters which are told in greater detail in a
subsequent letter to Mrs. Sidgwick (see below).
The next development in the case occurred in June of this
year, when Mr. Benson wrote to Mrs. Sidgwick, thus :
June 23.26.
I enclose a half sheet which may perhaps interest you. . . .
I intend now to open the packet in question, because I don't
see how, as a test, the conditions could be improved. For the
last eight years, nobody, as far as I know, can have known what
is in the packet, and if it does contain a lock of hair, or, say,
the picture of a lock of hair, or anything of the sort, it is diffi-
cult to see from where, except from some disearnate source, the
information could have come. . . .
E. E. Benson.
With this letter was enclosed the following statement
:
The substance of this was written on June 17th, 1926, and
copied out with two small corrections on June 22nd.
Some months before my mother's death in 1918 she sealed up
a packet the contents of which, so far as I know, are unknown
to any one Hving on this earth, and sent it to me with a view
to my seeing if any medium could, without handbng the packet,
tell me what was inside it. I could not find a suitable oppor-
tunity before her death, and the packet, still unopened, is in a
drawer of the table in the front ground-floor at 25 Brompton
Square.
After my mother's death I told Mrs. A of the existence of
the packet, and she consulted three mediums separately who,
purporting to be in communication with my mother, told her
what the packet contained. They none of them saw or handled
or were in any way put into connexion with it, but they all
three said it contained the same thing. Mrs. A did not tell
146 Journal of Society /w Psychical MeseaTch November, 1926
me what this was, but wrote it down and gave it me in a sealed
envelope. The idea was that I should independently consult a
medium, and therefore had better not know what the others had
said. When two of the mediums had given the same answer,
but before the third had been consulted, I sat with Mrs. Cooper
of the British College of Psychic Science. She professed to learn
the contents of the packet (which she said was a flower), but when
I -bold Mrs. A this, it did not agree with what had been told her.
Last week, on June 9th, Mrs. A brought here a fresh medium
Mrs. [Barnes] (pseud.). She went into trance, and speaking with
great difficulty called me " her son Fred." She then pulled down
a piece of her hair, and wrapped it round her fingers : she
repeated this action twice or three times. On coming to herself
she seemed to have no idea what had happened, and before
going into trance had not known that she was being consulted
about the packet in question. Mrs. A , as the medium was
coming out of trance, told me for the first time what the other
mediums had said, namely that the packet contained a lock of
hair. Mrs. A
—
— confirms the correctness of this account.
E. F. Benson.
In reply to some questions put by Mrs. Sidgwick, Mr.
Benson \vrote to her again a few days later, as follows :
June 2Sth, 26.
. . . With regard to your first letter (special features), the
questions you ask can mostly be only answered by Mrs A .
I will put them all to her, and get her answers written down
before the packet is opened. There are, however, a few which
concern me. (1) The drawer in which the packet has been kept
was not locked. . . .
E. F. Benson.
In tlie rest of this letter and in a letter written on July 1st,
Mr. Benson discusses what bearing this fact could have on
the experiment. The conclusion lie reaches is that it may be
regarded as certain that the contents of the packet had not
become known to any one. In view of the result of the
experiment this part of the evidence does not seem worth
recording in detail. Mr. Benson also sent Mrs. Sidgwick a
statement concerning Mrs. A 's replies to questions put to
her, as follows :
November, 1926 Case 147
Questions asked Mrs. A hy E. F. B. before the opening of
the packet, and her anstvers.
(1) Did ]\Irs. A know where the packet was kept ?
Ansiver. No.
(2) About what date did E. F. B. mention the existence of it
to her ?
Answer. About 1921.
(3) What were the names of the mediums who gave the identical
solution of the contents of the packet ?
Ansiver. (i) Mrs. C . She gave it in automatic script in 1921.
(ii) Mrs. J . She gave it in trance in 1921 or 1922.
(iii) Name of third doubtful. She gave it in trance
about the same time.
(iv) Mrs. [Cross]. She was not in trance, but said she
saw my mother, describing her correctly, stand-
ing by Mrs. A , and holding a lock of hair.
Date, 1926.
(Finally Mrs. [Barnes] said nothing about a packet, but in trance
at Lamb House, Rye, in June, 1926, wound my finger in her
hair. Nothing was said to her in my presence about my mother.)
(4) Did any of the mediums know before the sitting that they
were to be asked about a sealed packet ?
Answer. No. The information concerning a lock of hair
occurred spontaneously, whether the medium was in trance or
not. Mrs. C signed the message as coming from my mother.
(5) Did any who spoke in trance appear to have any subsequent
knowledge of what they had said ?
Answer. No.
(6) Did Mrs. A tell them what had happened, or mention
E. F. B. or his mother ?
Ansiver. No.
(7) Did Mrs. A think that any of the mediums were
acquainted ?
Answer. To the best of her knowledge they were not.
After the opening of the sealed packet Mr. Benson ^^Tote
to Mrs. Sidgwick as follows :
j^j^ ri
9q
The test was a complete failure, for the packet contained a
lacquer box, and inside it was a small silver cross and a piece of
a necklace of Egyptian beads ... E. F. Benson.
148 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November, 1926
As observed in Mr. Benson's letter the test was a failure,
so far as concerns the attempt to obtain information not
possessed by any living mind, and the interest of the case
lies in the circumstance that five people independently made
the same suggestion in regard to the contents of the sealed
packet. The force of this coincidence is diminished by the
fact that the suggestion as to a lock of hair was a fairly
obvious one. On the other hand, there are other obvious
suggestions, e.g. the one made by Mrs. Cooper, that the packet
contained a flower, and it does not seem likely that chance
alone would lead as man}^ as five people along the same road.
The fact that on all the occasions when a lock of hair was
mentioned Mrs. A was present, and that on the one occasion
when she was not present, the sitting mth Mrs. Cooper, a
different solution was offered, suggests that telepathy from Mrs.
A may have played some part in the result obtained.
THE S.P.E. SERIES OF SITTINGS WITH
MR. GEORGE VALIANTINE.
Reply by Mr. H. Dennis Bradley to Mr. Hereward
Carrington, and Una, Lady Troubridge.
I have read Mr. Hereward Carrington's letter in the issue of the
Journal of the S.P.R. for June, in reference to the Vahantine
sittings. I have also read the reply by Una, Lady Troubridge.
Mr. Hereward Carrington naturally endeavours to defend his
position as a member of the Scientific American Committee.
The findings of that Committee, published in their Report of
July 1923, upon the three sittings held ^vith George Valiantine,
were based upon a determined assumption of fraud. My analysis
of this Report in Towards the Stars was scientifically critical,
and those findings were proved to be illogical and groundless.
During 1925 a further series of sixty-one experiments took
place under the mediumship of Valiantine. These sittings were
attended by one hundred and twenty-two persons. This series,
at which luminous trumpets were mtroduced, was even more
successful and evidential than that of 1924. The complete details
l^ovEMBEK, 1926 Sittings with Mr. George Valiantine 149
are published in The Wisdom of the Gods, whicli Mr. Carrington
does not appear to have read.
In his comments on Lady Troubridge's report of the Valiantine
sittings Mr. Carrington says :
" It is unfortunate therefore, that
on the only occasion when she thought she heard the medium's
voice at the same time as the '
independent voice,' other sitters
in the circle failed to do so. . .
."
This is inaccurate. Simultaneous voices were heard not only
by Una, Lady Troubridge, but by Mrs. Bradley, by myself and
by Mr. Hannen Swafier, and, on a subsequent occasion, at that
same sitting, when the two voices were again heard speaking
simultaneously, every sitter in the circle heard it. (See p. 298 of
The Wisdom of the Gods.)
Mr. Carrington's naive blundering reaches its height in his .
primitive explanation of the methods by which the medium is
supposed (by him) to produce the voices. He gives a series of
curious manoeuvres which a fraudulent medium is supposed to
perform with the trumpet, adding, mysteriously and significantly,
in the dark," and ignorant that in the Valiantine sittings two
luminous trumpets were used, and that these manoeuvres were
impossible without instant detection.
Mr. Carrington is incorrect in his statement of the conditions
of the Valiantine tests. Nor are his mis-statements confined to
-one aspect of the case. Even Una, Lady Troubridge, finds it
necessary to repudiate some of his suggestions. (P. 90, Journal
.S.P.R., June 1926.)
Mr. Carrington would seem to have a high opinion of his own
powers as a fraudulent medium, and boasts of his performance
in the light, performances as to the possibility of which, however,
Lady Troubridge would appear to be dubious. He is apparently
ignorant of the conditions of these daylight sittings. Far be it
from me to question Mr. Carrington' s powers of imposition, but
I may be permitted to doubt his capacity for carrying on intelli-
gent conversations in half a dozen languages, under any con-
ditions, light or dark.
It is impossible to understand the attitude now taken by Lady
Troubridge, in view of the report she gave in the Proceedings
of the S.P.R., and in view of the many statements which she
made before witnesses during the series of the Valiantine sittings.
150 Journal of Society for Fsijchiccd Re^eavclt Novembeh, 1926
Lady Troubridge now says (June 1926), " I agree with almost
everything Mr. Carrington says/' This is tantamount to saying
that she agrees with the assumption of Mr. Carrington " that
Valiantine's phenomena are easily explicable, and that fraud
alone will serve to account for all the alleged manifestations-
produced through his '
mediumship."
"
How is it possible for Lady Troubridge to reconcile this assump-
tion with her report of January 1926 (Part 97, Proc. S.P.R.,.
page 55) :
" We think it only fair to Valiantine to say that,
apart from any evidential value lying in the utterances of the-
voices, we feel that the total phenomena produced at this sitting
were beyond what could have been obtained by the fraudulent
efforts of the medium unaided by any accomplice 1
Lady Troubridge now refers to " the conditions imposed by Mr-
Bradley—total darkness, no control of the medium, and a general
atmosphere of antagonism to any test being required."
It is remarkable that she should now make such an objection,,
since the entire object of these sittings was to obtain mental
evidence, and the question of controlling the medium was never-
raised. The sittings were not held in total darkness, since the
two luminous trumpets or megaphones were brightly luminous,,
and were both clearly discernible, so that every movement and
every angle could be observed by all the sitters.
Lady Troubridge's present objections are in entire contradiction.'
of the facts of the case.
On Thursday, March 13th, 1925, Lady Troubridge and Miss
Radclyffe-Hall had their first sitting at Dorincourt, under-
Valiantine's mediumship.
On this occasion Valiantine was not introduced to either Ladjr
Troubridge or Miss Radclyfie-Hall. nor did he see their faces until
we walked into the study, when the lights were switched off
after a few seconds.
During the sitting three different " voices " came through,
giving their Christian names and surnames, and speaking to both
Lady Troubridge and Miss Radclyffe-Hall. Lady Troubridge
asked one of the spirit voices to give through the name of her
daughter ; the name was volunteered by the voice, a most un-
usual name as Lady Troubridge herself states.
In her letter of June 1926 Lady Troubridge states :
" Mr„
November, 1926 Sittings with Mr. George Valiantine 151
Bradley introduces his sitters by name ; in many cases there are
preliminary dinner-parties at which the medium is introduced to
all the company, and is able, should he wish it, to glean such
information as Mr. Bradley and his household may have failed
to supply." This statement is entirely untrue. At the great
majority of the Valiantine series of sittings none of the sitters
was introduced to Valiantine. It was only on a few occasions
with guests who were staying in my house during week-ends,
when it Avas impossible to avoid introductions, that this method
was adopted.' On each of these occasions I have been careful,
to state, in my book, that the sitters were introduced.
I have used meticulous care in recording faithfidly every in-
cident, and I resent the innuendo made by Lady Troubridge in
her statement that " Valiantine's position as a guest in the house-
hold, including Mr. and Mrs. Bradley, their son and servants,
and a younger son of eight years old, offers unlimited oppor-
tunities for the acquisition of useful data anent prospective
sitters."
On Monday, March 16th, 1925, Lady Troubridge and Miss
Radclyffe-Hall again sat at Dorincourt under the mediumship of
Valiantine. Dr. Woolley was also present. On this occasion,
three different spirit voices again spoke to Lady Troubridge and
Miss Radclyffe-Hall, each voice announcing itself by name.
At the time when Valiantine was speaking simultaneously with
Dr. Barnett, and the two voices were heard by all speaking to-
gether, Lady Troubridge immediately volunteered the statement :
" I wish to state that the medium was speaking at the same time
as Dr. Barnett." (See Proc, Part 97, p. 61.)
The sitting which took place at 6.30 p.m. at Dorincourt on
March 21st, 1925, was a negative one. A mistake was made
with regard to a " Feda " communication in reference to Miss
Walker. It was far more my mistake than that of the com-
municant, and, quoting from Lady Troubridge's Report of this
sitting (p. 64-75, Part 97, Proc. of the S.P.R.), the voice of " Feda "
said :
" Raymond is here and wants to speak with Miss Walker,"
and, again, " Raymond has come to give a message to Miss
Walker." Later :
" Raymond is here and he wanted to speak
to Miss Walker." Both the voice of " Feda " and the voice of
" Dr. Barnett " said that the mistake was ours and that the circle-,
had misunderstood.
152 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November. 1926
After this incident ""
Feda " continued talking to me for some
two or three minutes ;
impressing upon me and insisting that she
.had not made a mistake.
Some few weeks after this sitting Lady Troubridge informed me,
at a P.B.N. Club Dinner (I believe the date was April 7th),
that at a sitting with Mrs. Osborne Leonard Feda " told her
that she had not made a mistake on the evening in question.
Lady Troubridge then told " Feda " that " rather than there
-should he any possibility of a mistake being made it ivould be
better if Feda did not endeavour to get through at these voice seances
again.
Hoiv does Lady Troubridge account for this obvious instance of
cross-confirmation of evidence of identity obtained through the tivo
dijferent meditims—George Yaliantine and Mrs. Osborne Leonard ?
Lady Troubridge states that at the Valiantine sittings, Feda,
in the direct voice, speaks with a Yankee accent and vocabulary.
" Feda " does not talk with a Yankee accent. She speaks with
a peculiar accent, which is definitely characteristic, and which
never varies. Lady Troubridge has never heard " Feda " speak
in the direct voice.
Lady Troubridge has ofiered the opinion that it was quite
possible it was not " Feda " at all—and that it might, be an
entity impersonating " Feda." This contention cannot possibly
be accepted, as " Feda " has been through on dozens of occasions,
speaking in a characteristic manner, both at the Valiantine
sittings and at the " direct [voice " sittings held under my own
and my wife's mediumship. She has an unmistakable personality,
and, in addition to this, I have a remarkable accumulation of
-cross evidence through Feda " in the direct voice, confirmed by
sittings with Mrs. Osborne Leonard when " Feda " has spoken
through Mrs. Leonard in her trance condition. Mrs. Osborne
Leonard herself has spoken with Feda at length at the direct
voice seances held at Dorincourt. We all know Feda " and
•every intonation of her voice.
During this series of Valiantine sittings both Lady Troubridge
and Miss Radclyfie-Hall received several evidential utterances
given to them in the direct voice of communicants known to them.
I would particularly refer to pp. 57-58 of Lady Troubridge's
Eeport {Proc, Part 97).
-November, 1926 Sittings loith Mr. George Valiantiiie 153
Many other evidential communications are also to be found in
Lady Troubridge's report. In her letter of June 1926 Lady
Troubridge ignores these, and refers only to what she now, for
the first time, calls " definite mistakes." These " mistakes " on
analysis, prove to be :
(1) Mrs. Eastman (pseudonym), expressing afiection for her.
(Lady Troubridge.)
This however, is quite a usual occurrence at " direct voice
"
.sittings, when personal spirits address sitters when known to them.
(2) Alfred Henvood (pseudonym), claiming acquaintance with Miss
E,adclyffe-Hall.
The voice of Alfred Henvood did not claim to have known Miss
Radclyfie-Hall [in life, but it is perfectly logical and, indeed,
•obviously true, for him to claim her acquaintance at this sitting.
(3)
' Our (Lady Troubridge and Miss Radclyffe-Hall) being still
.at Sterling Street."
This occurred at a daylight sitting {Proc. S.P.R., Part 97,
p. 71) when, according to Lady Troubridge's own report, which
I quote :
" The voice said :
'
I wish X. . . . (her daughter) would come
here,' and ' sent love to her." It added that the
speaker was comiug home with me and had often been
with me in Sterling Street."
It must be noted carefully that the voice did not, according
to Lady Troubridge, say anything whatever about her and Miss
Eadclyfie-Hall being still at Sterling Street. According to Lady
Troubridge's report the voice said she had often been there.
Since Mrs. Eastman's daughter had \-isited Lady Troubridge at
Sterling Street, after her mother's death, there is no mistake
whatever, that the voice of Mrs. Eastman made such a statement,
and it may be indeed taken as an evidential utterance.
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
The attitude adopted by Lady Troubridge in her letter of
June 1926, published fifteen months after the incident occurred,
is curiously contradictory to the attitude adopted by her during
these sittings ; in her Report of January 1926, and in all the
-Statements she made before witnesses at the time.
Lady Troubridge concludes her present letter by saying : "To
sum up ; the obvious and flagrant inaccuracies contained in the
utterances, which put them entirely out of the court " as
154 Journal of Society for PsycJdcal Research November, 1926
genuine psychic communications, justify the deepest suspicion
regarding the means employed in their production."
It is inconceivable that Lady Troubridge should now make
such a grave assertion, after having said on March 23rd, 1925,
in the presence of witnesses, " I consider this establishes Valian-
tine in an exceptional way." Which statement does Lady Trou-
bridge wish us to believe ?
Mr. Carrington appears not to have troubled to read the
evidences of the various daylight sittings held under the medium-
ship of Mr. Valiantine, full details of which were published in
various chapters of The }¥isdom of the Gods. At all of these
Valiantine was under complete observation. Remarkable evidence
was given to various of the sitters by spirit voices.
Upon Mr. Carrington's assumptions, apart from the extra-
ordinary physical phenomena, Valiantine would have to possess
the ability to speak in cultured French, German, Italian, Spanish,
Russian, the Swiss and Basque dialects, Japanese, Chinese, and
idiomatic Welsh. In addition, he would also have had to acquire,,
by some inconceivable means, innumerable intimate private details,
of various personal spirits who have spoken to between two and
three hundred difierent people during the series of sittings re-
corded in my books. He would also have to be able to speak
with fluency and knowledge upon art, literature, science, medicine
and philosophy. In addition to being a genius iu learning, he
would also be the finest actor the Avorlcl has ever seen. He
would have to impersonate all types of characters, men, women
and children, and, additionally, he would need to be, on the
physical side, a brilliant conjuror and a super-human acrobat.
Further Reply by Dr. Carrington and Lady Troubridge
A word or two in reply to Mr. Bradley, concerning those parts
of his paper which refer to myself. I do not agree that Mr.
Bradley's criticism of the findings of the " Scientific American
"
Committee were in any way final or conclusive. On the contrary,
I think that Mr. Bird's replies to Mr. Bradley were quite con-
clusive, and showed Mr. Bradley to be wrong. {Journal, Amer.
S.P.R.)
I cannot agree with Mr. Bradley in thinking that a dark
^^ovEMBEE, 1926 Sittings tuitJi Mr. George Valiantine 155
seance is not a dark seance merely because the trumpets used are
illuminated! Nor have I ever heard this argument advanced
before. The illumination would merely show the movements of
the trumpets, and not the movements of the medium. Whether
the trumpets were moved by some supernormal force, or by the
muscles of the medium, would still remain the problem to be
solved.
May I finally assure Mr. Bradley that I am in no way opposed
to the possibility of Valiantine's genuine phenomena, and am
perfectly ready to change my opinion concerning him whenever
-sufficiently conclusive evidence is forthcoming ? Such evidence
ias not, however, I feel, as yet been furnished.
Hereward Carrington.
Having read Mr. Dennis Bradley's statement in the November
Journal, I find that we are at variance on so many points as
regards what happened at those Valiantine sittings which I
attended, and also regarding what I said or did not say at various
times to Mr. Bradley, or in his hearing, that I do not feel justified
in claiming space in the Journal for a further discussion of the
matter. As to whether my memory and observation or those
of Mr. Bradley, are most reliable, that must remain purely a
matter of personal opinion, since we both adhere with equal
determination to totally different accounts of the same occur-
rences. I imagine that those who know us both will form their
judgment upon the evidence we have given on former occasions
of cool and impartial mentality.
There is, however, one statement made by Mr. Bradley on
page 152, which in justice to Mrs. Osborne Leonard and her Con-
trol Feda, I must contradict : Mr. Bradley quotes me as having
informed him that Feda had told me that she had not made
a mistake" on the evening of the Valiantine sitting when a
purporting Feda made a very gxave mistake. What Feda told
me\t Mrs. Leonard's and what I repeated to Mr. Bradley, was
that she had not spoken at all during the Valiantine sitting in
question.
I confess I cannot see that this constitutes any cross-con-
firmation of evidence of identity "—if it suggests anything at
all, it suggests that there was something very wrong with a
-voice sitting that produced a "Feda" voice disclaimed by the
156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November, 192&
entity to wliom it was supposed to belong, and a voice wliicli
as I stated before, bore no resemblance at all to that of Mrs.,
Leonard's Control. Had Mr. Bradley not been a prey throughout
that sitting to the most violent emotions of excitement, distress-
and indignation, I feel sure that his impressions would have-
confirmed my own.

NOTES ON PERIODICALS.
The Zeitschnft fur Parapsychologie for July has the continuation,
of Mr. Krall's experimental study of involuntary whispering. The
experiments seem to have been ingeniously conceived and well
executed, and we hope that the articles will be reprinted in
pamphlet form. Dr. Voss contributes a short paper on some
personal experiments in clairvoyance, and Dr. Barthel has a note-
upon the problem of telekinesis.
The issue for August has a paper by Professor Messer of Giessen
on his experiences with Frau Silbert of Graz. The sittings have
no evidential value ; and although Professor Messer prints the
accounts of the touches " he receives in italics, it is difficult to
understand what importance he attaches to them since the medium's
feet remained uncontrolled beneath the table.
The September number of the same periodical has an account
by Dr. Von Schrenck-Notzing of the new electrical method of
control derived by Mr. Karl Krall for investigating physical
mediums, and employed in Munich by Dr. von Schrenck during
sittings with Willi Schneider. The device consists in a circuit of
four lamps, the current for which passes through the medium and
controller by means of metal contacts on hands and feet. If
control is relaxed the circuit is broken and one or more lights
go out, thus revealing where the loss of control has occurred.
The Zeitsclmft filr kritischen Okhultismus (Bd. L, Heft 4), has
a long article by Dr. Schulte on methods of control in dark
sittings, in which he illustrates his points by referring to the
number of sources of error made plain by the ordinary experi-
mental procedure of normal psychological investigation.

the recent exposure of the photographic medium, George Moss,,
regarded as an example of the worthlessness of observations by
untrained experimenters, whilst Count Klinckowstroem concludes-
his survey of cases of telepathy in the earlier literature. Count
Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo publishes a note upon some hitherto,
almost unknown experiments with the medium Slade that Aksakoff
had in Kussia just after the medium's triumphs with the Zollner
group. Finally, Count Klinckowstroem reviews the recent reports
of the S.P.K. on the mediums W. Schneider and J. Pronczek.
The American Journal of Psychology for July has a characteristic-
paper by Dr. Walter Prince on the Margery Case. It takes
[
the form of a review of the published literature up to the end of
: - 192-5. The article is clearly negative, and in substance is a
;
defence of the investigators who have failed to be convinced of
i
the reality of Margery's claims. An attack is also made upon
f the various publications in favour of the medium, and extracts-

are selected in order to show the various changes,'" " omissions

and "subtractions.'' Dr. Prince lays much stress upon the " con-
ditions" which hampered the work of the Scientific American
Committee, although he does not explain why the Committee accepted
them. Similarly he complains that "Dr. Crandon was beside-
Margery in 109* out of the 112 sittings of the Scientific American
period," whilst omitting to mention the highly important fact
that the link between Dr. Crandon and Margery was often con-
trolled by the committee's own observer.^

tics concerning this question, but the condition of the committee-s records-
renders accuracy apparently impossible. Dr. Crandon (letter dated July
30, 1926), writes that " the link between Margery and myself was controlled
at every sitting for the Scientihc American Committee, except for red hght
phenomena where it is not necessary " : Mr. Bird says (letter of Aug. 4.
1926), that in forty sittings the link was controlled, and Dr. Prince (letter-
of July 31, 1926), states that the link was oontroUed in about 36 sittmgs.
It appears to be uncertain how many official sittings the Committee held, and.
thus confusion arose which now it is impossible to reduce to order.
The Occult Review for September has an article by Mr. Fortune-
on evidence and proof in occult science. The writer is aware
that the present position is unsatisfactory, and admits that the
nature of proof available concerning the '-Inner Planes" differs,
from that available for natural science. E. J. D.

CORRESPONDENCE.
Concerning Psychic "Light."
To the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.
Madam,—Witli regard to Miss Gertrude jTubby's letter in the
May Journal (Vol. XXIII. pp. 81, 82), regarding psychic " light,"' it
is interesting to consider the question of the " light which seems
to play such an important part in mediumistic phenomena, in
connection with the light which it seems to me, from my own
experience and from what I have read, illuminates the normal
dream field.
{a) Very often when on the point of dropping asleep and dream
imagery is beginning to manifest itself, I have been conscious, on
being roused to consciousness by a noise, of the sudden disappear-
:ance of light. The light is not caused by the noise or disturbance :
I am vividly conscious on waking that the vague inchoate begin-
nings of dreams have been associated with this light which
vanishes in a flash, with the dreams. In Miss Tubby's words?
" the light disappears when the consciousness becomes aware of
it." It seems probable that these lights (the normal-dream and
the mediumistic) only differ quantitatively !
(&) Some months ago you published a letter from me regarding
the " left-handedness " of my visionary impressions, in connection
-with my left-handedness.^ I venture to recall this in connection
with the letter under discussion. But I am surprised to note
that the supernormal light eiiects observed with the right-handed
medium, Mrs. Sanders, were massed on the same side as the
right lobe of the brain : surely right-handedness is due to the domi-
nation of the left lobe ?

OBITUARY NOTICE.
Professor W. Romaine Newbold.
News which has only now (November 6th) reached us of the
sudden death on September 26th, at the age of 61, of our
Corresponding Member, Professor William Romaine Newbold,
of Philadelphia, is sad news to all who knew him. And
old members of our Society and those who have read back
numbers of Proceedings, especially in connexion with Mrs.
Piper's mediumship, will realise what a valuable member he
has been. He has carried out original investigations and pub-
lished reports of them in Proceedings, and he has also written
criticisms and useful reviews. It is true that of late years he
has not done much scientific work in Psychical Research, and
he told me in a letter received two years ago, that he did not
expect to do any in the future, partly because of the demands
made on his time by the students in his classes, and partly
because he had become absorbed in the study of Christian
and pagan thoughts in the first three centuries of our era.
" But," he added, "I am none the less interested, and I try
to keep in touch with the work and to gain members for the
162 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Decembek, 1926
Society wtenever opportunity ofiers." Certainly he was one
of the kindest of Corresponding Members, ready to take
trouble, and help in any way he could.
Professor Newbold tells us in Proceedings, Vol. XIV. p. 11,
that he first became interested in Psychical Research in the
winter of 1890-1891, as a result of reading the report of
sittings held with Mrs. Piper during her first visit to England,
published in Vol. VI. of Proceedings. This led to his arrang-
ing for sittings with Mrs. Piper, of which he had a large num-
ber between 1891 and 1895, reported on in a paper published by
him in Proceedings, Vol. XIV., as a first instalment of Hodg-
son's projected sequel to his report in Vol. XIII. Professor
Newbold did not know Dr. Hodgson when his own investiga-
tions into the subject began, but they afterwards became
intimate friends ; and sittings he had with Mrs. Piper after
Dr. Hodgson's death in 1905, with a view to getting, if possible,
into communication with him, form an interesting part of
Professor William James's " Report on Mrs. Piper's Hodgson-
Control " published in Proceedings, Vol. XXIII.
I met Professor Newbold for the first and, I think, only
time at the International Congress of Experimental Psychology
held in Loudon in 1892. I do not know whether it was his
general interest in Psj^chology or his special interest in Psychi-
cal Research that led him to attend the Congress, but Psychi-
cal Research was rather prominent at that Congress, and a
desire to meet those responsible for the report on Mrs. Piper,
which had interested him, may well have been an important
attraction. It was in the autumn of that year that he first
joined the S.P.R.—as an Associate of the American Branch-
-
and not till more than ten years later (1903) that he became
a Corresponding Member.
Though my acquaintance with Professor Newbold was in
fact slight, for our letters were infrequent, I knew him well
enough to realise that he was an unusually sympathetic man,
and am not surprised to learn that he was extremely popular
with his pupils. He had been a lecturer at the University
of Pennsylvania since 1889 and a Professor there since 1903.

December, 1926 Case 163
L. 1275. CASE.
A Book-Test.
We print below a report on a book-test obtained at a sitting
with Mrs. Leonard, taken by Mrs. Hugh Meredith. '
The
report of the case came to us through Mrs. Sydney Leaning, a
Member of this Society, to whom Mrs. Meredith is personally
known, and who, when sending the report of the case, wrote
to Mrs. Salter, the Editor, as follows :
Elmstead,
Epsom Lane, Tadworth,
August 8th, 1926.
I have to-day, while reading the Leonard Sittings Eeport in
our latest Proceedings, received from the writer, Mrs. Meredith,
the enclosed report. I had heard of her sitting and its results
and thought it very good, and asked if she would write me an
account which I could forward to our Journal. She brought it
over herself, from Walton-on-the-Hill, and I have seen (a) her
original notes, taken at the sitting, (b) her friend Miss Parry's
corroborating letter. She assures me that she has no objection
at all to her actual name being used, nor has Miss Parry, whom
she asked on Friday about it. . . .
F. E. Leaning.
It will be seen that this book-test differs from most of
those obtained through Mrs. Leonard in that it contains a
definitely experimental element, the experiment being designed
to test whether any supernormal knowledge was shown not so
much of the book in itself as of the thoughts of a person
who had lately read it.. We print first an explanatory
statement from Mrs. Meredith concerning various relevant
facts, and especially concerning the circumstances which led
up to the experiment.
Statement by Mrs. Meredith.
On March 2.5th, 1926, I had a letter from Mrs. Leonard saying
that a friend who was to have a sitting with her on Friday, 26th,
was unable to keep the appointment, but had written to her
164 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Deoembkk, 1926
suggesting that I might like to come instead. I wrote at once,
gratefully accepting the offer.
That evening, March 25th, I met in town Miss A. L. Parry,
a friend who had lived with me for nearly four years in Australia,
and as we sat at dinner I told her of my good fortune in getting
another sitting with Mrs. Leonard, and said that I should like
if possible to get some simple test through.
We are rather ignorant of such matters, but decided that when
she went home she should read some special book in bed last
thing at night and that I should ask the name of it at the
sitting. She was to decide on the book after she left me so
that I might be quite in the dark about it.
Then after she knew my sitting with Mrs. Leonard was over,
she was to write and tell me what book she had read.
She was living at Southfields and I was at Walton-on-the-Hill.
On Friday, 26th, I had my sitting and took very copious notes
which rather troubled my communicators, but Feda kept holding
them back very kindly so that I might get my record.
On Saturday, 27th, I read the full account aloud to a cousin
who had come up to spend the day with me. Neither of us
could make any sense out of the notes relating to the book-test,
except that with regard to what Feda had said about " light
"
I half expected the book chosen to be '
The Light that Failed,'
as I knew my friend Miss Parry had just bought a complete set
of Kipling.
For the sake of clearness, before giving particulars of the sitting,
I must mention a few facts about those concerned.
My husband, Hugh Meredith, and I were married and went to
Burma in 1916. In February, 1918, he had to retire owing to
ill-health. We went to Australia to seek a better climate for his
lung trouble. I got a post at Frensham, Mittagong, a school in
the Southern Heights of New South Wales, and after six months
in a Sanatorium in the Blue Mountains, he came and joined me in
the Southern Heights and I went on with my teaching. We were
then very happy and very hopeful in our cottage in '
The Holt.'
However, in April, 1919, we were ordered out West for the
winter, and when the hot weather came we decided to have a
home of our own in the Blue Mountains.
To this house my friend Miss Parry came for the first time,
and for her first visit to Australia in the November of 1920.
Decembee, 1926 Case 165
And here my husband died on April 7th, 1924, while Miss
Parry was still with us. When he died, a friend who had lost
her husband in similar circumstances wrote me these few lines
from '
The Disciples '
by Eleanor Hamilton King
:
And often mused
On the strange fate that had elected me
To live so close to heroes, and to share
Such noble things, and in their hour of need
To be obedient to them—and to serve
Him whom I loved the best of all the world.
'
The Disciples '
had no significance for us before my husband
died, though I had a copy in my possession.
Extracts from Mrs. Meredith's original notes of her sitting with
Mrs. Leonard, March mh, 1926.
Feda. Did she (A.L.P.) think of ttvo books ? I feel as if she
was thinking of another book too. (Note 1.)
Can't always read the books. They don't often read
words, they get the sense. But the book she read
Suggests travelling, and a lot of places, covering a lot
of ground, not a book of a few places, but a book
touching (especially in the beginning) on many places.
(Note 2.)
Something about Light at the beginning. Light
comes in rather 'portantly in this book. (Note 3.)
He smiles and says, " If you [A.H.M.] open that
book, you know the flies pages [Feda's way of saying
" fly-leaves "] ? There's something on one of those
pages which signifies the survival, the continuity of
Life," and also, he can't see the words, but gets the
idea of Light. (Note 4.)
Could you look early in the book and see if it
describes a place that you and he have been in
together, here on earth ? He says he wants to ex-
plain he's not sure it's really the place you were at,
but it would fit the place you were at. He says,
" A place we were happy at, one of the most hopeful
places, and where we had perhaps a happier condition
than ever after or before." He's very interested and
hopes you'll be able to place it.
166 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December, 1926
Notes hy Mrs. Meredith.
1. Letter from A.L.P., written on March 29th, 1926. " The
book I read in bed was '
The Disciples.' 1 had thought of reading
Forbes Robinson's '
Letters to his Friends,' but I thought perhaps
Feda might not manage the '
r.'s.'
"
2. '
The Disciples,' being all about Garibaldi and describing the
journeyings of his small band of disciples, is essentially " a book
touching on many places." The end is mainly set in Rome.
3. See many passages in Overture culminating on p. 25 (edition
in Dryden Library) with these lines :
Love that showed
First the true stars of heaven to light the road.
And make it straight unto Eternity
With aim of all Progressive Life to Thee,
0 Father, 0 Divine, Whom, darkened so
By priests and tyrannies we could not know.
... ... and the morning broke
... ... and the keen rays
In simple splendour light the land of dawn
And the day cometh.
4. Letter from A.L.P., March 29th. " The only things on the
fly-leaves, beyond the printers' names, are " her name and greeting
from the friend who gave the book.
But in my (A.H.M.'s) copy of '
The Disciples ' there is a list
of the Volumes in the Dryden Library, and among them (1)
'
The Song Celestial,' (2)
'
The Light of Asia.'
5. There are 288 pages in the book ; on p. 41 occurs :
And one day
About midday (a), we halted by a lake,
A small lake (6) in the hollow of the hills (c).
Amidst the blue and yellow water-flags (d and e)
Where many herons were wading. And we lay
And rested in the shadow of the pines (g) .
Upon the sandy shore (h).
(1) I didn't know this passage before, but it would describe the
spot in Frensham Holt, Mittagong, N.S.W., where a party of us
had lunch (a) on Christmas Day, 1918, under the pines (g) and
by the round pool (b) in the creek {h), fringed by irises or water-
December, 1926 Case 167
flags {d). The iris is the school 'flower and is on all hat-bands
and other badges (e). Mittagong is 2000 feet high and surrounded
by higher hills, so the small lake is in a hollow of the hills.
(2) A few days before the sitting my Album, containing the
signatures of all this Christmas party, was returned to me.
(3) Certainly we were happier and more hopeful at Frensham
than ever after or before.
(4) A.L.P. was not at this " party." She came to Australia
for the first time two years later. She visited Frensham in Feb-
ruary, 1924.
AiLEEN H. Meredith.
Aurjuft 7th, 1926.
Mrs. Meredith has sent us a note concerning a further
incident which occurred at her sitting of March 26th, 1926,
which, as she says, " is not exactly part of the book-test, but
might be of interest.
Extracts from Notes of Sitting with Mrs. Leonard.
TedA. He says :
" You looked at a picture, not in our
house, which reminded you of Australia. You have
forgotten now, but it will come back."
Notes by Mrs. Meredith.
(1) At the Sargent Exhibition I saw a picture of '
In a Church
at P.' It belonged to Lord Lascelles and shews a statue of a
saint in a niche. The face of the saint was just the face of my
husband's friend who came to see him when he was dying in
Australia, and I had said it was the only, picture in the whole
Exhibition I should like to possess. This friend is in Australia
now.
(2) I was out to lunch just before going to Mrs. Leonard, and
saw—not a picture—but a piece of Staffordshire ware representing
Garibaldi and his horse. This naturally reminded me of '
The
Disciples ' and therefore of all the Australian incidents connected
with it.

REVIEW.
The History of Witchcraft and Demonology. By Montague
Summers. London. Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co.,
Ltd. 1926. {The History of Civilization. Edited by C. K.
Ogden.)
It is difficult to understand how this volume came to be included
in Messrs. Kegan Paul's admirable series, The History of Civiliza-
tion. The volumes hitherto published have been in the main
serious contributions to their respective subjects, and the writers
on Pre-History have not been chosen from those whose text-book
is the Book of Genesis, neither has Mr. Bryan, we hope, been
invited to offer an account of Evolution. We cannot think that
a volume comparable with Buckland's Reliquiae Diluvianae of
1823 would appear in Mr. Ogden's list, and this fact alone suffices
to distinguish sharply the position of psychical research as com-
pared with other sciences. For elsewhere the Noachian geology
and zoology are now relegated to the backwoods of thought, and
apparently it is only in the abstruse region of psycho-pathology
that demonologists and heresy hunters like Mr. Summers can make
themselves heard.
The present volume is not a history of witchcraft or of demono-
logy. It is a confused and illogical mass of descriptive matter
appertaining to both, highly spiced with crapulent material, and
accompanied by a running comment of disjointed extracts culled
from an immense mass of material relating to the Witch cult.
Mr. Summers thinks that witchcraft is connected with the
primitive Gnostic communities, which were guilty of every kind
of abomination, of which the details are set forth by their enemies
in the most lurid terms. Indeed witchcraft, as it existed in
Europe from the eleventh century, was " mainly the spawn of
Gnostic heresy "
(p. 29), for its real " foul essence " was the
worship of Satan. Satan, to Mr. Summers, is a very real person,
but his efforts to make our flesh creep cannot be said to have
succeeded. He discusses the " sin of the rebel angels," and we
learn that Lucifer had a high rank in the celestial hierarchy, but
he still wished to be God. Since God has produced miracles, the
Devil, God's ape, must therefore produce them also (excluding,
of course, those with the saints), and so the tricks of the Indian
juggler are explained, as well as the phenomena of the Sabbat.
December, 1926 Review 169
The phenomena of witchcraft are true because the learned doctors
of the Church affirm it, and even the " incubi " and " succubi
"
are realities. In this latter case, " all the great saints and scholars
and all moral theologians of importance " agree, and the demono-
logists also range themselves " in a solid phalanx of assent
"
(p. 93.)
It has only remained for Mr. Summers to prove scientifically
that this august body of witnesses is correct. The demons,
when they wish to fulfil their evil desires, are materialised from
ectoplasm, for are we not informed of incidents which " go far
to prove the partial re-materialisation of the dead by the vibra-
tions of the natural substance and ectoplasmic emanations of the
living " (p. 96) 1 Witchcraft and Satanism are then to Mr.
Summers horrid realities, which have existed in the past and con-
tinue to exist. In " those lone empty houses innocently pla-
carded '
To be Sold ' "
(p. 135), hideous rituals may be proceeding,
and the vile orgies of the Sabbat are often concentrated in quiet
Cathedral cities in a vain endeavour to disturb those peaceful
centres with " the foul brabble of devil worship "
(p. 151).
It is only by reading Mr. Summers' amazing analysis that one
can realise the ghastly fate of those unfortunate wretches who
incurred the suspicion of the Catholic authorities. What chance
had the early students of obscure phenomena or the participators
in a fertility cult before- men to whom demons were as common as
dogs, and who were profoundly ignorant of the most elementary
principles of medical psychology ? It is not difficult to under-
stand how men believed in these things in the days when the
scientific method was scarcely conceived. That they should
believe in them to-day is a melancholy commentary upon intel-
lectual progress. Perhaps encouragement may be sought in the
fact that those whose minds can still assimilate these monstrous
superstitions have no longer the power to exercise their talents
in burning their fellow creatures at the stake.

NOTES ON PERIODICALS.
The issue for July-September of the Journal of Abnormal and
Social Psychology has a brief account by Dr. H. H. Goddard of
a case of dual personality which has recently come under his
observation. The contrast between the alternating personalities
was strongly marked, and the case (that of a young woman of
nineteen years of age) presents several important and suggestive
features, of which the insistent idea of incestus patris is one of
the most interesting.
The American Journal of Psychology for October has a paper
on '
Mescal Visions and Eidetic Vision '
by Mr. Kliiver of Minnesota.
An account of the visions is given and the results of experiments
recorded in reference to those previously undertaken in connexion
with eidetic vision.
The Journal of the American S.P.R. for September has a paper
by Dr. Haines on Vaticination, in which he gives an account of
certain cases recorded in the past and also a further collection of
stories of the alleged poltergeist phenomena occurring in the
presence of the Roumanian peasant, Eleonore Zugun.
The Revue Metapsychique for May-June, 1926, has a continua-
tion of the description by Dr. Osty of the phenomena obtained
through the mediumship of M. Pascal Forthuny, and also a note
by Professor Richet on Dr. Moll's criticism of the Institute's
experiments with the medium Kahn. (See Journal, S.P.R. , June
1926, pp. 93-95.)
The substance of Professor Richet's reply is to the effect that
since Dr. Moll was not present at the sittings his criticism can
have little weight. " M. Moll n'a rien vu," writes Professor
Richet :
" il juge les choses de loin et de haut, a distance." Kahn
has not, in many instances, touched the papers, and therefore
M. Moll's suspicion that substitution has been practised is not
justified. Indeed M. Moll " ne nous a rien devoile : il ne pouvait
le faire puisqu'il n'etait pas la."
The Zeitschrift fur Parapsychologie for October has an account
by Mr. Krall of the alleged powers of telepathy exhibited by
Georges Ninoff, and in the same number Professor Driesch con-
tributes a paper on Psychical Research and Academic Science, of
which the English version formed his Presidential Address to the
Society. -p x
