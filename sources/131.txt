 1/1, September 1, 1867-March 1872. 16 pp.,  $1.00 a year.  The journal was one of those "burned out" in the great Chicago fire of 1871, but seems to have re-established itself for a short time thereafter.  Mrs. Lou Kimball was the sister of Hannah F.M. Brown who published the Little Bouquet.  The Western Star in its issue for July 1872 mentions "Mrs. Lou Kimball's bright little Lyceum Banner."  The Fourth National Convention of Spiritualists held in Cleveland, Ohio in 1867, appointed the journal as the repository of the Lyceum Statistical Bureau set up to promote Lyceums.  Although primarily an adjunct to the children's lyceum movement, the journal carefully inculcated short discussions of spiritualism.  It included puzzles, drawings and sheet music for children and contributions by H.T. Child, J.M. Peebles.  On Brown, see the notes under The Agitator and Little Bouquet.  She also had a hand in the beginnings of the Religio-Philosophical Journal and helped edit Moses Hull's Progressive Age.
