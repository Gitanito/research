my name is Carol rosin I&#39;m an educator
who became the first woman corporate
manager of an aerospace company
Fairchild industries I&#39;m a space and
missile defense consultant I&#39;ve
consulted to a number of companies
organizations government departments
even the intelligence community I was a
consultant to TRW working on the MX
missile so I was part of that strategy
which turned out to be a role model for
how to sell space-based weapons to the
public the MX missile being yet another
weapon system that we didn&#39;t need and I
founded the Institute for Security and
Cooperation in outer space a Washington
dc-based think-tank I&#39;m an author and
have testified before the Congress the
President&#39;s Commission on space and to a
number of committees of that kind of
relevance
when I was a corporate manager of
Fairchild industries in 1974 through 77
I met the late dr. Wernher von Braun in
early 74 at that time von Braun was
dying of cancer but he assured me that
he would live a few more years in order
to tell me about the game that was being
played that game being the effort to
weaponize space to control the Earth
from space and space itself von Braun
had a history of working with weapons
systems and had escaped from Penniman de
to come to this country and landed as
vice president of Fairchild industries
when I had met him
von Braun&#39;s purpose in life during the
last years of his life his dying years
was to educate the public and decision
makers about why space-based weapons are
a dumb dangerous destabilizing to costly
unnecessary unworkable undesirable idea
and about the alternatives that are
available and as a practically a
deathbed speech he educated me about
those concepts and who the players were
in this game and gave me the
responsibility since he was dying of
continuing this effort to prevent the
weaponization of outer space he invited
me to come up on the platform with him
and actually he&#39;s holding on to me and
in this picture I&#39;m trying to get off of
the platform and he&#39;s holding on to this
trying to make me laugh he&#39;s telling me
jokes when Verner von Braun was dying of
cancer he asked me to be his
spokesperson to appear on occasions when
he was too ill to speak and I did and
what he asked me to do was to educate
decision makers and the public about why
we shouldn&#39;t be putting weapons in space
why they&#39;re a dangerous destabilizing to
costly unnecessary untestable unworkable
idea and what the alternatives are how
we could be building a cooperative space
system what was most interesting to me
was a repent
of sentence that he said to me over and
over again during the approximately four
years that I had the opportunity of
working with him and that was the
strategy that was being used to educate
the public and decision makers and the
scare tactics the spin that was being
put on a weapon system and that was how
we identify an enemy the enemy at first
he said the enemy against whom we&#39;re
going to build a space-based weapons
system that he thought was a ridiculous
idea unnecessary and very dangerous not
to mention too costly etc the strategy
that Verner von Braun taught me was that
first the Russians are going to be
considered to be the enemy in fact when
I met him in 74 they were the enemy the
identified enemy we were told that they
had killer satellites we were told that
they were coming to get us and control
us the dirty commies that whole story
first the Russians were the enemy
against whom were going to build
space-based weapons then terrorists
would be identified and that was soon to
follow we heard a lot about terrorism
then we were going to identify third
world country crazies we now call them
nations of concern but he said that
would be the third enemy against whom we
would be needing to build space-based
weapons and the next enemy was asteroids
now at this point he kind of chuckled
the first time he said it asteroids
against asteroids were going to build
space-based weapons so it was funny then
and the funniest one of all was against
what he called aliens extraterrestrials
that would be the final card and over
and over and over during the four years
that I knew him and was giving his
speeches for him he would bring up that
last card and remember Carol the last
card is the alien card we&#39;re going to
have to build space-based weapons
against aliens and all of it he said is
a lie a lie I think I was too naive to
know at that time the seriousness of the
nature of the spin that was being put on
the system
and now the pieces are starting to fall
into place we&#39;re building a space-based
weapon system based on a premise that is
a lie a spin and Verner von braun was
trying to hint that to me back in the
early 70s and right up until the moment
when he died in 1977 what he told me was
is that there is an accelerated effort
in place he didn&#39;t mention a time line
but he said that it was going to be
speeding up faster than anybody could
possibly imagine
that the effort to put weapons in space
was not only based on a lie but would
accelerate past the point of people even
understanding it until it was already up
there and too late when von Braun was
dying in front of me the very first day
that I met him he had tubes draining out
of his side and he was tapping on the
desk telling me you will come to
Fairchild I was a school teacher you
will come to Fairchild and you will be
responsible for keeping weapons out of
space and the way he said it with the
intenseness in his eyes and added that
very first day the first time I met him
that space-based weapons were a
dangerous destabilizing to costly
unnecessary untestable unworkable idea
and that the last card that was being
held was the extra-terrestrial enemy
card the intensity with which he said
that made me realize that he knew
something that he was too afraid to
mention he was too afraid to talk about
it
he would not tell me the details I&#39;m not
sure that I would have absorbed them if
he had told me the details or even
believed him in 1974 but there was no
question that that man knew and had a
need to know I found out later there&#39;s
no doubt in my mind that Verner von
Braun knew about the extra-terrestrial
issue the very first meeting that I had
with him in 1974 when he said to me you
will be responsible for keeping
weapons out of space I&#39;m dying of cancer
and you have to take over for me and
when he explained to me the reasons for
why weapons were going to be put into
space the enemies against whom we were
going to build these weapons and that
all of that was a lie and when he
mentioned the extra-terrestrial card
that extraterrestrials aliens he called
them were going to be identified as the
final enemy against whom we were going
to build space-based weapons back in 74
the way he said it to me there was no
doubt no doubt in my mind that he knew
something that he was too afraid to talk
about Verner von Braun never spoke to me
about any of the details that he knew or
might have known or thought about
related to extraterrestrials except that
extraterrestrials were one day going to
be identified as an enemy against whom
we are going to have to build an
enormous space-based weapons system even
though he didn&#39;t give me the details
however the look in his eyes made it
clear to me that he knew that there was
something going on that was a big secret
that he could not divulge Verner von
Braun actually told me that the spin was
a lie
that the premise for space-based
weaponry the reasons that were going to
be given the enemies that we were going
to identify were all based on a lie I&#39;ve
been tracking the space-based weapons
issue for about 26 years I have debated
generals congressional representatives
I&#39;ve testified before the Congress and
the Senate I&#39;ve met with people in over
a hundred countries and I have not been
able to identify who the people are who
are making this space-based weapon
system happen I see the news I see the
administrative decisions being made I
know that they&#39;re all based on lies and
greed and I have yet to be able to
identify who the people are and that&#39;s
after tracking this issue for 26 years
I know that there are big secrets being
kept and I know it&#39;s time that the
public and decision makers pay attention
to the people who are now going to be
disclosing the truth and then we need to
make some definite changes and build a
system in space that will benefit every
single person and all the animals and
the environment of this planet the
technology is there the solutions to
Earth&#39;s urgent and long-term potential
problems are there and I have a feeling
that once we start studying this
extraterrestrial issue all of the
questions are going to be answered that
I&#39;ve had for 26 years I have concluded
that it&#39;s based on a few people making a
lot of money and gaining power it&#39;s
about ego it&#39;s not about our essence and
who we really are on the planet and
loving each other and being at peace and
cooperating using technologies to solve
problems and heal people in the planet
it isn&#39;t about that it&#39;s about a few
people who really are playing an old
dangerous costly game for their own
pocketbooks and power struggle that&#39;s
all it is and I believe that this entire
space-based weapons game is initiated
right here in the United States of
America
and what I hope is that with a new
administration I hope that this
information that&#39;s being disclosed will
allow the new administration to do what
is right which is to transform the war
game into a space game so that we use
the technologies that are available not
just the spin-offs of war technology but
as direct technological applications to
building a cooperative space system that
will benefit the entire world and that
will allow us to communicate with the
extra-terrestrial cultures that are
obviously out there I helped to start
the movement to prevent the
weaponization of outer space I founded
the Institute for Security and
Cooperation in outer space in Washington
DC which was a think-tank with an action
component we studied this issue of
who was going to benefit from building a
space-based weapons program which is
merely an extension of the earthbound
war game of course the next-highest
frontier the high ground is outer space
so it&#39;s a very natural place for those
who play in the war game who benefit
from it to go into outer space with
their weapons who would benefit from it
are the people who work in that arena
that&#39;s people in the military in
industries in universities and labs in
the intelligence community and this is
not just in the United States it&#39;s
worldwide this is a worldwide
cooperative system wars are cooperative
just as peace will be when it breaks out
but right now there are a lot of people
benefiting this is what our economy has
been based on in this country and
spreading around the world were and
people suffer as a result
it&#39;s not fair it never has been people
have screamed for let&#39;s build out of
swords let&#39;s make plowshares let&#39;s have
peace and hold hands around the world
but it hasn&#39;t worked because too many
people are benefiting not only are they
benefiting financially but from what my
experience is there are people who
actually believe that Armageddon should
happen so we have to have these wars so
it&#39;s going from the pocketbook to the
religious right some people who actually
believe that we have to have wars for
these religious reasons and there are
people who just love war I have met
warriors who love to go to war and then
there are the good people the soldiers
who just take orders and they have to
feed their children and send them to
college so they want to keep their jobs
people in laboratories have told me they
don&#39;t want to work on these technologies
for war but if they don&#39;t they won&#39;t get
a paycheck who&#39;s going to pay them and
what I see is that there are not only
dual uses for these technologies but
there are many uses for the same
technologies and once people start to
learn as we learned about the bomb they
start to learn
and about what&#39;s in outer space this
place above all of our heads this common
place above all of our heads in which we
can travel we can build space hospitals
schools hotels laboratories farms
industries may sound far out but if we
don&#39;t do that we&#39;re going to build
battle stations and weapons pointed down
all of our throats and into space and
apparently we&#39;ve been doing some of that
already so we have a choice now that can
be made we can all benefit all the
people in the military-industrial
complex in the intelligence community
and universities and labs in the United
States and all over the world we can
benefit we can just transform that
industry so easily with just a decision
based on our highest consciousness on
our spirituality and on the fact that we
have no choice unless we all want to die
and we don&#39;t not yet anyway so now we
can all benefit financially spiritually
socially psychologically and it&#39;s
technologically and politically feasible
to transform this game now and everybody
will benefit in 1977 I was at a meeting
in Fairchild industries in a conference
room called the war room and in that
movement room were a lot of charts on
the walls with enemies identified
enemies names that people had never
heard of names like Saddam Hussein and
Gaddafi but we were talking then about
terrorists the potential terrorists no
one had ever talked about this before
but this was the next stage after the
Russians of against whom we were going
to build space-based weapons these
terrorists and I stood up in this
meeting and I said excuse me why are we
talking about these potential enemies
against whom were going to build
space-based weapons if in fact we know
that they are not the enemy at this time
and they continued the conversation
about how they were going to antagonize
these enemies and that at some point
there was going to be a war in the Gulf
a Gulf War now this is 19
1977 this 1977 and they were talking
about creating a war in the Gulf region
when there was 25 billion dollars in the
space-based weapons program that yet had
not been identified it wasn&#39;t called the
Strategic Defense Initiative at least
until 1983 this weapon system then had
obviously been going on for some time
that I didn&#39;t know anything about so I
stood up in this meeting in 1977 and it
said I&#39;d like to know why we&#39;re talking
about space-based weapons against these
enemies I&#39;d like to know more about this
would somebody tell me what this is
about
nobody answered they went on with this
meeting as though I hadn&#39;t said anything
and suddenly I heard myself stand up in
the room and say if nobody can tell me
why you were planning a war in the Gulf
when there&#39;s a certain amount of money
in a budget so that you can create the
next set of weapon systems that will be
the beginning of the sell to the public
about why we need space-based weapons
consider this my resignation and you
will hear from me again and nobody said
word because they were planning award
the Gulf and it happened exactly as they
planned it on time if anyone had any
doubt at all about how far advanced the
research and development program the
largest R&amp;D program in recorded history
is today these books are proof this is
the national missile defense deployment
environmental impact statement but it
comes in four huge volumes and they&#39;re
being sent all over the country maybe
even the different parts of the world to
our allies there were lists on the wall
of identified enemies against whom we
were going to build space-based weapons
they were also talking about the plans
to create the Gulf War and that&#39;s when
the Gulf War was first being planned
back in 1977 it was at this meeting the
room was filled with people in the
revolving door game there were people
that I had seen once in a military
uniform and other times in a gray suit
in an industry outfit these people play
a revolving door game they work as
consultants industry people and/or
military and intelligence people they
work in the industries and they revolve
themselves through these doors and right
into government positions I stood up in
this meeting and asked if I was hearing
correctly that when there was twenty
five billion dollars expended in the
space-based weapons budget the research
and development budget that there was
going to be a war in the Gulf stimulated
created so that they could then sell the
next phase of weapons to the public and
the decision makers that this war was
going to be created so that they could
dump the old weapons and create a whole
new set of weapons I had to resign from
that position I could no longer work in
that industry and in that room were the
revolving door people they were people
whom I had seen in military uniforms in
their gray pinstripe business suits the
same people I see them then getting jobs
in the government they&#39;re affiliated
with the intelligence community and our
universities this is the
military-industrial complex and they are
in revolving door jobs in about 1990 I
was sitting in my living room looking at
now the money that had been spent on
space-based weapons research and
development programs and I realized that
it had come to that number about twenty
five billion dollars and I said to my
husband I am now going to stop
everything I&#39;m going to stop and sit and
watch CNN television and I&#39;m going to
wait for the war to happen and my
husband said well you finally gone over
the lid you have flipped out friends
said you have really gone too far this
time there is not going to be a war in
the Gulf nobody&#39;s talking about a war in
the Gulf and I said there&#39;s going to be
a war in the Gulf I&#39;m going to sit here
and wait for the war in the Gulf
it happened right on schedule as part of
the war game in the Gulf of course we
were told we the public that the United
States was successfully shooting down
Russian Scud missiles and we were
rationalizing new budgets based on that
success in fact we found out later after
the budgets were approved for the next
phase of weapons that it was a lie we
did not have the technology we did not
have successful shoot downs the way we
were told it was all a lie just to get
money more money put in the budgets to
make more weapons I was one of the first
people to go independently to Russia
when I heard that they had killer
satellites and when I went to Russia in
the early 70s I found out they didn&#39;t
have killer satellites that was a lie
and in fact the Russian leaders and
people wanted peace they wanted to
cooperate with the United States and the
people of the world when another time
Hey another time I called Saddam Hussein
when he was lighting his oil will when
he was lighting his oil fields on fire
and my husband was in the kitchen while
I was making this phone call and I got a
call back from his first attache with
Saddam Hussein nearby I was told saying
are you a reporter are you an agent why
do you want to know and I said no I&#39;m
just a citizen who helped to start the
movement to prevent the weaponization of
outer space and I have found that a lot
of the stories that I&#39;ve been told about
weapons systems and the enemies are not
true so I wanted to find out what Saddam
Hussein wants what would satisfy him to
have him stopped making these oil fields
go on fire and stop antagonizing people
and he said well nobody&#39;s ever asked him
that question what he wants so when I
hear that there&#39;s a possible threat of
extraterrestrials and I look at the
history of thousands of years of
possible visitations recorded history
and when I hear now the stories of the
disclosures of honest military
intelligence industry people who have
had experiences with UFOs with crashes
and landings with live or dead bodies of
extraterrestrial being
people from out in the universes and if
I&#39;m ever told that these are enemies
against whom we have to build
space-based weapon systems based on my
own personal experience of having worked
in the military-industrial complex
on weapons systems and military strategy
I&#39;m going to know it&#39;s a lie it&#39;s a lie
and I&#39;m not only not going to believe it
but I&#39;m going to go out as loudly as I
can and tell everyone to take a look
they have not taken us away yet we&#39;re
still here after thousands of years of
visits if in fact they&#39;re still visiting
us now and people are working with ETS
live or dead if they&#39;re taking
photographs of their experiencing all
kinds of UFO experiences then we have to
look at this as something that is not a
hostile occurrence it would be my guess
based on my own experience of having
traveled to countries whom we&#39;ve been
told had hostile intentions against the
United States it would be my hope and my
intention to do everything I could to
work with people who are working to
communicate with and cooperate with
these extraterrestrial beings because
they&#39;re clearly not hostile we&#39;re here
that&#39;s enough proof for me I have a
vision based on the new information that
I&#39;m learning about related to
extraterrestrials and the information
the technology the techniques for
communicating and sharing information
that we have the potential on this
planet now of actually living in a state
of peace based on the information the
technology the direct applications of
all of that to all the people of the
world to our environment and other
animals the plants the air sea and land
I think that we can have a clean and
healthy environment with a happy
peaceful dancing musical artistic planet
with people who want to make money they
can still make money with their
investments there are enormous
investment possibilities and
technologies that can be developed there
we are seeing tastes of it now just in
the fields of transportation
communication healing techniques life
extension techniques the potential is
unlimited the opportunities and benefits
for careers for jobs the opportunities
and benefits for health of our
individual selves of whole communities
of our planet itself the potential for
education for being able to communicate
from the technological ways to maybe
telepathically the communication and
education techniques as an educator so
excitement we can be sharing our lives
our cultures respecting our differences
learning about what each other wants and
most important of all we can be touching
our own essence the essence of our own
beings the essence of extraterrestrial
beings we can reach that state of love
on this planet what could be more
exciting than that and those people who
want to be leaders can those people who
just want to sit in the light can there
is no limit to how people can choose to
live on this planet we have a chance to
do that and I think the window is
closing rapidly
I don&#39;t think we have much time in which
to make that decision we&#39;re too close in
too many ways to either dying our
physical bodies to having some horrible
disaster happen to having some sort of
war take place whether it&#39;s from a
high-technology or an exotic weapons
system or a bacterial or viral a
biological or chemical warfare a
suitcase bomb an atomic bomb I mean what
are we talking about when we have the
capability of communicating worldwide I
see that as a vision that&#39;s a reality
there&#39;s no question that we can have
that right now but it takes a leader and
from what I hear from talking with
soldiers industry people university
people with the people around the world
is that it has to start with the United
States President and that&#39;s whom we all
have to reach if you&#39;re in
national if you&#39;re around the world if
you&#39;re in the United States of America
whether you&#39;re from any party or any
belief system or any religion the United
States commander in chief the president
of the United States is the person that
needs to be reached and we need to say
that we want an ultimate comprehensive
verifiable ban on all space-based
weapons including exotic weapons that we
have yet to dream about Verner von Braun
gave me the assignment of preventing the
weaponization of outer space from
happening but what he said to me over
and over again was that his real concern
his greatest concern was about
psychotronic weapons he discuss what
those were no he didn&#39;t discuss what
they were but he repeated over and over
to me that this was the real concern
this is what we should really be
concerned about but he would add the
public however won&#39;t understand that yet
so let&#39;s just call for the ban on
space-based weapons that can be
understood it can be measured it can be
done and once you have a ban on
space-based weapons you&#39;ve put a lid on
the arms race people have become aware
they&#39;ve become connected consciously and
they will begin to understand that there
are alternatives but his real concern
the biggest concern he had was about the
psychotronic weapon those are mind
controlled weapons mind controlled
people or technology very dangerous
weapons the first big speech that I gave
for Verner von Braun was in July of 1974
it was soon after I had met him just a
few months after I had met him he gave
me the assignment of speaking in Chicago
at McCormick Hall to 18,000 people
the only other speech I had ever given
was in a PTA meeting and I had rehearsed
that speech in the mirror the night
before about mustard being squirted in
the cafeteria by the children I was so
nervous now I was going to appear before
18,000 people nervous takes on a new
meaning
what he said to me was however I&#39;m going
to send you five books in a taxicab take
these pink index cards and take some
notes and you will introduce a live
satellite demonstration the Fiji Islands
some other countries and you will tell
about this live satellite demonstration
I have no idea what he was talking about
and he said but that&#39;s not a worry
either don&#39;t worry you don&#39;t have to
really read all of these books because
I&#39;m going to transmit the speech to you
and I said how are you going to transmit
the speech to me you&#39;re going into the
hospital and he said I&#39;m going to
transmit it as though you&#39;re talking on
the telephone
well I memorized the best I could these
little pink index cards and I got up on
the stage there were 18,000 people in
front of me there was a podium with my
picture on it I had to put my hand over
the screen I had no idea what I was
going to say because I couldn&#39;t see the
pink index cards because I was
perspiring and it was dripping down my
face when suddenly I heard in my left
ear Werner von Braun talking to me like
he was talking on the telephone and he
transmitted this speech to me the entire
speech for 35 minutes in my left ear I
heard myself then talking about kayuu
band and C band and I was just repeating
what he was saying but he was in a
hospital bed on the East Coast and I was
in Chicago with nothing no technology in
my ear standing in front of 18,000
people listening to him transmit the
speech it was amazing
did he ever relay to you how that was
effected no he laughed when I asked him
he thought it was funny I sent it with
my autograph to him I thought that was
funny that I would sign my autograph to
him but he sent it back now with his and
he says to Carol sue this time it was my
turn
verner von braun when verner von braun
transmitted into my left ear this entire
speech from the east coast of chicago it
be
very obvious to me that we humans have
absolutely no idea except what we&#39;re
told by people who are making money on
the next levels and phases of
technological developments that we are
purchasing as consumers what is possible
we have barely touched the tip of the
iceberg of what the mind is capable of
creating and we create all of these
technologies including our own attitudes
our own philosophies in life our ways of
behaving and relating to people are
choices that our minds our egos create
that became very clear to me as I
started actually integrating the fact
that he had transmitted the speech to me
and it was real and I didn&#39;t go public
about that for years because I knew that
people would not believe me they would
think that this was completely insane
but in fact it happened it was real
there seems to be some reason to
discredit very viable and very reputable
witnesses when they say something is
unidentified well you show me the end
individual it can identify everything in
the heavens and I will show you the
second coming
