  		  4457.    Kimberly M FDE     12/27/2017.      FDE 8473.            As the car slid toward a guard rail, I noticed that I was observing everything in slow motion from above and behind my body. I could see the back of my right shoulder and the blouse I was wearing. I was completely at peace during this time. I had many thoughts despite what I was seeing was in slow motion.  
  Fear-death experience at time they lost control of the car on a snowy road.   

    4456.    Gabriela L Possible NDE     12/23/2017.      Possible NDE 8471.       From Portugal. Narrative in Portuguese, translated to English by Hector.  The sensation of levitating stopped after I was carried to hospital. During the following minutes I did not feel nothing abnormal. I felt only nervousness and anxiety over not knowing what was going to happen.

    4455.    Alicia M NDE     12/22/2017.      NDE 8469.       From Spain. Original in Spanish, translated to Spanish by Sean.     I saw a place devoid of light but full of love and peace. I was accompanied by Beings, despite not being able to see them. I was aware of the Beings and that this was something fantastic. I felt in my mind that one of them was talking to me. It was in a masculine voice that was very sweet and soft, with lots of love. He told me that my life on earth had ended. He told me that I had lived my life well and that for this reason, they were giving me a choice. He asked me if I would like to stay here with them or if I would like to return.  
  NDE during surgery.   

    4454.    Nicoleta P Possible NDE     12/21/2017.      Possible NDE 8465.       From Romanian. Original in Romanian, translated to English by Sabina.     What made me write to you was that while I was in a coma, I met my father who passed away in 1999. He told me that he doesn’t want to take me with him because I will get better. 
  Possible NDE from a car accident.   

    4453.    Lynn Z NDE     12/18/2017.      NDE 8466.       Exceptional experience.     I was in a thin and large transparent 'tube,' like a very thin membrane that I could see through. I was 'running' through the tube at light-speed, watching the stars and the universe go by. The amazing part, to me at the time, was that I could not walk at all, since I used a wheelchair and was completely stiffened . This experience of actually running was so freeing, so amazing, and so wonderful! Looking forward, the tube seemed endless as it was twisting away into eternal space. But I didn't care because I was so free, and with every running-step, it took me eons away. Then I was suddenly in a beautiful place. There was a meadow to my left as it descended down a rolling hill with wildflowers. There was a lush, green forest in the distance beyond the meadow.  
  NDE due to complication of anesthesia.  Though confined to a wheelchair in life she was ‘running’ in the experience.   

    4452.    Jeri W NDE     12/17/2017.      NDE 8460.            I 'felt' like I was outdoors. I think there was short, pale-green grass underfoot. I could only see a few inches to either side of my feet, as if I were standing in a column of clear air. The bright, dry mist was everywhere else and thinned-out overhead. I STRONGLY remember the smell of wildflowers blooming. There might also have been fruit-blossom scents. There were many flowers that were lightly scented; nothing heavy. They were wonderfully fresh, clean, and sweet-smelling. There was a very light breeze, and I remember being absolutely comfortable. There was no sense of hot or cold; just a sense of my surroundings being the same temperature as me. 
  NDE at age 13 due to complication of dental anesthetic.   

  4451.    Adoración NDE     12/17/2017.      Secondhand NDE 8459.       From Spain. Original in Spanish, translated to Spanish by Sean.     My mother was floating abover her body when her companion screamed and told the others about what had happened. Mother was sad for the shock she had given the other girl. She was looking down from the top of the room like a bird, and could see everything. Then she was in a tunnel, like clouds and a vortex, through which she travelled towards a light.  
  Mother's NDE due to an allergic reaction.   
  
    4450.    Volley B NDEs     12/11/2017.      NDEs 8458.            As I looked around, I saw my uncle again. In our communication, I never saw his mouth move, he just kept that smile. It was more like his voice was put right into my head. He was smiling at me as he said, 'Hello again' I remember laughing and he raised his arms and asked, 'Do you like it?' as he referred to my surroundings. I answered, 'Yes I do.' He brought one of his arms down and motioned towards the pond as he said, 'This is where we are going to be doing our fishing.' As I looked down I could see that I was standing about an inch off the top of the water. I looked straight down into the pond and saw large fish swimming around.  
  Two NDEs due to cardiac arrests.  Was in similar place during both NDEs.   

    4449.    Fawn R Probable NDE     12/9/2017.      Probable NDE 8456.            I was completely and frighteningly alone. There was no sound and time did not exist. Snapshots of my life floated by but they had lost all their meaning to me. I had to let all emotional attachment go from the individual people and memories, but I had a general feeling of being incredibly sad and very much alone. At one point, I wondered how long I had been in the void. I could have been floating there for 1000 years or maybe it was 3 minutes, but it seemed to me for about a 1000 years.  
  Probable NDE due to alcohol overdose a week ago.   
  
    4448.    Robyn C NDE     12/9/2017.      NDE 8454.       From New Zealand     The first thing I remember is floating up into a horizontal tunnel. There was a high-pitched buzzing sound in my ears but it didn't bother me. I felt an overwhelming sense of complete bliss and contentment and was overwhelmed by the intensity of these emotions. The closest way I can explain it is the sensation of feeling on your skin when diving into water and feeling the sensation of the water on your face. It is like complete involvement in all the sensory input you are feeling because you are in the moment and nothing else matters.
  NDE due to choking on food, falling, and hitting head.   

    4447.    Marica NDE     12/7/2017.      NDE 8453.       From Italy. Original in Italian.     I found myself into a tunnel of light, which wasn't blinding. It was yellow, warm, and welcoming. I felt that I was part of this light that was transmitting happiness to me. Within this lighted tunnel, I saw it was extending about 50 to 60 centimeters above myself. Then I felt like I was at the end of this tunnel. I felt that beyond the tunnel was my children that I spontaneously aborted yesterday afternoon.  
  NDE due to faint after miscarriage.   

    4446.    Fiona Probable NDE     12/7/2017.      Probable NDE 23260.       From the UK     I felt an overwhelming calmness, acceptance and peace like I had never experienced before or since that time. It was a beautiful feeling. I was watching several nurses fiddling around in front of me. I looked down over my left shoulder to see myself completely unresponsive and lying down on the trolley. I thought, 'Oh that's me.' I realized the nurses were working on my heart to try and help me, but I didn't look at the detail. I just calmly accepted that they were trying to save me.
  Probable NDE associated with surgery.   

    4445.    Jia Ming Possible NDE    12/6/2017.   Possible NDE 16093.        Original in Chinese. Translated to English from Jenny.    In that multi-dimensional realm, Jia felt timeless and she was indifferent to the physical world. She used used the word 'extremely' three times during the interview to emphasize that it only mattered to a soul which ranking of levels it was assigned when he/she departured from the flesh. There seemed to be judgment on the other side. It appeared to be judgment of a soul using earthly unethical standards according to human perception. 
   Possible NDE because the coma makes it hard to tell when the experience happened. It could be a NDE, but it also could be ICU psychosis.   

  4444.    Alessandro P Probable NDE     12/5/2017.      Probable NDE 8437.       From Italy. Original in Italian.     Suddenly, I felt good. There was light and I was at peace. I saw myself from above my body. I soared about two or three meters, and then I found myself in a room. I can see no walls, only a low and light ceiling. I am very fine. I then saw a man in a nice gray suit who was lying on a bench. He gots up and turned around. It was my grandfather who died twenty years earlier who I adored!  
  Probable NDE from car accident.   

      4443.    Georg S Probable NDE     12/5/2017.      Probable NDE 8412.       From Sweden. Original in Swedish, translated to English by Azure.     I experienced pure love. There was no guilt, shame, or compulsion. The only thing that existed was pure, complete, and unconditional love. The love was so good and had answers to everything so that I had no questions to wonder about. The happiness I felt was total. To have gotten to know this love is the greatest gift I have had in my life.  
  Probable NDE due to severe car accident.   

    4442.    Marina A NDE     12/1/2017.      NDE 8444.       From Yugoslavia. Original in Croatian, translated to English by Maja.  The next thing I remember is that I found myself in the long tunnel through which I was moving forward. I wasn't walking because I didn't have the body. I began to realize that I was dying. I didn't want to die. Then I began fighting with all I had to get back to life.   
  Clinically apparent death.   
  
    4441.    Matteo C NDE     11/28/2017.      NDE 8447.       From France.  Original in French, translated to English by Marguy.     I found myself floating above the water. I looked towards the water below; I was several meters above and I think that I was looking towards my body. I had no thought at all. What shocked me the most was the silence. It was as if I felt the nature surrounding me. I looked around and saw the lake and the trees. There was no sound. I felt like I was a part of a whole; of something bigger than me, bigger than the world, something that was connecting us to the surrounding nature. I didn't think for a single second. My thoughts seemed like something else. I really couldn't explain what it was. I didn't think, but I 'realized' everything. I realized that nature surrounded me. I realized the blow of the wind passing through me, but also as if it was a part of me.
  NDE due to drowning.   

      4440.    Taiwan University Student    11/27/2017.      NDE 16092.        Original in Chinese. Translated to English from Jenny.

    4439.    Francesca Possible NDE     11/27/2017.      Possible NDE 8450.            I can still recall the sheer fear of falling backwards into what felt like pitch black tunnel of jelly, unable to stop the fall. Next thing, I was on the roof of the operating room looking down on the table with my body, a Nun and medical staff surrounding it. I was not scared; I could see the homes and traffic outside as if the hospital walls did not exist.

    4438.    Chris B NDE     11/27/2017.      NDE 8449.            After realizing that I had yanked myself out of my body, I went midair and saw my guardian angels on each side. They were about 8 feet 6 inches in height and the wings were about 5 to 6 feet across. 
  NDE due to suicide attempt.   

    4437.    Majid A NDE     11/27/2017.      NDE 8448.       From Iran. Original in Persian, translated to English by Amir.     I had a strange feeling, like I just had been released from a very tight and pressing casting of my body. I never had felt so good before. Suddenly, I looked down and saw that I was floating in the air and saw myself from above lying down on the ground. My friends had circled around me and one of them was resting my head on his lap. He was shaking me to get up. I looked at them for a short while, but don’t know what happened.  
  NDE from going unconscious.   

    4436.    Lonnie C Probable NDE     11/27/2017.      Probable NDE 8445.            One afternoon, I found 'myself' floating above our small house. I could see the roof of our house from above, as well as the yard and the woods. I saw everything from a bird’s eye view which is an angle I had never seen before. 
  Probable NDE from cardiac problems at age 4.  Shared 52 years later.   

    4435.    Gwen B NDE     11/20/2017.      NDE 8441.            There was no sense of individual Beings, but there was a multiple presence. I had an overwhelming feeling of contentment and well-being. Of course, I had no eyes or ears, but I clearly 'heard' the communication of, 'You may stay or go, it is your decision. There are things we would like you to do, but it is your choice.' There was no judgment or pressure. Rather the communication had an impartial, almost bored tone. I replied, 'I guess I’ll go back.' Immediately a roaring whirlpool/tunnel opened up and pulled me toward it. 
  NDE due to kick in the head by a horse at age 16.  Shared 50 years later.   

    4434.    Ingrid H NDE     11/20/2017.      NDE 8440.       Exceptional Experience. Originally from Columbia where the experience happened.  Next, I was looking at my mom walking down the street several blocks away from the house, coming up on her bus stop. Time and distance had vanished for me; I could be anywhere at any time. It wasn’t until that moment that I realized that I didn’t possess a defined form. I could communicate with everything and I was part of everything. It was like the Wholeness and I were one. As I sank into an atmosphere of pure bright light I had the clear awareness that before I became human, I was a being made of pure light, just as I was now.   
  NDE due to drowning at 2 (nearly 3) years old.   

    4433.    Taylor NDE     11/15/2017.      NDE 8436.            The best I can describe it is two giant skies or atmospheres, split into two halves, like a split screen image with one sky on my left and the other on my right with a line down the middle separating them. Both sides were full of color. It scene was very galaxy-like and spacey. The left had bright, sunny colors like yellow, light blue, white, and soft wispy cloud-like things everywhere. The right had darker colors, but not in a bad way. They were like deep sunset colors of red, gold, burnt orange, dark purple and black. Almost like a dawn on the left and dusk on the right. And in the middle of the right side was a tall thin white structure like a column or pedestal that went so high I couldn't see the top.  
  NDE due to auto accident and head injury at age 14.   

    4432.    Keith R NDE     11/15/2017.      NDE 8435.            Then a small pinhole light appeared at the end of the tunnel. As I got closer to it, the light got bigger and bigger. It was a brilliant white color, but not blinding. There was a warm, loving feeling coming from it. I could not make out what it was though. As I got closer to the light, a figure of a person started to emerge. The closer I got, the clearer the image got. It was Jesus Christ. 
  NDE at age 17 due to cardiac arrest from unknown cause.   

      4431.    Paige R Possible NDE     11/12/2017.      Possible NDE 8434.       From Canada.     I could see a light through the water illuminating me, I looked around and there was nothing but darkness and a brown/grey color from the light illuminating the water. It felt like I was floating in the ocean with nothing around for as far as I could see. I looked up again and then looked to my left and saw myself floating, illuminated by that light.

    4430.    Catherine FDE     11/9/2017.      FDE 8430.            I saw an image of my life as it was flipping fast-forward, like pages flipping in a book.

    4426.    Doug F NDE     11/5/2017.      NDE 8422.        Exceptional experience.    Looking at the body, what arose was the perfection of the life just lived. This life could not be described as pleasant. In fact, it was filled with suffering and hardship. Yet it seemed so perfect as it was observed. Then other lives lived started to appear in a visual format. Each life appeared in a bubble; the entire life from beginning to end, in an instant, with awareness of every moment of that life as if it was just lived from birth to death. There were many lives, too many to count. Each life was perfect. Reincarnation is part of the human experience, but it is optional. Once I was aware of the addictions pulling me back to another life, then I was ready for what came next.

This was immediately followed by a great sadness because I knew I would never know my child or live a long life with my husband. I also felt calm and peaceful. I used the pleasant and distressing descriptor above because it was the closest. I was aware that I was dying or dead. We passed a window and I noted that it was still dark which meant it was before 5 am. I knew I'd never see the light of a day again.   
  Probable NDE during delivery.

From France     I saw every single second of my life that went in front of me; from my birth until the last second previous to the experience. Events were like photos that soembody would flip in front of me. Each time that I was not in a state of unconditional love, the photo stopped and a voice asked me, 'What could you do to behave differently? When I felt what I should have done, the pictures continued. Everything went very quickly.  Or should I say that since there is no real time, it seemed to go very quickly. It was not a painful experience as nobody was judging me.  They were just asking me.

I first looked for the sun, but found nothing that provided a light source for the daylight conditions. I then looked across the river, to see such an amazing world of mountains, trees, waterfalls, exotic flowers. Everywhere was green, green, green! It looked like our own natural world, but on steroids. There was so much life with colors, textures, light, and smells that were all in a state of absolute perfection and abundance. I could scarcely take it in.

From South Africa     The light communicated telepathically with me, indicating that I am very welcome but it is not my time to be here yet. It was authoritative but with a sense of loving humor. It did not come to me that this was GOD. It seemed to be a higher Being, but not Jesus. It was so natural. We discussed my life while I relived, portions of it. We reviewed my life proceeding from oldest to younger events and only stopping when I seem to be uncertain of my own actions at the time. There was no condemnation and no right or wrong. There was complete acceptance and understanding with only one loving comment, 'Don't you think you could have done it this way?' I was judging myself. 
  NDE due to being struck by mini-bus.   

    4418.    Patrick M NDE     10/25/2017.      NDE 8416.            I got up from the seat and turned around 180 degrees to see my body still in the chair.

    4417.    Teresa M NDE     10/22/2017.      NDE 8410.       Exceptional Experience.  I also experienced a knowing of my mother's future through two separate scenarios: One if I decided to leave this life, and one if I decided to stay. The knowing felt like a gift being given and even though I had a 3-year-old mentality I was able to receive this information as if I was a mature person. I cannot relate how much time passed, but I remember making a decision. Once I did this, I felt myself pulled back into the body I had been watching below me.

I was walking towards the opened doors. I couldn't see my body at all, but I could see this BEAUTIFUL white, bright light all over me. As I approached the doors, I was held back by a force. It was not a hand or anything physical, but it was a force. Immediately, I heard a voice that told me, 'You cannot enter that room my son.' This communication was like telepathy, not a physical voice. I understood I was in a different place and that I was dead. I felt very relaxed with a great feeling of being calm, no pain, and no worries. I had a sense of Happiness and love surrounded me.

When the footsteps stopped, I was in front of the door and not down the little hall. But I had never moved. I was not standing or sitting, I just was staring at the door. I wasn't afraid. Then a man's voice said, 'If you want to leave, all you have do is open the door and step through. If you want to, you can.' I said without baby talk, maybe it was thinking my answers but I responded, 'No, I want to stay.'

My body was lying parallel to my point of view from the right (head) to the left (feet). Actually my perspective was impossible as I was looking down from a bigger height as the actual ceiling was. I guess about 4 meters. The real ceiling was a normal height of about 2.5 meters.  My friend was moving at the side of my head, so it wasn't a fixed image.  I had no pain or respiratory distress. Everything was relaxed.  Then in the right upper angle of vision a bright shining circle appeared. From there came a squawking voice (like the voice of Mickey Mouse) that said to me that I could come if I wanted to. Everything would be okay.

I felt an immense universal love and peace in me. I felt like being on a cloud, but also in the cloud and myself the cloud. I was filled with a happiness that is not known on this earth. Then felt strongly the hand of my deceased grandmother, taking my hand to reassure myself. Don't ask how I know it, as communication was intuitive and not verbal, but I know that they made me come back, as my son of 7 years at the time, has to experience an 'important' future, and it is my mission to go with him.... then to 'elevate' myself spiritually for my next lives.

    4408.    Merrideth H NDE     10/16/2017.      NDE 8401.            I looked up at the ceiling and became curious to know if I could fly through the ceiling and leave. I don't know why I wanted to do that. I was just very curious and I was already out of body. So 'impossible' wasn't a word in my vocabulary at that moment. But the moment I decided to fly out of the room, someone entered the room with me. I could not see who it was, but in retrospect, I think it was an angel or Jesus. At the time though, I had no idea who it was. I just felt his presence enter the room and slowly come towards me. Using telepathy the Being started speaking to me.

I know this isn't my life review. I know that I am not in heaven. The Being of light is behind me with his hands on my shoulders as I watch all the destruction and rage of humanity while they destroy each other and the world, over and over again. I saw so much hatred and bad scenes that it stuck with me after this. I looked to both, my left and right, and there are thousands and thousands, if not, millions of us watching our screens with our Being of light behind us.

I returned to the hospital at ceiling level and had no idea of location. I began searching for my earthly body.

It was so dark and I could not see anything below me, so it was hard to figure out what was going on. As they pulled me downwards toward them, I began to feel progressively colder. As the Beings pulled me into their midst, it seemed squishy and wet, as well as dark and cold. Meanwhile, the Beings all around me were ripping and tearing at me. I was thinking that I didn't like this at all and wanted to go back.  
    Probable NDE due to suicide attempt with medication overdose.  Hellish experience.     

        4402.      Michael Probable NDE       10/8/2017.        Probable NDE 8391.                Implicit in this realization of love between the masculine and feminine divinity was a sort of inherent knowledge, or knowledge inherent in the resonance of that love, or you could just call it a sense. The tension between the masculine and feminine divinity or divinities combined was what created the manifest universe. All of the existent universe was an act of love for this feminine energy to return to this masculine energy. Behind all the manifest world was this deepest yearning to return to each other. That's what time is. That's what being finite is. That's what every conscious Being somehow embodies. Separation caused that tension. But at the same time, there was a simultaneous reality of them always being in union. This reunion was always taking place and eternally achieved.

To the second question if I had any regrets I answered, 'Yes.' Lying was not an option. I felt an overwhelming sense of peace that I've never experienced in my life.

His eyes were so deep. I felt that he could sent me lights of love. I wished to stay like that forever. It was the most amazing experience in my whole life! It was like he was taking me to heaven with him and I was happy to follow him.

This presence spoke to me without words and invited me to stay a while in this place. I responded angrily because I didn't want to stay there with him. This presence then punched me and I began to fall to some truly horrible places. I passed through at least three horrible places that were horrendous and strange. I was still angry, so yelled so the presence could hear me, 'I am not frightened! Is that all you have got?' I passed through a battle where the bodies were shredded like a pulp of bones and blood. The second place was like a desert of ice, with a violet Sun overhead. The final place was like a volcano erupting.

I could see them poking, prodding, and examining me. I listened as they said, 'She's gone.' It was late at night and the attending doctor didn't have the necessary signing authority for the time-of-the-death certificate. They called for an authorized person to sign. I watched as my body was wiped off with some of the gore as everyone else stood quietly waiting. I think about 15 minutes passed. Then a woman with red hair entered.

I lingered in the air between the trees above my body.

The window was very small when it first appeared, but grew while the wheels were spinning and making a high pitch noise. The window would grow rather quickly and then consume me. I would be inside the window of that reality. As soon as that window was done showing me things, another reality window appeared. It was growing and make that loud sound, just like the previous window. Each window that appeared, had different contents inside but they all had the same theme. This was Creation! When the window would absorb me, there would be nothing there. Within seconds, things grew, things were built, and things were created.

I had a feeling of extreme happiness, unmatched peace, and a feeling of universal love. I think I was in this state for about 45 minutes. I didn't see anyone in the light but I experienced happiness as I had never felt before.

            4383.      Heidi C NDE      8/12/2017.        NDE 8354.   The light was the most beautiful white, golden light. I felt immense happiness, contentment, peace, warmth and love. The light was bubbly, sparkling and effervescent, like champagne. There are no words to really express or articulate how I felt or to describe the beautiful light and warmth that I was bathed in. The colors and feelings were a million times magnified.

I started to feel a state of ecstasy and relaxation. It was as if I was coming out of my body and going through an illuminated tunnel. I said mentally, 'MY GOD, WHAT IF I SHOULD DIE FIGHTING? I JUST ASK GIVE ME STRENGTH FOR MY LITTLE CHILDREN.' in a moment, I felt a strong impact on my body at the moment when my soul returned to my body. I felt liberated from the tangle of parachute cords, and again despaired of reaching the surface. I felt like I was drowning and drinking water. Then I started to see the clarity of the surface.
      NDE from drowning after the plane ejection.       

            4381.        Marilyn L FDEs         8/9/2017.          FDEs 8352.                    At first, the tunnel was very large and it sounded like a freight train. Something or someone was in there with me. I think I was frightened, but now I wonder if I am only frightened remembering it. The tunnel started to narrow like a funnel and I felt like I was headed for a destination.  
      SOBEs vs Fear-Death Experiences at two times during her life, at age 10 and 22.  Once during a hurricane and one during a pulmonary embolus.

I saw the first flash of light 2-3 m before the center barrier. It was like somebody was taking picture of me.Then came memory of recent time, another flash another memory. It was backwards in time towards the past. All the memories- when I had good times, felt lucky in love then back to scholl, kindergarden. All the friend , all family members, nature.It was about 15 to 20 flashes and one of the last one was how somebody (like in the fog)is standing above me in stroller. Then last flash and a tunnel.

Running through the trees was something that looked like a cross between a Yak and an Orangutan - a huge muscular animal charging quickly by itself through the wild. I'm then shown more and more other places, some remarkable and some unremarkable. I realise just how huge the universe is. Earth is just a tiny part of an endless world.
        Exceptional and remarkably transcendent NDE due to severe illness.

            4377.        Helen S STE         7/30/2017.          STE 8347.            Exceptional experience.         I noticed as I looked out the window that I was one with the blades of grass and the rocks in the road. I was enveloped in a love I could not put into words. This divine love was in everything and in me. At the core of my being, I was this love and so was everyone else. In this state of grace, there was no right or wrong, no good or bad, and no judgment whatsoever. Fear was non-existent. There was no death and I knew that we all live forever. Everyone I met was love.   
      Remarkably profound STE.       

            4376.        Zdenka M FDE         7/29/2017.          FDE 23235.           From Slovenia.         The windshield turned milky, bright white. The inside of the car was absent of any sound, any movement or change. It was like I was spinning in the white room. I felt the spinning of the car, but nothing else was moving. It was like I would spin in one spot. As much as I felt, the car should have made at least three full spins around itself. But all I could see outside was this white surrounding; no road, no other cars, nothing else. I can't say how long this lasted, maybe five seconds, ten seconds, or twenty seconds. I wouldn't know as there was no orientation on that, but it did seem like prolonged time of spinning and staring in white and waiting for the impact.

They were my deceased mother, grandmother and dog. We exchanged hellos. I remember feeling sheer joy and excitement and wanting to hug them. I couldn't see myself, but as I moved to touch them, they said that I must not do that as they backed away. No words were exchanged with our mouths, only telepathically.

                  4374.        James NDE         7/29/2017.          NDE 8344.                    And then suddenly, I was outside of my body floating in a semi-conscious state. I was completely content and was not struggling anymore. In fact, I was unbelievably happy and felt like I was enveloped by a loving presence. There was no time, just the experience of the moment with no future or past.

After waking up, I had a strong sensation of a motherly love that had been given to me. I had never experienced anything like that. I also have a lingering memory of a giant, white circle and how my deceased mother and brother were standing behind it. I couldn’t go on the other side of that circle.

The love there was so intense.  I never wanted to leave. The plasma Love Light angels, grabbed my love light soul and hauled me away by force to my dead body.  
      NDE at age 7 due to complications following surgery.  Was on way to morgue when recovered.       

            4371.        Stacy K NDE         7/24/2017.          NDE 8341.                    Then I felt another shift. I was in, what looked to me, like outer space. It was dark, but not black. I sensed that this place was vast beyond definition, and cracklingly alive with energy. God was by my right side and waves of overwhelming, warm, loving, and unconditional acceptance enveloped me. I felt God's pure, absolute and dignified love. I clearly comprehended my situation. I understood that every moment of my life is governed by my own free will.  
      NDE due to stroke.       

            4370.        Laetitia V NDE         7/24/2017.          NDE 8339.           From France.  Original in French, translated to English by Marguy.         I entered the light without any fear. While I continued my way in this light, a silhouette came from above and blocked the way to the light by coming in front of me. I was surprised to see my whole, difficult life scrolling before me and I said, 'I don't want to relive this, life is too hard." And I started crying. The silhouette told me 'It's only up to you to change things, you can help many people as your soul is pure. You are needed on earth.'  
      NDE from surgery complications.       

            4369.        Karen H NDE         7/24/2017.          NDE 8336.                    All of a sudden, I was very far away and in a tunnel that was swirling Darkness. Yet, it felt just as it was fit for me. I was not scared. I saw a bright light, way far away. I turned around and saw myself lying on the floor. My husband was crying and yelling my name over and over again. I seemed to be really far away from my body. I wasn't floating upward or anything, I was just in one place in tunnel. It lasted a few minutes.
      NDE due to alcohol overdose.       

            4368.        Virginie R NDE         7/24/2017.          NDE 8334.           Exceptional Archive.  From France.  Original in French, translated to English by Marguy.         I was advancing towards a very bright, white light at the end of a tunnel. My little brother Philippe, who died 12 years before, took me by the hand and was smiling at me while taking me in front of the light.             A strong, but not nasty voice, asked me why I wanted to die. I answered that the absence of my little brother was too hard for me, and that my mother felt resentful towards me because of Philippe's death.  
      NDE due to suicide attempt.       

            4367.        Xue-Mei C NDE         7/24/2017.          NDE 8326.           Exceptional Archive. From China.  Original in Chinese, translated to English by Jenny.         Instantaneously, I was no longer in the lengthy, dark tunnel. Alternatively, I was in a bright, warm, and pure world. I was completely relieved, no more agonies, but instead replaced with eternal peace and bliss. My spirit asked one question after another, regarding the true colors of the universe and about life and death. Wherever my conscious went, he unfolded the answers before my eyes. This world was made up of particles. When microparticles accumulated, it formed a world with thousands of collective representations, meaning specific images. 
      Remarkable non-Western NDE from mainland China.       

            4366.        Hana P Possible NDE         7/20/2017.          NDE 8333.           From Czech Republic         I had a vision of a gray area with many scattered boards and beams. At the top right is a circular light, which had an incredibly bright center that was inviting me to enter. Suddenly I realized with horror that it was the transition between life and death. I said, 'I do not want to enter. I have not tried everything in my life.'  
      Possible NDE due to pneumonia.       

                  4365.        Paul C Possible NDEs         7/18/2017.          Possible NDEs 8332.           From Canada         I might have had a life review. It was as if I was in a graphic novel where I was crashing through one picture and into another by going through the walls of each picture. I was out of my body and speedily traveling through the hallways of the hospital.   
      Possible NDE as an infant, and another possible NDE associated with appendicitis and surgery at age 37.       

            4364.        Judy G NDE         7/15/2017.          NDE 8329.                    I was asked, 'Do you want to continue this life, or die?' I thought, 'What's death?' The Light began to show me. I knew without a doubt that death was not an ending, but a wonderful opening to my real life. I would be more knowledgeable and live in unconditional completeness and love. I remember feeling almost unworthy of such an indescribable, unconditional love. I was in awe of how much love was enveloping me.  
      NDE due to auto accident while pregnant.  Shared 51 years later.       

            4363.        John D NDE         7/15/2017.          NDE 8328.                    The next thing I remember was hovering about 10 feet in the air over my body. I saw my supervisor holding my head in his lap. I heard a ambulance coming into the park and my supervisor screaming for get it to get over here, saying, 'He hasn't been breathing for several minutes!' Then I remember being in a place that was foggy, but not foggy. Hard to explain. It had no defined borders or colors. I was in a sense of peace, with no pain, and a feeling of it's o.k. I remember thinking that I wasn't breathing. Yet, I felt no panic. 
      NDE due to head trauma.  Was apparently felt to be dead by medical team and covered with sheet.       

            4362.        Seth C NDE        7/10/2017.          NDE 8325.                    Than I met my best friend who I had wanted to see for so long. It was Jesus! I just knew it. Even though he didn't say my name, I didn't ask his either. It was like we always knew each other and he loved me so much! All the information and communication we had was telepathic and instantaneous. I do remember arguing with him at the end, not in a bad way, but saying, 'Please don't send me back there!'
        NDE due to heart attack.       

            4361.        Zenaida NDE         7/6/2017.          NDE 8324.           Originally from the Dominican Republic.         I could see a golden light far in the distance it got closer and closer bigger and bigger till i was at the point pf collision with it and bang! Like the sparks from a fire cracker i crash into what felt like a swimming pool filled with love instead of water. Then suddenly i felt like i was teleported to this gigantic hall that seem like grand central station in Manhattan but 100 times bigger. This place was filled what seem to be billions of people in white robes. People of all races ethnicities gender and ages. There was a feeling of love that reverberated through every one and a song that played endlessly a song that's too perfect to describe.  
      NDE due to faint and head injury.       

            4360.        Ceire C Possible NDE        7/4/2017.          Possible NDE 8323.            From Ireland.         I remember going to a wooden house. There was a strong sun setting in the evening. I went into the house and there was no furniture inside. There were no windows inside, just the outside frames of the windows. I floated upstairs and was going out the top window. Before I could leave, they asked me if I wanted to stay or go.

One by one, the hurt, anger, and all negative feelings fell off of me.  There was such a peaceful and sweet feeling that I cannot put into words.  I begged them to let me continue on, but they said I had to go back because I wasn't done yet. I started to fall.  As I did so, all those feelings came back onto me one by one.
        Possible NDE due to suicide attempt.

I saw a brilliant blue-white light. It had the illusion of a circle that kept growing. It got bigger and bigger. Suddenly, the circle opened up and I could see clearly into the open circle. Standing in that circle were my musician idols; Leo Fender and Les Paul. I felt intense peace and a sense of being welcome that I never experienced on earth. 
      NDE due to electrocution.       

            4357.        Beth S Possible NDE         7/1/2017.          Possible NDE 8317.                    It was as if no time was going on but everything was happening at once. I remember seeing my mom, who had passed 7 years prior, and her telling me if wasn't my time. We seemed go back and forth for a little bit. I felt so good.

There was a very pretty river to my left, and an interesting desert to my right. I kept walking near the river and turned to look at it. Across the river was a river beach. Beyond the beach was an incredible forest. I tried to see the sun, but couldn't turn around. I kept walking and began to ask myself how thirsty I would be later in the walk. I kneeled to drink from the river. As I got water in my hand and almost to my mouth, I heard a voice. It said, 'Don't drink that!' It was the same voice from the first NDE.   
      Two NDEs.  One due to suicide attempt and the other due to complications after being shot.
