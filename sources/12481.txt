  		              		Experience Description 8664:   

    I was on my way back to our town, when I started having a seizure. I found myself in a very vast and dark place, but I still could see. I was not aware of my body anymore. I asked a lot of questions, like where am I and how I came here? But there was no answer. Then I realized that there is a void under me as well because  I was not standing on anything. I mean the feeling we have on Earth that there is always something under your feet. That feeling was not there. Then I saw a very beautiful light that was shining on me even though it was  far away from me. My surroundings and environment were still dark. In a strange way I received this understanding that everything will be all right. Suddenly, I opened my eyes and saw that I was on a hospital bed.

  Experience Description 8558:   

    My family and I were  travelling to my hometown. It was a car trip in the middle of summer with no air-conditioning. I started to feel sleepy, so I laid my head on my aunt's lap. My parents noticed that I had an absence seizure and had stopped breathing. 

  I don't remember if I was looking at my own body. But I do remember being in a cave-like place. It was so dark. I thought it was odd that  I was  standing on nothing. I asked so many questions but no one answered.  I remember wondering if it was a prison or something.  I was so confused. Then, I saw a bright light at the end of this place. The light was very pleasant and  I stopped worrying about where I was or what was going to happen. 

   Then I was  jolted back into my body. I was in the hospital and seeing the faces of my freaked-out parents. A few months later, I began hearing sounds echoing in my mind.  I don't know who it was but it was helping me in my math problems at school.  The sounds didn't allow me to sleep at night. I was so scared and no one ever believed me.  I begged the voice to stop talking and it did. Now I regret that,  but now it's too late.
