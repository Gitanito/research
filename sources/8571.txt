  ABSTRACT:&nbsp;      From near death experience research, a model that fits the data is that   consciousness (synonymous to soul) is a fourth dimensional construct.&nbsp; This   concept necessarily affects the way we view time and how we integrate   consciousness with our three dimensional, earth reality.&nbsp; Our science, religion,   and society are all affected by how we perceive our earth reality.&nbsp; This paper   attempts to explain the fourth dimension by analogizing to one, two, and three   dimensional concepts to what NDErs are telling us about their fourth dimensional   experiences.

As I sit here on this   windy, rainy day, I have much to think about after reading the book by A.T.   Schofield, M.D. published in 1888.[1]   &nbsp;Dr.   Schofield takes the analogies of one, two and three-dimensional worlds and then   theorizes on how to conceive of a fourth dimension.&nbsp; Interestingly, he also   draws analogies on how entities living in the first, second and third dimensions   would religiously view entities from other dimensions.&nbsp; Ultimately, the   discussion is a scientific glimpse of the fourth dimension through the eyes of   spirit.&nbsp; One can easily see that NDEs, typically described as profoundly   spiritual experiences, are glimpses of the fourth dimension and perhaps not so   far removed from science as we normally think.&nbsp;

What this paper will   do is to delve into the fourth dimension by using examples from one, two, and   three-dimensional worlds.&nbsp; Altered states of consciousness are explored as a   possible avenue to understanding the different dimensions.&nbsp; Social and religious   implications of the different scenarios are discussed.&nbsp; Lastly, the fourth   dimension is reviewed in terms of what we observe from studying the near death   experience (NDE) and the out of body experience (OBE).&nbsp; Of necessity, a new   paradigm is presented that uses observations from the fourth-dimensional medium.

Physical   Constructs from One, Two, and Three Dimensional Worlds

One of the most   helpful things to understanding the fourth dimension is to visualize   other dimensions using common, every day items.&nbsp; It then makes it easier to   understand the analogy between the third dimensional world and the fourth by   using this method.&nbsp; For me, common items consisted of office supplies.&nbsp; An   unfolded paper clip could represent a line.&nbsp; A pencil is also a good   representation of a line.&nbsp; A piece of paper can be used to represent a   two-dimensional plane.&nbsp; The paper I used was initially part of a sticky-note   pad.&nbsp; The third dimension can be easily represented by using the sticky-note pad   because the two dimensional paper then has the added dimension of thickness.&nbsp; A   ream of paper or a tablet of paper can serve the same function.

Now, visualize   yourself as a being inside of the paperclip.&nbsp; You are free to move back and   forth, but can only see others in the line as a point.&nbsp; Next, take the piece of   paper and imagine yourself as being on that paper.&nbsp; You can see four lines.&nbsp;   But, then if you view the piece of paper as a three-dimensional being, the piece   of paper has two sides (a top and a bottom) that are not necessarily realized   when viewing the note from a two-dimensional perspective.&nbsp;

Another way to look   at this would be to imagine that the two-dimensional being resided on the   surface (plane) of the water in a tub or a sink; Then imagine moving a ball   closer to the surface of the water.&nbsp; At first, there would be intersection in   the form of a point when the ball first touched the water.&nbsp; The point would then   turn into a circle, necessarily changing size as the ball started to submerge   beneath the surface of the water.

A two-dimensional   being might be able to conceive of a third-dimension.&nbsp; However, most in the   two-dimensional world would find it futile unless they had a construct such as   mathematics.&nbsp; Although the mathematical proof would be there, it is still hard   to conceive of other dimensions since there is no visual imagery or verbal   language constructs within our three dimensional world to fit other, higher   dimensional models.&nbsp;

The two-dimensional   being would never be able to comprehend the existence of the sphere by viewing   it from the two-dimensional realm because all that could be perceived is a   curved line.&nbsp; However, if the being abstracted the thought process and   understood mathematics, he might be able to extrapolate that the line forms a   circle.&nbsp; He could walk around the circle to understand its existence, but would   never be able to view the whole circle at once.

There are two ways   that the two dimensional being could understand the total reality of the piece   of paper in relation to other dimensions of existence.&nbsp; One, is to be taken out   of the two-dimensional world so that the piece of paper could be viewed from all   angles, including the top and the bottom of the paper; Or two, the sphere could   try to communicate with the two-dimensional being and explain the greater   reality.&nbsp; For the two-dimensional being to advance in personal understanding,   communication would necessarily imply that the two-dimensional being is open   enough to hear of other worlds, or had the ability to alter his state of   consciousness to experience the three-dimensional world on a first-hand basis.

In my mind, I   conceptualize another dimension in terms of the sticky-note pad.&nbsp; I can take the   piece of paper on the top and wrap it around until it touches the bottom of the   last piece of paper.&nbsp; I then have a circular slice of what could be a smaller   portion of a cone or a sphere shape.&nbsp; I can imagine an infinite number of two   dimensional pieces of paper within this circular slice as they radiate from the   center where the glue attaches the individual papers together.&nbsp;

To convert the image   to a three dimensional concept, I make the square pieces of paper into a round   shape so it resembles a sphere.&nbsp; Then I can imagine an infinite number of three   dimensional slices of paper aligned in an infinite number of angles or different   axis radiating from the center.&nbsp; Each alignment of the paper would represent a   different three dimensional reality.&nbsp; In order to convert the third dimensional   representation into a fourth dimensional reality, you would string an infinite   number of three dimensional spheres together.&nbsp; Conventional wisdom tells us that   the fourth dimension represents time.&nbsp; So, instead of the spherical three   dimensional balls being strung together in a spatial alignment using depth as   the common denominator; we would use the backdrop of time to string the three   dimensional balls together.&nbsp;

Social and   Communication Constructs of other Dimensions.

There are many   aspects to social constructs that arise from physically understanding other   dimensions.&nbsp; What we observe in our third dimensional world is that ideology   changed as the religious dogma incorporated new ideas of our relationship to the   universe around us.&nbsp; At certain times in our three-dimensional history, it was a   novel concept that earth was not the center of the universe, that the earth was   not flat, or that other larger galaxies and smaller worlds consisting of   microbes and viruses exist.&nbsp; The church, after realizing that it couldn't   suppress the new discoveries, backed down on denouncing and persecuting the   heretic individuals.&nbsp; The world of established science had also ridiculed people   such great thinkers as Galileo, Kelvin, Pasteur, Lister, Jenner, Edison and Einstein   (Schmicker, 2000).&nbsp;   They said that it was ludicrous to say that creatures, forces, or particles   existed that we couldn't see, or to think that whole cities could be lit with   electricity.&nbsp; Our world has been revolutionized by the inventions promulgated by   these discoveries.&nbsp; We can now conceive of possible other worlds in other   galaxies, fight diseases, and travel the seven seas without falling off the edge   of the world.&nbsp;

Consider what would   happen if a person shaped as a three-dimensional sphere wanted to become visible   to the two-dimensional being.&nbsp; The three-dimensional sphere would necessarily be   invisible until she placed herself into the exact plane where the   two-dimensional can see her.&nbsp; It goes without saying that, from our   third-dimensional viewpoint, we would consider it closed-minded for the   two-dimensional being to say that we or the sphere-being do not exist because we   are invisible to the two dimensional being.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Another concept is   that the two-dimensional being would not have scientific proof unless one from   the three-dimension directly intersects with the two-dimensional field of   vision.&nbsp; This would be an arbitrary process unless the third-dimensional being   was willing to cooperate in being studied or the two-dimensional being had   reliable mastery over transcending the limitations of the two-dimensional   world.&nbsp; Partial mastery would score as misses because the two-dimensional being   could end up on other pieces of paper in the sticky-note stack; analogous to   entering other two-dimensional realities.&nbsp; It would be far easier for a two-   dimensional being to talk about other two-dimensional planes and relate that   experience to other two-dimensional beings, than it would be to enter and   explain the third-dimensional reality to two-dimensional beings.&nbsp;

It is interesting   that Dr. Schofield speculated that communication would come from hearing those   in the fourth dimension, not with physical ears, but from within the self.&nbsp;   Communication as described in NDEs is virtually always telepathic.&nbsp; Another   wonderful insight was that the reaction of the person residing in the paperclip   or pencil line would not believe the communication with the person on the paper   plane.&nbsp; Because of the lack of understanding of the two-dimensional world, the   line person would consider the experience mystical and attribute it to religious   figures.&nbsp; In integrating the experience, the line person could: 1) shut the   experience out and pretend it didn't happen, 2) privately continue to learn from   the plane person, or 3) try to communicate the experience to other line persons   and risk ridicule and/or suppression of the newly discovered reality.

Another important   concept is that ideological beliefs of the line person may have pre-existing   religious boundaries incompatible with two-dimensional reality.&nbsp; For instance,   there might be a pre-existing belief system that reinforces the status quo by   saying it is a sin or it is work of the devil to believe anything other than   what is taught by the line church.&nbsp; Another example could be a religious-based   misconception of the nature of the extra dimension.&nbsp; Here, a religious belief of   the line person may be that God created the line person in his own image.&nbsp;   Thereby, all types of moral constraints are attached to God based on the fact   that he intended us to be like him.&nbsp; However, as three-dimensional beings, we   can see that the line person's conception of God leaves out the third dimension   of depth of what God's image would look like to us.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The moral constraints are   independent social constructs to maintain order in the line person's world, yet   attributed to God as the ultimate authority.&nbsp;

Just as the preceding   section discusses aspects of dimensions between one, two, and three dimensional   worlds, we can analogize our three dimensional world to that of the fourth (or   greater) dimensions.&nbsp; Mathematically, we can prove many other dimensions and   computer extrapolate what they might look like.&nbsp;

Because of the lack   of understanding of the two-dimensional world, the line person would consider   the experience mystical and attribute it to religious figures.&nbsp; From there, the   line person could: 1) shut the experience out and pretend it didn't happen, 2)   privately continue to learn from the plane person, or 3) try to communicate the   experience to other line persons and risk ridicule and/or suppression of the   newly discovered reality.

In sum, the way we   physically construct our world has profound implications as to how we order   society.&nbsp; We perceive our reality based upon time-honored ideologies that may   not be valid when viewed from a different paradigm.&nbsp; What science and religion   may demand as proof of the fourth dimension may be skewed according to social   norms and social constructs.&nbsp; Only by thinking outside of the three-dimensional   box will be able to advance in consciousness and to understand our true nature.&nbsp;   That being said, let us turn our attention to what a fourth dimension might look   like to three dimensional beings, like ourselves.

The Fourth   Dimension

We become aware of   the fourth (or greater) dimensions, first by what we can mathematically   abstract: secondly, by anomalies we observe on earth when those of other   dimensions choose to intersect with our particular three dimensional earth   reality: and thirdly by the observation and personal experiences of others who   talk of the particular ability of the soul to transcend across the various   dimensions.&nbsp;

The mathematical   extrapolations have been done and there are many good articles on the internet   and some even have pictures.&nbsp; We know that the fourth dimension exists in   theory, just as the two dimensional person could theorize about the lines of a   circle.&nbsp;

There is a wide range   of human experiences that fit into the category of spiritually transformative   events.&nbsp; Many attribute this to genuine religious experiences, while many others   discount the experiences as work of the devil or a medically sick mind.&nbsp; Given   the way that a one or two dimensional being would react to us, it is   understandable how three dimensional beings would view an interaction from a   fourth (or greater) dimensional being.&nbsp; Furthermore, we would hear a fourth   dimensional being in our mind and would not necessarily be aware of their   existence unless that being chose to interact with us.&nbsp; Interaction could only   occur by intersecting our world in our waking or a state of altered   consciousness.&nbsp; That does not mean that failure to intersect with us means the   fourth dimensional being does not exist.&nbsp; It also may be part of the reason why   many clinical studies fail.&nbsp; There could be a component co-creation that is   necessary with the other side's cooperation in order for us to be able to   understand the fourth dimension.&nbsp;

We have observed that   humans can enter into altered states of consciousness.&nbsp; The near death   experience (NDE) is defined as, 'the reported memory of all impressions during   the special state of consciousness, including specific elements such as   out-of-body experience, pleasant feelings, and seeing a tunnel, a light,   deceased relatives, or a life review' (van Lommel (2001). &nbsp;Although there is no   clear consensus of what constitutes a NDE, there are specific patterns of events   that a person lucidly recalls that happened at or near the time of clinical   death (Long, 2002).&nbsp;

Moreover, out of body   experiences (OBE) are common during NDE.&nbsp; An OBE can be defined as an experience   in which a person seems to perceive the world from a location outside of the   physical body (French, 2001, p. 2010).&nbsp; A person is in an altered state of   consciousness during an OBE.&nbsp; The one thing that is missing from this definition,   distinguishing OBEs from psychotic events, is the lucid nature of the OBE   (Long, 2002).&nbsp; The out of body experience is a fairly common phenomenon since it occurs   in 14-34% of the population depending on which study you look at.&nbsp; It would be   ludicrous to say that up to one third of the human population are mental illness   deviants:&nbsp; When in fact, this is such a common phenomena.&nbsp;&nbsp;

NDEs and OBEs are   analogous to the changing states of consciousness that enabled the two   dimensional being to transcend and be able to comprehend our three dimensional   world.&nbsp; By changing the state of consciousness, the being was free to see the   top or the bottom of the piece of paper instead of just lines in a plane.

What is commonly   reported during NDEs and OBEs is that sense perception is vivid and enhanced,   colors vibrant, sounds are alive, time is very different on the other side,   there is unconditional love, communication is all-knowing, and we are all   interconnected with one another (Long, 2002).&nbsp; One cannot help but wonder if the   common scientific explanation of time as the fourth dimension variable is a   misconception.&nbsp; In reality, the fourth dimension may be spatially related to us   through our interconnections with each other.&nbsp; NDErs and some OBErs are able to   glimpse a world held together by unconditional love as a matrix for   communication, a way of life, and total knowledge.&nbsp; Time may only represent a   small part of the connection matrix of the fourth dimension.&nbsp;

Crucial to our   understanding of the fourth dimension would be an open mind to the communication   we receive from the fourth dimension.&nbsp; As with our communication with a two   dimensional being, it would be necessary for us to distinguish between social   constraints and concepts as presented from the fourth dimension.&nbsp; This means   that religious dogma, and scientific obstinacy would need to be temporarily   suspended for true understanding to occur.&nbsp;

When the mind is in   altered states of consciousness, NDErs and OBErs report that there is a part of   the body that is capable of experiencing other dimensions.&nbsp; The most extreme   observation is the NDE where consciousness survives death.&nbsp; The fact that   consciousness can transcend our earthly reality, may mean that consciousness   itself is not confined to this particular three dimensional reality which is   unlike our physical bodies.&nbsp; If consciousness were actually part of a fourth (or   greater) dimension, then our social structure would change based upon the truths   of the greater reality.&nbsp;

For instance, our   individual consciousness could be described analogous to the fourth dimensional   sphere that intersects our earthly plane.&nbsp; That fourth dimensional sphere only   has one slice of itself that intersects with the water surface at one instance   in time.&nbsp; Therefore, it would not be unreasonable to assume that a fourth   dimensional soul would also have the same capability analogous to the sphere.&nbsp;

From our earthly   viewpoint, we could see the phenomena in terms similar to reincarnation.&nbsp;   However, from the fourth dimensional view, it would look like one soul   intersecting with several slices of paper at the same time. What the soul   personifies as one being intersecting at one point in time in our physical   reality, can essentially be several beings intersecting at different points in   time.&nbsp; Yet, all the beings are part of the same soul experience.&nbsp; What one being   necessarily does at any point along that time line, would affect the other   beings backwards and forwards in time because they are all interconnected as   part of the same stream of consciousness.&nbsp;

The observed pattern   of NDEs is that unconditional love is the universal language in the third and   fourth (or greater) dimensions.&nbsp; This also appears to be part of the universal   matrix that ties dimensions together.&nbsp; Many people who read the NDE accounts to   conceptualize what the fourth dimension holds are likely to be frustrated.&nbsp; It   would be hard to understand what the fourth dimension is about until we truly   understand the common language of unconditional love.&nbsp; This requires tolerance,   patience, and teaching others in their own language so they truly understand   unconditional love.&nbsp; We can then develop the interconnected language to   understand what is next in our evolution as one of God's cherished creations.&nbsp;   We also need the wisdom and humility to understand that no single person will   have the answer, be it a scientist or a spiritualist.
