TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL NOTICE, 1841.
RAPHAEL continues to receive from all parts eulogistic ap
proval of his labours. Thesale last year mach increased, and
RAPHAEL's industry has been prompted to make it still more
usefuland interesting. Theuninitiated in the art of book-printing
would be astonished were they to know the expense of getting out
a work , small in appearance, but containing so many figures and
calculations; in truth, it is only theextensive circulation which
RAPHAEL'S PROPHETIC ALMANAC maintains which remune
ratesauthor and publisher. The work (established twenty-one
years) requires much care and attention to understanditproperly ;
but,when this difficulty is conquered, our readers become ena.
moured with the subject, fascinated with its contents,and recom .
mend it to their friends. Copiesfor former years can behad to
complete sets.

“ Yemanytwinkling stars, who yet do bold
Your brilliant places in the sable vault
Of night's dominions! Planets, and central orbs
or other systems,big as theburning sun
Wbich lights this nether globe- yet to our eye
Small as the glow -worm 's lamp- to you I raise
My lowly ori ons, wbile, all bewilder'd ,
Myvision strays'o'er your etbereal bosts,
Too vast, too boundless, for our narrow mind,
Warp'd with low prejudices, to unfold
And sagely comprehend. Tbence higher soaring ,
Through you I raisemy solemn thoughts to Him ,
The mighty Founder of this wondrous maze
The GREAT CREATOR!"
EST MODUS IN REBU'S, SUNT CERTI DENIQUE FINES, QUOS
OLTRA CITRAQUE NEQUIT CONSISTERE RECTUM . - To all
things there is a limit and a boundary : the inscrutable de
crees of Providence are shrouded by a dense and mysterious
veil,which it is not the destiny of man to rend asunder or
penetrate. Further than this, it is written , “ we may not
pass" - the dread beyond is, to us, who are sojourners in this
finite sphere, a chaos.
With the limited knowledge that is permitted to us,we will
endeavour,as far as we may, to read the fate of the present
year,and scan the destiny of man.
In this inonth Mars opposes the ascendant of England,
andmeets the quadrate rays ofMercury and the Sun. States.
men be cautious! Warriors prepare! for the shrill notes of
the fife may be heard, and the warlike sound of the battle
truinpet. Dying groans will float on the wind ; for the how
rizon is red with crackling fire. Rumours are afloat of some
deep system of deceit or Treason. Libels and scurrilous
writings abound, in which Government is vilified. Misfor.
tune bangs over the head of a Senator. One ofLiterary or
Legal fameis afflicted.
In Spain there are fearful proceedings, both as regards the
Church and State. The Cabinet of Vienna is in turmoil, and
prepares forwar. The Eastern Territories are disturbed --
the Crescent shines but dimly. Strangematters, as regards
a Lady of Quality, will comebefore the public. A Military
Man is afflicted. A brilliant Star in the galaxy of Fashion is :
laid low by the dart of Death . Fires, Robberies, and In
juries to buildings will be frequent.

FOR FEBRUARY,1841.
“ Genius of musings, who, the midnigbt bour
Wasting in woods or baunted forests wild,
Dost watch Orion in bis arctic tower,
Thy dark eye fixed as in some holy crance ;
Orwben the vollied ligbtningscleavetbe air,
And ruin gaunt bestrides the winged storm ,
Sie'st in some lonely watcb-tower, where thy lamp,
Faintblazing, strikes the fisher's eye from far,
And, 'mid the howlof elements,unmoved,
Dost ponder on the awful scene, and trace
The vast effect to its superior source."
The Month is ushered in with aspects of evil import to
the Fair Sex . Ye who have basked in the world of fashion !
ye who have been as worshipped idols to the multitude,
beware ! The destroyer comes with stealthy and advancing
step ; the blow is, alas! too sure, the sorrow most poignant !
As we pass onwards in the labyrinth of time, we behold a
Scholar and a Clergyman ; laurels appear hanging o'er their
heads. A grey-haired Warrior wields a sabre ; it flashes
brightly.
Spain holdssome communication with England on warlike
matters. The politics of our own country appear in a very
unsettled state, and many of themovements of Government
have a tendency to war, Much debating and correspondence
ensueswith foreign powers regarding affairs in which Portugal
and Egypt hold a prominent part. The public excitement
becomes general, and there is much discontent. All things
connected with the metropolis wear a disagreeable aspect.
Business is depressed , large failures occur, the stocks and
monied interests vibrate alarmingly. Affairs connected with
the Church occasion much public irritation, and doinestic
scandal in high life abounds. A Marriage of eclat occurs.
One under the domination of Mercury is afflicted . Ove well
known as a Scientific Man and Writer departs this life. Our
Gallic neighbours are in a tumult - the French Cock crows
londly, and proves the old fable false . The Lion is not ter
rified. The passage of Mars through Scorpio will probably
cause some rising or disturbance in the Germanic States.
Gaze as we will on the page of futurity, the most prominent
aspects there, are those of war, strife, and contention. But to
wbat end can these doings tend ? Wherefore arises this strife
between man and man . Simply to raise the one above the
other, forgetfulof the nobler truths of humanity.

THE PREDICTIONS,
Timely Warnings, and Salutary Precepts ,
FOR MARCH , 1841.
“ Still on its march , unnoticed and unfelt,
Moves on ourbeing. Wedo liveand breathe,
And we are gone. Thespoilerbeedsus not.
Wehave our spring time and our rottenness ;
And as we fall, another race succeeds,
To perish likewise, Meanwhile nature smiles
The seasons run their round - the sun fulfils
His annual course, and beaven and earth reinain,
Still changing, yet unchanged - still doom 'd to feel
Endlessmutation in perpetual rest.
Where are concealed thedayswhich have elapsed ?
Hid in themigbtý cuvero of the past,
They rise upon us only to appal,
By indistinct andbalf-glimpsed images,
Misty, gigantic,buge, obscure, remote.”
Strike the high and solemn Dirge; letdeep funerealMusic
lend its melancholy cadence to the dipping oars of Charon,
while the Spirit bark glides over the dark waters of the
Stygian lake, guided by the grisly ferryman ; for the uim
forın, shrouded in a cold and murky drapery of gloom , was,
but a few fleet moments back , a mighty sceptred Potentate .
A Scholar follows in the shadowy train ; his fellow -tra
veller is a Prelate. Saturn enters his domal dignities in the
sign Capricorn. The Attic shores resound with fresh com
motions. The Star of classic Greece, for a while, illumines
the horizon , throwing round, as it were, a reflection of her
former glories. In that country the refinements of Art again
walk hand in handwith civilization, and for a period of thirty
months the Hellenic land owis the sway of its kindlier genius.
Extraordinary and important are the political negotiations
of both France and England ; they relate to Possessions
situated afar off; they breathe of hostile feelings,and America
appears concerned therein. Priestcraft raises many comino
tions in Spain, and proves a baneand curse to the People of
that infatuated country. Ireland gradually rises in the scale
of Nations; there appears a vast moralinprovement in the
character of the people, caused by some popular measure, or
produced by the excitement of National feeling. Death
seems busy in our own Land amongst the high and mighty,
the fair and gay. The retrograde motion ofMars in Scorpio
afflicts Italy, and in many of the Italian States causes disturb
ances of a revolutionary character. The monied interests of
England,her Colonies, and Commerce, are struggling under
baneful rays.

THE PREDICTIONS,
Timely warnings, and Salutary Precepts,
FOR APRIL , 1841.
We, from the bidden rolls of fate,
Unfold the destinies thatwait
Mycountry on the periloustrack,
W bence nations never voyageback
For onward is our mortal way,
Alike to glory or decay.”
In the course of this month Saturn turns retrograde in the
celestial sign Capricorn , a movement of malign import to
those Countries under the fearful sway of his direful power.
Troubles arise in the West India Colonies, movements of an
insurrectionary character take place, and commerce is neces
sarily injured. Part of Greece and Turkey likewise suffer
under this fatal influence. There are some extraordinary ,
political movements affecting the north of Egypt and Alex
andria ; France and Germany are also concerned in it. We
may expect some tidings of strange import regarding the
Sacerdotal and LegislativeGovernment of Spain. A Senator
and a Divine advance hand in hand on the road to fame.
There appears to be considerable domestic excitement con
cerning Corn -laws,Lands, Tithes, and allAgriculturalmatters,
in which public right will be asserted andmaintained bymany
an unflinching advocate. The passage of Mars is likely to
cast a malignantinfluence on the affairs of America and Por
tugal. He causes disturbances, and a vast deal of political
bickering. At home we shall have to deplore the death of
one of high and noble English blood - one famed “ in flood
and field." Let no unhallowed footstep disturb his calm and
dignified repose !
“ Siste,VIATOR ; Heroam CALCAS!"
The Drama thrives. Musical productions, remarkable for
genius and talent, are now brought before the public : and
much interest is excited by the success that crowns the efforts
of those among us learned in the Arts and Sciences. A Mar
riage between parties who have obtained much. publicity.
occurs. A Magistrate or Legislator appears to be the fa
vourite of fortune for a Meeting moment. New public build
ings of importance are commenced. Ireland claims a con
siderable share of the public attention ,and many political
measures connected with that country are carried into effect ;
but even these efforts are vain , for the evil star in the ascend
ant of Hibernia remains. She will not rise until England
falls ! and her doom is sealed and stamped with the signature
of Oculus Taurus.

" Such secret lore my soul doth yearn
From thy enchanted glass to learn
As erstwas taught that Rbymer bold ,
Who by fair Elfand's queen of old
Was captive led from Ei!doa tree
To this fuir land of faërie.”
Strange and eventfuldoes this Month appear. ThePowers
ofEurope gaze on with much anxiety. Political Debate runs
bigh. Anarchy stalks abroad, and changes and Revolutions
of differentGovernments take place. ThisMonth passesnot
over the heads of mortals without war and bloodshed : the
blue bosom of the Ocean is disturbed by the strife and con
tentions of men , Greece, Turkey, and the Indies are par
ticipators in the strife. England and France also bear their
part. Ainerica acts craftily, and seems to mimic the sinister
and tortuous policy of Russia . The political horizon of Spain
becomes clearer - intestine commotion appears for a timeto
cease ; still in that.devoted country priestcraſt holds its sway
with unabated strength . Adrerse 'rass appear to afflict the
Ottoman coast. Athomewe are astonished by many daring
acts of swindling or robbery. Commercial failures abound.
Much false news affecting commercial interests is given cir
culation to. One loug known in the Senate is disgraced or
dies. The Law Courts are occupied with trials of Conspiracies
against private character. What is that rising in Vision, re
presenting the plains of a far-off country ? It is the fearful
battle array,steeds and warriors intermixed - clashing cymbals
and rolling drums. The furies follow, and in their train
rapine, murder, pestilence, and carnage, the handmaids of
Bellona. Thus appeareth this appalling Vision
“ And they come on theplain, like drops of rain
Falling thick in a thunder-shower :
Butno footsteps' fall, no trumpet call,
Is heard through the sons of power.
The moon's last lightjust quivers white
On a harvest of helm and spear;
Butno eye of man can stretch from the van
Of tbat hostto the cloudy rear." .
The Inhabitants of our huge Metropolis will be horrified
with accounts of various robberies, fires, and tourders. One
well versed in foreign politics,and celebrated as a Diplomatist,
departsthis life. A Feinale,by means ofher exertions,attains
considerable notoriety. A youthſulGenius is afflicted. Ne
gotiations are entered upon with a Northern Power, and em .
bassies of importance arrive in Great Britain.

FOR JUNE, 1841.
" With austereand solemn look,
Such as none unmoved might brook,
Spoke the Fay : - Thou seek'st to scan
Knowledge all unnieet for man ;
But, since thou wilt, accept the boon
Which he who gains r-penteth soon.'
She said and sudden o’er theglass
Confused tbe frowning shadowspass,
With step reversed, as if they trod
Unwillingly a backward road.
* * * * * *
Fearfulwas the sightand high !
But on my lips a spelldoth lie ;
Themysteries of Elgin clime
May not be told withouta crime."
Aspects on Aspects rush and combine together ; surely
there is something about to be unfolded by the dark hand of
Destiny forMankind to stare and wonder at. Mercurytrines
Mars ; then advances to the opposition of Saturn ; nexthe
diverges to his greatest northern latitude from the Sun ; next
meets thesextile ray of Venus ; and, lastly, enters its southern
node. Lo ! there will be high and mighty morements of deep
political import exciting the Nations of theEarth from North
to South . A war of words, cabals, and protocols will take
place. Greece will be disturbed by risings in the Albanian
Provinces. One under the domination of Mercury writes
with great spirit and virulence againstexistingGovernments ;
another sinks beneath the influence of adverse rays. A
Lawyer or Clergyman is afflicted or disgraced. One under
the domination of Mars meets with Court favour. Some
recent Literary production is severely lampooned by the
Critics. One High and Mighty in the world , perhaps a Po
tentate, suffersstrangely, as if he were oppressed by a spell :
he sinks beneath the adverse aspects. A Marriage under
circumstances of singular eccentricity occurs. Throughout
the Month Spain appears greatly convulsed, Popery, with its
Jesuitical schemes, appearing the great promoter of all this
combustion. America is far from being tranquil. The
Mexican States are disturbed, and muinbers of petty Rulers
contend, onewith the other, for themastery of a few thousands
of miserable beings. Expect Disturbances in the Dutch and
Belgian Provinces. Constantinople is in a state of tumult.
The Crescent waving high on the Walls of Stamboul is
threatened, and the Mosque of Sophia may once again re
sound to the deep -toned bell of a Christian community.

" Oh ! ' is this beavenly harmonywhich now
In fancy strikesupon mylistening ear,
And tbrills my inmost soul. It bids me smile
On tbevain world and all its bustling cares,
· And gives a shadowy glimpse of future bliss.”
Saturn and Jupiter, in Sagittarius retrograde, oppose the
ascendant of London ; this will seriously affect the monied
interest, various Banks, the Stocks, the Treasury, large
Mercantile houses, and all places where monied transactions
are carried on. This influence continues for about the space of
six weeks; it will be most severely felt in trade generally,
and the failures that will occur from it will be truly calamitous.
Spain , Hungary, and manyof the northern provinces of Ger
many, are affected by it. One under thedomination of Mars
is rewarded for past services, and receives many tokens of
Royal favour. One under the domination of Mercury , and
who exercises his abilities with the Pen , rises to some pre
ferment. One connected with the Agricultural interests
meets with misfortune. The Royal bounty is extended to an
individual in a strange and unaccountablemanner. A Scho
liast or Clergyman is disgraced through the influence of a
female , while another rises in public estimation. One con
nected with the Medical profession or the Army suffers se
verely from the effect of Malignant Planetary rays. Fires
will be frequent; some large public warehouse, or depositary
for Government stores, will be injured . All kinds of cattle,
horses, and places for stabling ,are acted upon by the pervading
malific influence. This month there appears a fatality among
thehigher circles,many members of which depart this life.
Rumours are circulated concerning a Lady of quality. Some
reinarkable negotiations will take place between England and
theNorthern Powers,whose grasping ambition is checked for
a timeby the sagacious line of politics pursued by this country.
Egypt is in a state of considerable excitement. Sweden and
Denmark comein for their share of theplanetary configuration.
Policy assumes a curious aspect, and rumours of fresh con
tentions are not unlikely to occur at this period .
“ And on yonder cloud, like a mighty shroud,
Hurg o'er the lifeless earth ,
Are shifting bright,on thedazzled sight,
Strange scenes ofgriefand mirth,
Plays, battles, banquets in high halls
Wild plainswith corses strewed,
Kingscrowned,kingsstretcbed in funeral palls
Feasts, pageants, frenzy,blood.”

THE PREDICTIONS,

FOR AUGUST, 1841.
" I love to look on the rising sun,
When light and life from his beamsare shed ;
But better I love, when his race is run ,
The glory that circles bis golden bed .
Gladly I bail the Spring's returo,
: When earth is gay, and the heavensare bright,
Butmy heart still loves, though mine eyes may mourn ,
The fading glow of the Autumn light.”
· Still do the bright Orbs ofHeaven proceed in their wonted
course, forming theirmystic aspects. Still do the two great
Superiors retrograde through Sagittarius. Still does Spain
remain in an oppressed state ; the Catholic Countries ge
nerally are afflicted, and the evilrays, unhappily,are reflected
back upon our own Land. Commerce continues depressed ;
various Affairs concerning Customs, Excise , and Taxation , are
mooted, which give rise to much public discontent and remon
strance. Public Meetings of a political nature are numer
ous, assuming at times a menacing form and tone : some
popular demagogues arise, and, by their unbridled speech,
excite the fury of a bewildered multitude. The French Colony
of Algiers causesmuch trouble to itsGallic masters. Alexan
dria becomes the scene of many tumults, and Egypt generally
becomes the Theatre of inany stirring incideuts. Various
circumstances during the whole year portend war,not be
tween two countries only , but branching forth from one to
many. A tide in the order of events is approaching, which
will cause one or more Regions to change Rulers. Our do
mestic matters and home affairs are of a strange and peculiar
character. The Law Courts are occupied in discussions, in
which some Female of notoriety plays a distinguished part. A
Legislator or Clergyman is promoted ; a Martial Man is
attlicted ; a Lady of high connexions is vilified ,while another
sinks to rise no more : an elderly Statesman or Lawyer meets
with some promotion or favour. The town converse is prin
cipally concerning a curious circumstance connected with a
Medical Man , which, however, terminates to his credit. A
Marriage of note is on the tapis. SomeWorks of a peculiar
character emanate from the press. Strange doingsmay be
expected in the Italian States; there will be more talk of
deeds done in the Vatican and of Popery than there has been
for sometime past. I am fearfulthis Month will not pass by
without many Railroad accidents, and destructive losses by
fire; while Storms and high Gales at sea will causemany
Wrecks on our shores.

" There are momen's when all that has floated away
On the current of years, to ourvision comes back ;
And the formswhich once danced in the warm summer ray
Ofour life, shine again in mortality's track.
' TisMemory which gives to the memory ofman,
Halftbe joy that he feels, half the charms that invite ;
Like the rainbow , it glorifies all in its span ,
And gilds e'en the tempest with colours oflight.”'
Three Planets pass through the sign of the celestial Cen
taur; thetwanging of his bow islieard afar off, and high is the
flightofthe feathered missile. Woe to a Mighty One! a proud
Diadem sinks ; on one of Earth 's exalted Thrones there is a
vacancy,and the Fates frown while the Furies scowl in concert,
on the Successor. These strange movements of the Planetary
Orbs are but the harbingers of vast changes ; how far will
their dread power extend ? Itwould seem like theapproach of
somenew Era, some vastmutation, a change in the order of
existing Institutions; the Power and the Sceptre will pass
from the old stock , new Nations take their places, Colonies
become Empires, Empires Colonies : Nations noted in the
historic page pass away, and their Heroes and Statesmen
become the theme of antiquated legend and minstrel's roun
delay, who, in new -born Dynasties, shall record in their song
tales of the old land their forefathers sprung from . Deep
and mysterious are the incomprehensible workings of fate, and
far beyond the utınost reach of human intellect to penetrate.
Stillwemay perceive, even amidst the distantglimmering, that
these thingswillbe,although the Vision is cloudedandobscure.
" Where is Rome ?
She lives but in the tale of other times;
Her proud pavilions are the hermit's home:
Her long colonnades, her public walks,
Now faintly echo to the pilgrim 's feet,
Who comes to muse in solitude, and trace,
Through therank mossrevealed,herhonoured dust."
" Has Athens fallen ?
Is polishedGreecebecomethe savage seat
Of ignorance and sloth ?"
Too surely have these vast Nations thus passed away, and
their destruction may be regarded as nothing less than a type
of our own future Fate.
One of the Law is sorely vilified,another is lampooned. A
Literary character rises to some epliemeral importance, while
anotherdeparts this life. The Law lays its iron fangson one
connected with the press. The fleeting tenants ofa Coronet
and a Mitre pass to their long resting-place, theGrave.

“ Mild orb, who floatest tbro' the realm of night,
A patbless wanderer o’er a lonely wild,
Welcome to me thy soft and pensive light,
Which oft in childhood my love thoughts beguiled ;
Now doubly dear, as o'ermy silent seat
Nocturnal study 's still retreat,
It casts a mournfulmelancholy gleam ,
And thro'my lofty casementweaves,
Dim thro'tbe vines encireling leaves
An intermingled beam ."
Still are the oininous Three in Sagittary, and England's
Sons will have need to gird their loins for Battle. The
Demons ofwar and strife are abroad ; the enemies of Albion,
although weak, are malignant. Let our Leaders beware of
treachery, for assuredly some of those, in whom they place
their firmest trust, betray their councils for gold. Mark, too.
the cabals and intrigues at Paris, and at the Court of Spain .
Beware of the Northern Eagle, soaring high in its flight, and
burrowing deeply and craftily, like the Mole ; thatwhich its
fangs are fixed upon, is first approached. It is frank , cour
teous, fair, and friendly, until the time arrives when the prey
may be devoured, which has been lured by soft blandish
ments of false and Aattering tongues,and by smiling protesta
tions, till all escape from the snare is too remote for the con
fiding victims to hope for. Even the distant Territories of
Fez and Morocco appear to feel the shock of Nations. The
Cabinet of Vienna is not idle. Shortly will the ponderous
Orbs of Saturn and Jupiter join in the sign Capricorn ; mark
the changes thatwill follow ! Revolutions will succeed. Let
France beware, for the period approaches when its Bourbon
rulers shall sit no longer on the Throne. Prussia and Austria
will also feel the gradual effects arising from the great and
important changes working over nations.
Somestrange PoliticalMovements are afloat ; the journals
of the day are replete with rumours concerning them . A
Military Man is in greatdisgrace, or otherwise sorely afflicted .
Royalty gains a great accession of popularity. A celebrated
Female departs this life ; one of high bearing also follows in
the train of Death . This Month will be remarkable for sin
gular productions issuing from the press. A Lawser or See
nator of high degree is under the effect of malignant Pla.
netary rays. London appears particularly oppressed in her
Trade and Commerce ; failures and fires are frequent during
the Month. Churches and Legislative Buildings are in danger
of destruction.

“ Hark ! bear ye low deeply tłe sullen gun roars,
How the trumpet of war from each bill is resounding :
And see ! the invaders are spread on our sbores,
And over our plains the fierce war-horse is bounding.
Then onward to meet them , and nerved be each baud ,
And true be eacb heart that for freedom aspires ;
Be firm ,my brave comrades- be true to the land
That is sacred, for e'er,by the blood of our sires.”
Saturn andMars pass through Capricorn, Jupiter continues
in Sagittarius, Venus passes from Libra to Scorpio ;
Mercury also retrogrades into this latter Sign. There are
strangemanifestations in the politics of Europe. The various
Cabinets appear in a state of incertitude and bewilderment.
Spain is sorely afflicted, and many of her Provinces are in
insurrection, especially Catalonia and the neighbouring parts.
Germany, together with Barbary, Fez, the Egyptian States,
and the French African possessions, all seem in tumult.
Arabia pours forth its hordes ; in short, War stalks abroad
both East and West. Our own Country suffers, the monied
interests are crippled, large loans are required,and the people
at large are oppressed with new -levied taxes and increased
duties. France is not idle — her Horoscope looks cloudy;
Revolutionary fury and remorseless carnage have yet their
frightful task assigned them to perform in that distracted
Country ; oppression has stalked on in its dim course, till its
journey is nearly ended, but a little time and it will lie pros
trate in the dust.
The Aspects of the Month are prosperous to Martialmen ;
manypromotions take place,one Warrior, in particular,meets
with marks of high favour. A Clergyman or Lawyer is vili
fied ; some disgraceful Law proceedings occur. Å Lady of
quality is aspersed, and an intrigue of considerable noto
riety attains publicity, and occupies the scandal-lovers of the
town. A Marriage in the beau monde is celebrated. A
Statesman meets with marks of farour. A Lawyer or Mer
curialistis vilified and disgraced. Anotherascends theladder
of notoriety and fame. This Month produces many strange
Literary productions ; the press is attacked. There will be
some singular stock -jobbing carried on, and many Bubble
Compai ies will start, admirably calculated to entrap the un
wary. We may expect news of an insurrectionary character
from the Canadas, and also from our West Indian possessions.
Some very disastrous shipwrecks occur,togetherwith various
accidents in our inland navigation .

6. The snow ! the snow ! - 'lis a pleasantthing
To watch it falling, falling
Down upon earth with noiseless wing,
Asat somespirit's calling ;
Each fake is a fairy's parachute
From teeming clouds let down,
And earth is still, and air is muto,
As frost-enchanted zone."
Russia appears to bear a prominent part in the Politics
of the Month . Shebestirs herself in the warlike movements
which at present occupy much of the attention of the
European powers. She appears as if allying herself to,or
confederating with, some of the German States. Itmust be
obvious that neither good, nor even whatis called " fair play,”
can be intended towards England by these artful negotiations.
Again , let our Ministers be careful of our Colonies ; they are
and will be in danger, unless timely attention is paid to their
condition. More than one of the great Continental Powers
are eager to cripple England in this portion of her important
possessions. The times are most perilous, and weshall have
great need of all our strength and sagacity, for our foes and
evil-wishers are numerous. Themost to be dreaded are those
who approach us in the garb of friendship, and we regret to
say there are Englishmen who, for gain, would barter the
glorious land of their forefathers. France is busy, and ap
pears holding secret commuric :tion with Russia. The
American Statesdo not enjoy repose; discussions run high in
their chambers.
As the year terminates, the important questions between
Turkey and Egyptdo notappear to be settled . Spain is still
torn with Revolution,and Priestcraftholds there itsaccustomed
and injurious sway. The year throughout appears one of
contention, and both external and internaltrouble for England .
As we approach the close of this eventful period, our hearts
are saddened by domestic occurrences. A bright Star of the
World of Fashion bowsbefore the fell destroyer, regretted by
themultitude, her distinguished virtues having caused them
to revere her. One under the domination of Mercury is in
great disgrace, or is otherwise afflicted. Law -suits for Libel
are frequent, and the Courts are occupied in a cause where a
Lady of some celebrity loses her character. Some singular
matters regarding a Magisterial person are broughtbefore the
public. A Personage of bigh distinction departs this life,
whose brow had been adorned with a coronet,

" The Heart of Nature is a glad onenow ;
High in the Heavens are songs above the day ;
And love and gladness live on every bough,
In this clearmorning ofdelightfulMay.
The swallow do I see, the cuckoo hear
Blithe twitter, and loud voice, ye pleasemewell ;
0 ! maketheheart ofMan , likeNature's, clear
Throughoutthe Summer,where you cometo dwell."
The Spring Quarter commences March 20th ; at6b. 28m . past noon,

What delicate freshness in the foliage of thy own song and Nature's gladness
green, proud, [excess,
What graceful drooping dwells in everyo , blackbird! singing in love's sweet
spray, Thus in thy secret thieket piping loud,
Now in the rosy sún-light seen, Thou canst notMORE than I do feel ex.
In this clearmorning of the joyfulMaj. press.
Altbe cominencemeniof this quarter the celestial sign Libra ascends
the eastern horizon, and Venus,significatrix of thepeople, is located in
the eighth wansion,applying to a sex'ile ofHerschel ; the Moon,sigpi.
ficatrix ofRoyalty, is located in the fifib house, applying to the trineof
Mars and.sextile of Saturn . I judge that during this quarier thenational
outlay.andexpenditurewillbemuch increased,and thatincreased taxation
or duties willbecomenecessary ; that the causeof this willbe somewar
like preparations,wbich , in the present aspectofaffairs, appear unavoid
able. It appears an evil time for Royalty, although an eventmay occur
which will throw amomentary gleam ofpleasureoverthe illustriousbouse
holu, but somedanger willattend isprogress, and great anxietywillhe
excited. This threatens to be a very sickly period of the year ; some
strange disorders arise similar to those produced by Malaria. France
evidently shows a hostile disposition to us, and there is little doubt but
thatwe shall come to some sharpmeasureswith them . The Dock-yards
and Navy appear to be under somemismanagement; public interest is
much excited thereat, and we are not placed in the strong position we
should stand in, considering whatwe maybe led to expect, which will
certainly cause us to take either an offensive or defensive character.

THE SUMMER QUARTER .
“ Cometo the sunsettree!
The day ispast and gone;
The woodman's axe is free,
And the reaper's work is done.
The twilight star to Heaven ,
And the Summer dew to flowers,
And rest to us be given
Bythe coolsoft eveninghours.
The Summer Quarter commences June 21st, at Sh. 34m . pastnoon.
The Sun enters Cancer.

Sweet is thehour of rest,
Pleasant the wind' s low sigh ,
And the gleaming of the west,
And the turf whereon welie.
When the burden and the heat
Of labour's task are o'er,
And kindly voices greet
The tired one athis door."
As the Sun enters Cancer, the sign Scorpio arises on the ascendant,
Mars is located in the twelfth,the house of woe,trouble, and treachery.
This is a sorry aspect for the people, wbo during this quarterwill
certainly bemost grieved and oppressed ; and they will likewise suffer
much from sickness or epidemic. Mars is in quariile to Mercury; they
willbe deceived by some doings in Parliament, and means are again
tak n to raise funds for Government uses. Our enemies are waxing
siring, andwe appear in a very weak position . There is some heavy
fault existing wbich will certainly come to ligbt,and the perpetrators
meet with punishment. Somegrants are made by Government appa
rently for the Royalbousehold. The quarter is evidently evil for the
prosperity of thenation and its successgenerally ; depression of com .
merce will be greatly felt,and consequentscarceness of money. Con
siderably more attention is paid to thenavy and dockyards, butwith all
we are notstrong enough to withstand theatıacks of private enemies.

THE AUTUMN QUARTER.
" Moon of harvest, herald mild
Of plenty, rustic labour's child,
Hail! oh hail! I greet thy beam ,
As soft it trembles o'er the stream ,
And gilds the straw -thatch'd hamlet wide,
Where Innocence and Peace reside:
' Tis thou that gladst with joy the rustic throng,
Promptest the tripping dance,theexhilarating song.
The Autumn Quarter commencos September 23d, at 34m . past 5 o'clock
in tbe morning.

Moon of harvest, I do love
O 'er theuplands now to rove,
While thymodest ray serene
Gilds thewide surrounding scene ;
And to watch thee riding high
In the blue vault of the sky,
Where no thin vapourintercepts thy ray,
But in uncloudedmajesty thou walkest on thyway."
The aspects of this quarter present rather an untoward character.
Thepeople still seem to be much oppressed, and too much against the
proceedingsof Government. Royaliy also falls in public estimation,
anddecreases in popularity. Our enemies are still at work, and some
strange and intricate policy is practised against us. The square of
Herschel and Saturn looks ominous, apd warps of danger to the State.
It will, however, be discovered in time to be suppressed. Wemay
expect the destruction of some government or public building by fire ;
also, thatsome new works will be commenced, which will add to the
beauty ofour city. Thisquarter will be fearfully replete with accidents
by land, railroads, and also with steam -vessels. Many shipwrecks
occur. This time is evil for our commercialinterests. Foreign loans
arerequired,andwar still continues in many parts. Tbere will besome
talk of anaval engagement,wbicb bears relation to England. To the
high and powerful this quarter is prophetic of evil; many who bare en
joyed titled wealth,both lay and spiritual,depart this life.

THE WINTER QUARTER ,
Thesnow ! the snow ! I see him yet,
That piled-up giant grim ,
To startle horse and traveller set,
With Titan girth of limb.
We hoped , oh, ice-ribbed Winter bright !
Thy sceptre could have screened him :
But Traitor Thaw stole forth by night
And cruelly guillotined him .
TheWinter Quarter commences December 21st, 10h. 56m . past noon.

Her starr'd map to the moon , Dance o 'er ourmountains white,
And o'er hush 'd earth a radiance steals Chain up the billows as they roll.
More bland than that ofnoon : And pearlthe caves with light.
Mercury,significator of the people located in the fourth inmalignant
square to Herschel, is an evil and portentousprognostic for the country
and its interests ; bere it indicates a prevalence of sickness,misfortune,
and ibe pressure of tbe times. Government is also barassed from many
impending causes, among which war and foreign expenditure appears
prominent. The wbole looks evil, andas ifwewere placed in a dilemma,
from which it will not be easy to extricate ourselves. - It portends some
misfortune to the Sovereign and members of the Royal family : there
areappearances of some domestic calamity attending these illustrious
persons. Embassies arrive from foreign parts on matters of vital im
port,and politics both at home and abroad assume a suspicious charac
ter. Venus is applying to a square of Herscbel; this, again , is evil,
as itwill mostmaterially affect our pecuniary resources, and it is not
unlikely that loans willbe raised to meet the public exigencies. Com .
panies and variousspeculations will be started, many connected with
mines. Jupiter applies to the conjunction of Saturn in the Tropical sign
ofCapricorn, which indicates vast changes in empires and people, of
whichwe shall fully treat in our Messenger for 1842.

At the time of this Eclipse the last degrees of Scorpio ascended on
the eastern horizon, giving the Moon and Mars asprincipal significators
of tbe people. Virgo is on the cusp of the tenth house, Mercury,
therefore, with the Sun as co-significator, will indicate the probable
effect this configuration of the heavens will bave on Royalty, GOVERN
ment, and all matters pertaining to KINGLY Power. In examining
these significators,wefind Mercury combust in tbe third house, heing
the sixth from tentb, vitiated by a semiquartile of Saturn, and in oppo.
sition to theMoon. This is by nomeans a promising position ; it de
notesmuch trouble, vexation, sickness,and family misfortune to those
whose rank is of the bighest grade ; disease or death appears now to
extend its influence over them ; the extreme younger branches are
sorely threatened ; considerable loss of popularity is also denoted ;
and altogether a series of events annoying and vexatious. Mars, lord
of theascendant, dignified, Jupiter rising dignified,a fair testimonial
for the people at large ; but Saturn in the second still afflicts materially
themonied interests, and typical, from being in a double bodied, of
many failures of an extensive character, in commercial bouses, con
nected with or depending on foreign fuuds, or returns to be sent by
carriage. The sesquiquadrate aspects of the Moon and Mars indicate
ill-feeling on the part of our Continental neighbours; and, asMars
disposes of Venus, they would urge War ; we shall, however, be
successfulagainstthem . Theaspects in this figure particularly pointat
France.

Nor feel a taint through his pure essence spread
So perfectly has virtue hallowed thee.

Stole o ' er its sleeping sense - as if that smile

RAPHAEL'S PROPHETIC MESSENGER FOR 1841.
HOROSCOPE OF THE PRINCESS ROYAL.
The timeofthis Royal Infant's birth is taken from the Gasette of
Saturday, Nov. 21st, 1840:
“ LONDON GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY.
“ SATURDAY, NOV. 21st, 1840.
“ Buckingham Palace,Nov.21st,1840.
" This afternoon, at ten minutes before two, the Queen was happily
delivered of a Princess, His Royal Highness Prince Albert,Her Royal
Highness the Duchess of Kent, several Lordsof HerMajesty's Privy
Council, and the Ladies ofHer Majesty's Bedchamber, being present."
The Princess was presented to the Lords in waiting exactly at the
time above-mentioned. In ourHoroscopewehave allowed five minutes
previous to this time, supposing it to be the shortest period that could
elapse before the presentation took place.
The birth may therefore be supposed to have occurred atlh.45m .,
p . m ., Nov. 21st, 1840, at which period the celestial wanderers were
placed asin the preceding diagram .
The twenty-second degree of the sign Pisces arose upon the Ascend.
ant. Giving Jupiter as the natal star,we find him posited in thehouse
of death combust of the Sun, an aspect of DIREFUL IMPORT. And if
we further examine the situation of the Moon, who in this Horoscope
assumes the place of Hyleg, a giver of life, we find that orb applying to
the sesquiquadrate ray of Herschel, wanting only 12' of the partile
aspect, which will take effect shortly after birth ; and it is difficult to
say, in one so young, if the strength of the stamina will be sufficient to
resist themalignant influence: we fear Not — and would judge that
EARLY DEATH WAS PREDICTED. The three superior angles of the
figure are MOST MALIGNATEL. Herschel rising in the east, Mars de
scending in the west, and Saturn tracking his gloomy course through
Sagittarius in the south angle, in square ray to both the former malifics,
who are likewise mutually opposed to each other. DissOLUTION OR
VIOLENT ILLNESS IS THREATENED IN EXTREME INFANCY, OVER WHICH
WE THINK IT NEXT TO IMPOSSIBILITY THAT THE ROYAL NATIVE
SHOULD PASS. And if it should be the will of the Great Dispenser of
all things to render the life such a
“ Brief story !- the tears of regret fast descending
Would blot from the landscape a vista so drear ;
If this, CHILD OF HOPE, be thy bright vision 's end
Oh ! wherefore live on the ill-omen 'd career ?
Butno - if one truth to the heart can be spoken ,
By feeling, by reason , by Oracle high ,
' Tis this, that when Life's golden bowl shall bebroken,
Thy star, Immortality,breakson thesky!"

“ Fair art thou as Morning, myyoung bride!
Her freshness isabout thee ; like a river
To the sea gliding,with sweetmurmur ever
Thou sportest; and wherever tbou dost glide,
Humanity a livelier aspectwears.
Fair art thou asthe Morning of that land
- Where Tuscan breezes in his youth have fanned
Thy grandsire oft. Thou hast not many tears,
Save such as pity from the heartwillwring,
And then there is a smile in thy distress !
Meeker thou art than lily ofthespring,
Yetis thy nature full ofnobleness."
This solar figure bears indication of the general tenor of life and
events connected with the RoyalNative untilMay 1842. Virgo rising,
givesMercury as chief significator; we find him located in tbe tenih
house unafflicted. After May, 1841, (should the Royal Native bave
escaped evils previously threatened, and indicated in this figure by the
Moon separating from the opposition of Saturn, lord of the Sixth and
FIFTH houses, the signification of v bich willbe readily known by stu .
dents,butwbich we cannot enlarge upon), should this timebe passed,
the Royal Native willhave greatincreaseofPOPULARITY,andgradually
Strengthening Power and DOMINION . The Sun applying to the oppo.
sition of Jupiter denotes some altercations with neighbouring powers,
and armswill be had resort to ; but no fear of evil to her Government
or to England need be entertained. The horoscope speaks of some
domestic calamities and sickness attending the family.

Earthly things
Are but the transientpageants of an hour ;
And earthly pride is like the passing pageantof an hour
That springs to fall,and blossoms but to die.
'Tis as the tower erected on a cloud,
Baseless and silly as theschoolboy's dream ,
Ages and epochs thatdestroy our pride,
And then record its downfall.
This schemeof tbe Heavens, having relation to thehoroscope of this
eminent statesman, as compared with the natus, is extremely evil ; the
Sun conjunct with Herschel in the tenth bouse, and in the common
sign Pisces, iudicates that during the year his public character will be
much called in question, and that some verygrave subjects of complaint
will be brought against bim . Jupiter, lord of the tenth in square, to
the Sun and Herschel,corroborates thenature of the preceding influence.
Under the action of these aspects be will certainly resign office. Radi
cally Herschel is transiting his tenth, and opposing Jupiter, lord of
tentb, in fourth : this goes to strengthen our previous opinions. On
thewholewe do not hesitate to say,that the year 1841 willbedetri
mental to the fame of Lord ViscountMelbourne. For boroscope, see

In that word
There is a charm which thrills through allher sons,
Where'er they wander ! Mid thebattle's rage,
For England,aye for England, is.the thought
Tbat runs from gun to gun,from rank to rank,
And fires the soul, and nerves each arm to strike,
With forceresistless. “ WhatwillEngland think.?"
Has been thespirit-stirring question oft,
In many a bloody conflict, wlien thescale
Of victory hung in dread suspense; and long,
My country,may thy all-unrivalled sons,
Asnow ,,enkindle at thy honoured name,
And England be the talismanic word
Tbat shall,fromage to age, its influence shed,
The safeguard, bulwark, glory of the land.
In the figure for 1841, deduced from the time of birth ofthis eminent
stalesman and soldier, wehave to notice many aspects and positions of
a sinister character. The Moon, lady of the ascendant, located in
the fourth house, and applying to the square aspect of Saturn, lord of
the eighth , be being located in the sixtb, certainly foretells sickness
and danger to this eminent native, and warnsbin that he may expect
some bodily affliction of a dangerous character. If we refer to the
boroscope, we find Saturu passing through the radical ascendant in
Capricorn : the Moon also , in the scheme, is applying to the square of
Mars and Saturo. These aspects evidently are dangerous, and will be
ofdeepand lasting effect. Forhoroscope,see Prophetic Messenger, 1840

Werefrain from putting down the aspects formed, and leave it for
the student's inspection. Comparing the longitudes together, wehave
reason to think that in 1841 Daniel O 'Connell will be infinitely more
successful in his agitation than hehas hitherto been. Hewill have, if
possible, greater popularity,and some of his proposals will meet with
grave attention from Government, and may also benefit the cause he is

Although this investigation for the year does not denote very great
success, still it will givemuch more popularity and active employment;
most likely as ministerially concerned, or as officer of state. The line
of politics he adopts will give satisfaction, as meeting the exigencies of
the times. It appears also, that some highly advantageous bills will be
brought into Parliament through his agency. This year threatens him
with some i disposition.

Tales of the vuild andwonderful.
THE YOUTHFUL ASTROLOGER.
BY AMICUS.
• Wecome!we come! and ye feel our might,
Aswo are hastening on in our boundless fliglat.
Ye call us the Winds; but can ye tell
Whither wego, or where we dwell ?**
In the autumn of 1808 I resolved to leave London, in the com
pany of a friend, to visit some parts of the north of England .
Our first intentionwas to have travelled in short stages, by coach ,
but at the officewherewewere about to book our places, wemed
a friend whose vessel was to sail the following morning for Leith ,
and the offer of berths in her wastoo tempting to be refused.
Our luggagewas accordingly sent to the Tower-stairs and shipped,
and the same evening we embarked ourselves.
· As soon as we landed at Leith,wemade ourway for Edinburgh ,
wherewe remained about a week, and then determined, contrary
to our first intention, to visit the falls of the Clyde, and the loch's
Lomond and Katrine, and then to return southward by way of
Stirling. To describe all that we saw during this journey is not
my intention ; it is to one incidentthat I am anxious to direct the
attention of my readers.
To have left this locality without ascending Ben Lomondwould
have been a proof of less curiosity and energy than we,as young
men, possessed, and the recollections of the journey would have
lost more than half their interest. Having determined to visit
this bleak summit, we took up our abode for a night at the little
inn at Tarbot, having inade terms with the guide for our journey
in the morning sufficiently early to witness ihe rising of the sun.
At an early hour we took our supper, and were joined by a young
man-of gentlemanly appearance, who was evidently no stranger
to the locality, although, like ourselves, a traveller. So much
₂ ₂\/\/\₂?₂₂/₂/₂mēģū₂ņģētiņ►Ứ?₂? Â?Â₂ Ò₂Â?Â₂Ò₂Â§ \/₂ūtiffi₂ ₂/₂/►ūtiò
we entrealed him to accompany us on our intended excursion to
the summit of Ben Lomond, to which he evidently consented ,
more from our anxiety for his company than from any peculiar
interesthe felt in a scene he had ofien witnessed.
Atfour o'clock in themorning we rose, and being joined by our
fellow -traveller, crossed the lake, and began the ascent, which
was in some parts tedious and difficult. Aswe stood on the top
of the mountain, a bright blue sky was above,and a rolling sea of
cloud beneath our feet, which was pouring its waters in a deluge
upon the surroundiug plains. Weremained for about tenminutes,
watching thelurbulent billows of theaerial sea, and then suddenly
the cloud rent in twain beneath our feet, opening a fairy view of
the lake and its bright share. It was like a glimpse at another
world , and seemed to be lighted up by a ray of more than solar
42 RAPIJAEL'S PROPHETIC MESSENGER, FOR 1841.
THE YOUTHFUL ASTROLOGER.
brightness. Thebroken cloud then united,and opened in another
part, giving a new and notless interesting view ; and this continued
un'il the cloud was broken into many fragments, which rising
rapidly, passed away. Wethen enjoyed the extensive view of the
surrounding country, and descendeil the mountain by nearly the
same path thatwehad taken in theascent.
Themorning's excursion was, as may besupposed, the subject
of conversation when we arrived at the inn,and would have con
tinued so during theday had not a stillmore interesting one been
broughtbefore my attention. Myfiend being fatigued with the
journey, hired a hack,which carried, or jolted him , over the
desolate plain which separates the lochs of Lomond and Katrine ;
while the stranger and myself, less distressed by the journey,
quietly followed him on foot. I commenced the conversation by
reverting to what we had seen on the mountain.
“ The sightwe have witnessed this morning," I said, “ is one
of those from which wemay derive pleasure of the highest order.
I think I have never before enjoyed such intense gratification ."
“ Yes," my companion replied, “ it is from nature thatmen of
cultivated intellect may derive pleasure of the purest kind, but
here are many ways of viewing nature. There are some who
view itwith pleasure because it is novel in some of its features,
and each succeeding scene obliteratesthe impression made by the
preceding. There are others who consider every scene in re
ference to its origin. But there are some who do not satisfy them .
selves with this, but consider every natural phenomenon in regard
to its primeaswell as secondary cause, and recognise in Nature,
Nature's Gud."
" It is thus weought to view all things, Iam aware," I replied.
“ You will, perhaps, be surprised," said my companion, " to
hear mesay that I do not consider the man of whom wehave
been speaking perfectly to enjoy nature. But my creed will
probably be too novel to be at once admitted ; but, as a mutual
feeling of attachment has sprung up between usduring our short
acquaintance, which will soon end, I will be candid , as itmay, I
believe, form a desirable subjectof reflection at a season of quiet.
Every natural object has, in mymind, a spiritualcorrespondence.
The sun is to me the emblem of Godhead . So in all inferior
objects there is also some spiritual correspondent; so that, while
I am viewing natural scenes, my mind is in close contact with
spiritual. This is, I believe, the only proper way of enjoying
nature.”
" This is, indeed," Ireplied, “ a novelway of viewing nature;
and, although a fanciful one, cannot be injurious, and, should it
everbecome general,willnot producethose disastrouseffects upon
society which a belief in universal sympathies have occasioned
by the growth of Astrology, Magic, and the kindred delusions."
“ Weare now coming upon a field of discussion, for which you
will probably scarcely find yourself prepared. Will you allow me
to ask,” he said , with much earnestness, “ have you ever ex
amined the pretensions of astrology ?”
RAPHAEL'S PROPHETIC MESSENGER, POR 1841. 43
THE YOUTHFUL ASTROLOGER.
" Ihave not. Am I to understand," Iinquired, “ that you are
an Astrologer ?”
; “ Assuredly," he replied.
" Perhaps you are a magician also ; and to that Imay attribute
the influence you have so quickly obtained overmymind ? ”
“ No !" said my companion ; “ I believe that an iniquitous
communication has been obtained by some men with spiritual
beings. Butthe stars were intended as signs, as well as for the
observance of seasons, and I can perceive no difference, as to any
moral wrong, between the knowledge that the rising of a par
ticular star at a certain time foretells spring, or that the position
of the planets denote a specific event."
Such was the nature of the conversation weheld during our
walk . At a small cottage at the end of Loch Katrine we found
my friend, still much exhausted, and exceedingly unwell. Over
the lakewewere rowed by two stout Highlanders, and after visit
ing the Isle of the Lady of the Lake, were put on shore near the
pass of the Trosachs. Of the wild scenery wepassed through I
will not speak , or I should too long delay the termination of this
chapter in my eventful life. My friend instantly retired to his
room on our arrival at the inn, and the stranger and I spent the
evening together. The subject of our conversation was again
discussed, and, to satisfy my curiosity, he was induced to cal
culate the place of the planets at the time of my birth. Many
things which had passed in my life he accurately stated, both as
to events and dates; but, in spite of these proofs ofhis science, I
still disputed and doubtedyet anxious to know the future, I
sought further proofs of his art. To this request hemade no ob
jection, but stated many circumstances which were to occur, and,
among others, that I should marry a lady in lowly circumstances,
but of noble birth, and one who would ultimately enjoy great
wealth . The following morning we parted, neither of us antici
pating a second meeting .
Two years after this event I accidentally visited a small but
pretty cottage in North Wales, and was hospitably entertained

becamemywife, and the latter died under my roof about twelve
months after that event. The loss was great to my beloved
partner, especially as she had but one other relative, and he was
in the army in India.
Months and years rolled round, and we continued to live a
quiet, retired, and happy life, each finding the best enjoyment in
administering to the pleasure of the other. About seven years
after our marriage, however, an event occurred which recalled all
that I have written to mymemory. A letter was received, stating
thatmy wife's brother had returned in ill-health , and was on his
way to our cottage. With what earnest anxiety did weawait his
arrival; but judge of our surprise when in him I recognised the
stranger that I metin Scotland , and he in methe husband of his
sister !
Byexposure to a foreign clime and hard service,his health had

remain on earth. By careful and diligent attention to his wants,
however,he survived nearly two years, and during that periodhe
communicated to me those lessons of wisdom which I so unwil.
lingly received. The prediction was literally fulfilled ; for my
wife was the daughter of the Earl of whose extravagant
habitsreduced his family to a condition approaching poverty, and
she becamerich by the possession of her brother's hard-earned
fortune,and ultimatelyby the possession of the family estates.
THE MAGICIAN OF GAUL,
(Wrillen expressly for thisWork.)
BY RICHARD RYAN, E3Q.
6 Why roams The MAGICIAN OF GAUL by the shore,
When the tempest atmidnight terrific doth roar,
When to slumber or shelter each peasant doth flee
Ah ! why wanders he then by the dark rolling sea
Is it that he seeks, at thatmysticalhour
Of darkness and terror, to add to his power
Somespell, which to him can only be given
When the cloud by the lightning atmidnight is riv'n ?
Is it thathe communes with fiends in the air,
Who of SATAN and all his disciples take care
Does hewhisper with those of whom sages say,
Thatwherever they tread all withers away ?
Doth henotmeet THE WICKED ONE whom he adores,
And wander they notby those lightning -lit shores ?
And doth not the guilty MAGICIAN then tell
How he intends peopling each chamber in Hell.
“ Oh, no, THE MAGICIAN he wandereth out,
When the tempest thus wildly is rev'lling about,
Not to commune with spirits of Hell at his side,
But to bring from thebosom of ocean HIS BRIDB.
For by spells most unearthly, terrific, and rare,
He, atlength, has discovered the billow just where,
’Neath its eddies, in cave, all pearl-strewn and dim ,
Sleeps a VIRGIN whomustbe awaken 'd by him .
“ Who is she ? who is she ? who thus in the sea
Hath lain thus enshrin'd - ah ! say who can she be?
What crimecould be hers, to be thus by spellbound
To a bed where the sea-weed is wreathing around.
" Oh, no crimewas hers, buther parents were fond
Of this child , their only one, oh,farbeyond
Than Heaven allows, or than parents should be,
So, to punish their fondness, did HEAVEN decree,

THE MAGICIAN OF GAUL.
Thatas she on the edge of a cliff gather'd flowers,
To bind round her brow in her pleasure-lit hours,
The rock should be treacherouswhich her foot prest,
And ocean received the fair form as her guest.
There slumb'ring for ages, the DAMSEL has laid,
And navies hare thunder'd in war o'er her head,
And groansof the dying — shouts of victors and foes
Have echo'd each other, nor stirr'd her repose.
Butyon dark MAGICIAN, when Nature's dread strife
Is an EARTHQUAKE destroying, will call her to life
Who lent him the spell, or who gave him the power,
I dare not conjecture in this awful bour.”
The storm is now raging — the blue lightning plays
Too frightfuland dazzling for usstill to gaze ;
The thunder in peals now echoes afar,
The sea is all foam , and sunk is each star ;
Darkness is shadowing each spot wherewe stand.
Behold the MAGICIAN — and see in his hand
A TALISMAN gleams, with which hemocks the strife:
Gaze on him no longer- away while we've life.
The MagicIAN came forth, and presented his form
To the flash of the lightning and rush of the storm ;
And the blast howling loudly tore open his vest,
And he then clasp'd THE TALISMAN close to his breast,
And called on his Demon, by that spell ofpower
Hehad treasur'd to use in this soul-harrowing hour,
And demanded his aid to bring forth froin the deep
The form which for centuries lay in death 's sleep.
But the TEMPEST increased, and the EARTHQUAKE began
To ravage with fury the dwellings of man
And the billows, likemountains, roll'd black on the shore,
And the cattle to ocean by thousands they bore ;
And the lightning riv'd oaks, and struck towers, and then
Wereseen on their knees themost godless of men,
Who had mock'd at their Maker, in field and in hall,
And were ever 'mong scoffers the loudestof all.
Then THE POWER WHOSE HAND CAN DESTROY OR GIVE PEACE,
Commanded this EARTHQUAKE of horror to cease ;
And thewaters retired,and the windswere all hush'd,
Nor longer to strew the plain the fork 'd lightnings rush'd
The thunder in faintmurmurs slow rolled away,
And the western horizon did rainbows display
Themorrow dawn'd soft - the air fragrantand balm
Swept the waters of ocean ,which lay in a calm ,
Reflecting like mirrors each tint that was given
To her waves, as swepto'er them the wing'd cloudsofHEAVEN.
The MAGICIAN was found on inetempest-strew 'd strand,
With the EMBLEMS OF SIN AND OF GUILT in his hand
46 RAPOAEL'S PROPUETIC MESSENGER, FOR 1841.
THE MAGICIAN OF GAUL,
His TALISMAN witber'd - his corse rent in two,
A sightmost terrific for any to view .
He lay on that shore till the night-tide's high wave

The seaman, wbile coasting, remembers his lot,
And pointing, he cries, “ Behold the dread spot
Where the WICKED ONE did the lightning deride,
There he stood, therehe vaunted, there DREADFULLY DIED."
THE HAUNTED LAKE.
BY THOMAS MILLER, ESQ .
Author of “ Royston Gower," " Fair Rosamond," “ Giles the Roper," & c.,& c.
There is a wood which few dare tread,
So gloomyare the hoary trees:
The vaulted chambers of the dead
Scarce till the soulwith half the dread
You feel while standing under these.
Deep in its centre sleeps a lake,
Which the o'erhanging umbiage darkens ;
No roaring wind those boughs can shake,
Ruffle the water's face, or break
The silence there which ever hearkens.
No flowers around that water grow ,
The birds fly over it in fear,
The antique ruots above it bow ,
The newtand toad crawldeep below ,
Theblack snake also sleepeth there.
Few are the spots so deathly still,
So wrapt in deep eternal gloom :
No sound is heard of sylvan rill,
A voiceless silence seemsto fill
The air arounıl that liquid tomb.
The ivy creepeth to and fro,
Along the arching boughs which meet;
The fir and dark -leaved mistletoe
Hang o'er theholly and black -sloe,
In darkness which can ne'er retreat.
For there the sunbeamsnever shine,
That sullen lake beholds no sky,
No moonbeain drops its silvery line,
No star looks down with eye benign ;
Even the white owlhurries by.
RAPDALL'S PROPNETIC MESSENGER, FOR 1841. 47
THE HAUNTED LAKE.
The huntsman passes at full speed ,
The hounds howl loud and seem to fear it ;
The fox makes for the open mead,
Full in the teeth of man and steed
Hewill not deign to shelternear it.
No woodman's axe is heard to sound
Within that forest, night or day ;
No human footstep dents the ground,
No voice disturbs the deep profound ;
No living soul dare through it stray.
For shrieksareheard there in the night,
And wailings of a little child ;
And ghastly streams of lurid light,
Have flashed upon the traveller's sight,
When riding by that forest wild.
For there hath human blood been shed
Beside the tangling bramble's brake,
And still they say the murdered dead
Rise nightly from their watery bed,
And wander round theHaunted Lake.
'Tis said she is a Lady fair,
In silken robes superbly dress'd ,
With large brighteyes that wildly glare,
While clotted locks of long black hair
Drop o'ertheinfant atherbreast.
She speaks not, but her white hand raises,
And to the lake with pointed finger
Beckons the step of him who gazes ;
Then shrieking seeksthe leafymazes,
Leaving a pale blue light to linger.
But who she is no one can tell,
Nor who her murderer mightbe
But one beside that wood did dwell,
On whom suspicion darkly fell:
A rich unhappy Lord was he.
In an old hall he lived alone,
No servant with him dared to stay ;
For shriek, and yell, and piercing groan,
And infant's cry, and woman 'smoan,
Rang through those chambers nightand day.
He was indeed a wretched man,
And wrung his hands, and beat his breast :
His cheekswere sunken, thin, and wan ,
Remorse had long deep furrows run
Across his brow - he could not rest.
He sometimes wandered round the wood,
Or stood to listen by its side;
Orbending o'er the meadow - flood,
Would try to wash away the blood ,
With which his guilty hands seemed dyed .

Henever spoke to living soul;
Oh, how an infantmade him quake !
For then his eyes would wildly roll,
And he would shriek,and curse, and growl,
While thinking of the “ Haunted Lake.”
THE MYSTIC MIRROR .
BY A GERMAN STUDENT.
“ Expanding spirits filled its countless forms,
And truth beam 'd calmly through chaotic storms,
Till shapes,hues, symbols, felt the wizard's rod,
And, while they sank in silence, there was God."
THE SOLITARY.
It was late, and I was alone in my chamber. The room where
I usually spent the evening was a large, gloomy, gothic-looking
place,with a huge old Mirror, one of the spoils of a Revolution,
at one end of it, in a ponderously carved frame; and as it had no
doubt witnessed the murder ofits possessor, and horrors which it
ought never to have seen , I used to sit before it of evenings list
ening to the wind howling in gusts, and gazing intently on its
dingy surface, till I thought the reflections of all thathad passed
before it were again apparent and presented to my view , and
murders and crimes of all descriptions jostled each other alter
nately off its cloudy space.
On theevening I have alluded to, methought,as Iwasbefore the
Mirror, thatthe events ofmy past life glided in review athwart it.
Yes, I saw them all sweep before me; thehours ofmy past, and
their actions, the visionings of my conscience. That was the
most dreadfulhour ofmylife ; but it has never returned ! Ha!
ha ! it cannot! Deep in the central background of the Mirror,
I beheld a sunny spot, apparently at an interminable distance.
Oh ! it would have taken years to reach it- years of,youth and
strength. A dull film seemed instantly to pass before it, but I
felt a longing to travel thither, and I gazed on it intently and
wistfully.
After a time it grew more distinct and more near ; a distant
murmurbrokeon the silence ofmy chamber, and gleamsof light
shot athwart the cloudy glass, and lo ! I beheld a thunder-storin
slowly rolling away over a princely park .
It was my own !
THE ORPHAN.
The sun shone forth with a gladsomegleam , and through the
Mansion's porch walked lightly a joyous girl, and kissed thetears
from the blue eyes of the violets that bloomed clustering along
the rich parterre. A pale, broken -hearted woman joined her,
and then confided the orphan to my care ; and I swore to protect
the lovely child , young as I then was. A brightness came over
RAPHAEL'S PROPAETIC MESSENGER, FOR 1841. 49
THE MYSTIC MIRROR.
the scene (those days of sunny innocence) - a brightness so in
tense, that my weakened, vitiated gaze could bear its light no
longer ; but through it I beheld the deathbed of that broken
hearted mother, and I heard her bless meas her departing spirit
confided in myprotection. Then the light vanished.
THE DESTROYER.
Stormsby sea and perils by land - wild scenes I have witnessed
in my travels, that spoke not to the heart,and scarce clung, or but
confusedly, to the barque ofmemory, now sweptacrosstheaccus
ing Glass.
The stormsat length rolled by, and once again the smile of
summer rested on my own old hall. I saw again that joyous
girl. I kissed her, but alas ! not as I had done ! She, too, clung
fondly to me. That hour sealed her fate ! She was still glad
some and gay, but not as before ! at times the pensive shade of
sorrow stole over her brow ,but that shade was the shadow ofher
destroyer that fell upon her heart. The destroyer was I, and I
cursed myself in that hour.
Time few fast, the shadow deepened on her brow , the tear ga.
thered in her eye, the rose faded on her cheek. Shewandered
unheeded and uncared for in that lordly park. No one sought
her in the gloomy hall. The poor outcast complained not, for
she had no friend to confide in, no relative on earth, and 1- I,
whom she had loved so fondly - I had betrayed and ruined her,
and was then far away !
THE OUTCAST'S DEATH .
A lovely evening oflate autumn gleamed in theMirror; I be
held her step forth from her lonely chamber. She passed across
the hall, my menials taunted her; she heeded them not, but
walked out into the park. The cold frost was on the earth, and
the leaves brokeharshly beneath herfairy tread ; the sun set, and
it grew cold ; the sea lay calm and white beneath the moon, like
a shroud'wound around a dead world .
She wandered to the shore, for my domain stretched along the
coast- she reclined on the beach and sighed, and the waves an .
swered her; she wept and the sea-dew fell around her ; she
stretched forth her arms- alas! poor girl ! she embraced eter
nity ! for the ocean wound his cool waves around her, and im .
printed a death-kiss on her fevered lip .
THE DUEL.
A gain I returned from my wanderings. I heard the story of
her death , and my conscience smote me heavily ; but after a
time it was forgotten, and many a gay scene rushed across the
Mirror. At length it brightened into a glittering saloon ; the
high -born and the proud were assembled ; in the midst of the
gaiety entered a lovely pair: the one, a beautiful bride- her hus
band, a high -spirited young noble, whom I had once known.
Heimagined I paid his bride too great attention, and hewas rude
to me. I could notbearhis having that lovely girl. I insulted

him . Hewas loath to fightme; he was too happy - to die ; but
I forced him to the contest, and he fell !
THE DYING AND THE DEAD.
The scene changed . The lustres vanished, but themorning
light rested on a wood. In thatwood wasan old oak tree - a tree
ofcenturies. Beneath its boughs lay a dying man ; he gazed
upward at the sighing branches with a failing eye- they almost
hid the blue heaven from his sight; even thus, in his mind lovely
visionings of earth passed athwart his hopes of eternity !
The youth gazed upon me with a melancholy and forgiving
look. I remembered it long. He, too, had justbeen united to a
lovely woman . Theywere parted now ,but the friend of his early
days stood by him still. He closed his eyes,and on the old oak.
treewas carved the words — " Here fell my only brother !" The
bride died mad - ay,mad ! Poorthing ! It drives me distracted
when I think of that !
That accursed Mirror showed menumberless other scenes; but
the formsalways changed to thedying and the dead, till at length
they settled into a miserable apartment.
THE GAMBLER - THE BROKEN VOW -THE SUICIDE.
Within this chamber sat a haggard, pale young man. His
brow was furrowed, not by years, but care. His eyes sunken
with woe. Well I knew him ; hewas a Gambler. By his side
sat a beautifulwoman, butshe, too, was like the pale lily nipped
by untimely frost. She fixed her pensive eyes on metill I could
scarce believe it was a vision I beheld. The man glared upon
me with a frenzied look, tillmine own quailed beneath it. But I
could notturn away. Again I had wroughtthis misery
Casper had abjured gaming when hewas nearly rnined ; but
he met with me, broke his pledge, and lost his all! Despairwas
in his heart as he re-entered his wretched home, and that
homewas now visioned before me. The low , sweet voice of his
sorrowing wife stole on my ear. She strove to comfort him , but
hewould not be comforted ; she caressed him , but he repulsed
her. “ Good night,my love!” he exclaimed with fervour, “ we
shall meet again !” She started at the strange adieu, but he
gazed calmly ather, and she left him . Calmly he re-seated him
self, and remained in silent thought with a rapt expression of
countenance,as if quietly meditating over the action he was about
to commit. The eye of the phantom was fixed upon me with
a glassy stare, as deliberately it raised its arm . Louder, to my.
startled ear, than a thunder -burst rung the report of a pistol. It
was like the voice of a fiend shouting forth a curse !
The smoke rolled away and the Mirrorwas again a blank.
CONSCIENCE,
I now sat for hours combating with my conscience, my eyes
fixed intently on the Mirror, till its blank space seemed a tablet,
whereon the Almighty would tracemy doom in charactersof fire !
A strange feeling seized me. I felt that I was powerful, both

mentally and physically,above common mortals. But there was
now a fierce combat within me!
THE GOOD AND EVIL GENIUS,
I continued looking at the Mirror, half in apprehension ,half
in pride, when twosupernaturalobjects suddenly started from the
opposite sides into its central space. They were ghastly, and
horrible to behold. A cold chill came over me. I gazed in
trepidation, for strangely both of them resembled myself. The
onewas dreadful and fiend-like, the other wasbeautiful; but the
expression was of such heartrending melancholy in its wan
countenance, that I felt as though I could have wept. These
objects were close to my chair, or rather to its reflection ; and
with an involuntary start of horror I turned my head , to see if
they were really in my chamber
The apparitions approached, even as if they had walked from
the Mirror ! With more of agony than I thought the human
brain capable of sustaining, I remained motionless in the attitude
in which I had risen. There stood those fearful shadows gazing
atme! I felt it was myGood and my Evil Genius; and I saw
the despairing melancholy eye of the former quail before that of
the demon , that gloomed upon it with a fierce annihilating frown.
They were engaged in a death -struggle formastery. The beautiful
spirit seemed appealing to mefor aid . A strange contrariety of
emotions and wishes assailed and bewildered me. I hesitated
turned away my eyes; and lo ! when I looked again , one figure
alone remained ! It was surely my very self. Satan, in all his
glory, could not be more triumphant.
The calm , sweet shadow of myGood Genius had faded quite
away. The Evil Genius had obtained themastery, and a sensa
tion ofreckless triumph filled my breast. Iwas joyous and glad ;
the sickly fancies that had haunted my mind were gone ; the
weak promptings of dastard conscience were for ever banished.
Now I felt sustained, upholden ; I could move fearlessly as a
superioramongmy sinful and daring fellows.
THE FUTURE.
I recalled myscattered thoughts and turned to the Mirror
boldly ; I cared no more for its fleeting shadows, and, in the
pride of my heart, I uttered a wish to gaze into futurity. I.
looked inquiringly upon the glass, and beheld myself, pale,
haggard, degraded, and desponding. At length I flew to an
ancient cabinet, and drawing from its recesses a small and care
fully concealed phial, I hastily drank the contents, and, with a
thrill of horror, fell upon the floor, to all appearance death
struck .
I still looked intently on the Mirror's surface, its fastenings
gave way, and, with a sudden crash , the sheet of glass fell, shat
tered in fragments, to theground. Iwelcomed theomen asridding
me of these frightful spectral visitations, though I felt that in
every broken piece that strewed the ground , I beheld the eye of
the Demon fixed upon me!

Without any indication,one of theboilers,

veral revolting murders, also, were com

child, named William Murray, by its
father,who caused him to swallow vitriol,
will be remembered. The case of Mato

SEPTEMBER, 1840.
Woe to the m hty ones ! the grim Must we still add,to convince those who
conqueror comes; he strikes- they fall, are incredulous of the verity of Astral
andare forgotten., science, that our Hieroglyphic of 1840 de
picts in symbol what is also said in words.
Are not the mighty ones gone ? The
royalfuneral predicts the death of the il.
lustriousmember of the Royal Family,
PRINCESS AUGUSTA.
EXPLANATION OF THE SCENES IN THE
HIEROGLYPHIC OF 1840,
Although the hieroglyphics which have from the commencement of the Prophetic
Messenger been placed as a frontispiece to the annuals are known to have been
RAPHAEL'S PROPHETIC MESSENGER, FOR 1841. 61
singularly accurate predictionsfor the coming year,nonehave had a more marked
fulfilment than that in our last Almanac. So evident, indeed, are the allusions, now
the events have passed, that it ishardly necessary to state them , nor do we attempt
the explanation underanyother feeling than thatof removing the lingering doubts
toastrological science, which from the prejudices of education may still find a place
in theminds of someofour readers.
Thedesign on the lefthand side,at the top of the plate,represents a battle in an
eastern country, as shown by the cupolas on the buildings and the dresses of the
combatants. That Egypt is concerned is evident from the pyramids being intro
duced. This prediction has been accurately fulfilled, notonly in its spiritby the con
tinued animosity between Turkey and Egypt, butalso in theletter by theinsurrection
in Syria,and the formidable revolt ofthe Druses,which is notat thepresentmoment
completely subdued.
Beneath this figure is represented a shipwreck,which is intended to show that the
loss of life and property at sea would be greater than usual, and that some events of
this kind would attractmore than ordinary public attention . Two instances are still
fresh in the memory of all who are acquainted with passing events-- that of the
Castlereagh and Lord Bentinck. One or two other of the many naval incidents re
corded in the daily papers during the past year,maybementioned as instancesof the
remarkable casualtieswhich have fulfilled theprediction.
In March last, the Hopesteamerwas lost on the Zitsikamma coast,on her way
from Table Bay to Port Elizabeth. “ After we left Table Bay," says one who was in
thevessel, “ wehad a strong south- east gale till Wednesday morning, the 11th, when
aheavy fog set in , going between eight and nine knots an hour,when at half-past 3
o'clock p.m . the vessel struck on the rocks. By the reckoning of the captain we
were about 25 miles from land, which, however, afterwards proved to be wrong, for
when the fog cleared up, wewere within 1000 paces of the shore. By forming a raft,
many of the passengers and seamen gotto shore,while otherswere left for a night on
the wreck,butwere saved on thefollowing morning. The vessel shortly after went
topieces."
On Saturdaynight, the 25th of July, a fearful collision took place between the
steamboats Governor Dudley and theNorth Carolina, which resulted in the lossof the
latterboat, together with the passengers' baggage, and the United Statesmails for the
south. Providentialy no liveswere lost.
Thelowest design on this side of thehieroglyphicalsheet,represents Death standing
over a coffin , which bears the royal crown, the bishop's mitre, and the earl's coronet,
showing that death would bebusy in the highest ranks ofour fellow -men. The reader
willremember that this has been the case ; we will mention the names of a few of
theillustriouswho have, during thepast ninemonths, been carried to the sepulchres
of their fathers:-the King of Prussia,the Empress of China, the Bishops of St.
David'sand Chichester,and the Earlof Durham .
In the centre of the plate,beneath the horoscope for the year,is seen a poorman
returningthanks to Heaven for a bounteousharvest, as affording to him a ineans of
subsistence. The returns which have been made from various parts of this country
are highly satisfactory, not only as to the abundance of the crops, butalso as to the
state in which they have been brought into thebarns of the husbandman. For many
years past there has notbeen a season so universally fruitful. In the same figure,
however, is represented the effects of themore violentagents of nature, such as earth
quakesand hurricanes, which have also occurred. Accounts have recently reached
this country of the destruction of the celebratedMount Ararat, and the loss ofmany
lives in the surrounding villages.
The figureat thebottom ofthe plate represents a lawless assembly opposed by the
military. Theriots at Monmouth, headed by Frost and Williams, and thedisturbed
stateof South Wales,are toowellremembered by our readers to require anyremark :
ourprediction has been in thisinstancealso fulfilled.
Theupper figure, on the right hand side of the plate,represents the funeral of a
person of , and was introduced to show that many rich and powerfulwould
be called to exchange worlds: VERIFIED BY THE DEATH OF THE PRINCESS AU
GUSTA.
Beneath this is represented the House of Peers in deliberation, an act which they
can scarcely have been said to haveattempted for many years past. During the past
session, however, they have considered several important measures, particularly the
Irish Corporations' Bill,and have rather aided than retarded the progress of legis
lation.
Thenextsubjectis a group of ecclesiasticswithwhips,showing that thepriesthood
would again attempt coercion where persuasion failed. This has been already done
to some extent in Ireland aswell as in England; butthe year is not yet spent, and we
leave itto fulfil the remnantofour predictions,

HOW TO RECTIFY A NATIVITY.
There are several ways of rectifying a Nativity, according to the Pre
scription of the ancient Students in this Science, viz.; first, by the
TRUITINE ofHERMES ; secondly,bytheANIMODAR of PTOLEMY; thirdly,
by Accidents. The two first I utterly reject, as having no verity to
support tbem ; therefore I shall not spend timeto explain those things
Chat are ofno benefit,but adhere to those ofAocidents only.
88 RAPHAEL'S PROPHETIC MESSENGER, FOR 1841.
KEPLER'S DIRECTIONS FOR STUDENTS.
To do this, it must beby such Accidents that have already happened
to the NATIVE, and to that purpose you must collect as many of them as
you can possibly procurp, and those that have been eminent ones for
SICKNESS, loss ofREPUTATION, or preferred to HONOUR, MARRIED, & c..
with the Year and Month, and, if possible, the Day of the Month
when any of them happened.
Having done this, consider the quality of those Accidents, whether
they have been such as bave bappened to the body, or otherwise ; if to
the body, then it is to be expected from the directions ofthe Ascendant.
But ifit be for Prefermeut, Honour, or Dishonour, & c., then it is to
be inquired after from the Progression of theMidheaven, if lossor gain
from the second House or Pars Fortuna, & c.
Note, likewise , whetber any of the given Accidents that happened
might be effected from the directionsof either ofthe Luminaries, which,
if so, those will notbelp to rectification.
Also note, the Planet,or part ofthe Schemewhich is to be directed,
is called the significator,and thatwhich it is directed to, the Promittor.
These thingsbeing obtained,proceed now to draw a figure to the esti.
mate timeof Birth, and place the Planets therein ; draw also a Specu .
lum thereof, to consist of thirteen columns, according to the example,
and place the several Planets and Aspects tberein.
This being done,view theSpeculum to find whatdirection itmigbtbe
(at the age given) to denote such an Accident, which having found,
if itbethe Ascendant,take from a table of Oblique Ascensions, fitted
to the latitude of the Place of Birth, the Oblique Ascension of the Pro
mittor, observing itslatitude, ifthere be occasion,whicb, if it be to the
body of a Planet that you direct, then itmust be the sum of the Planet ;
but if to the opposition of a Planet, then the contrary latitude must be
taken .
If it be theMedium Cæli that is to be directed, then, from a table of
Right Ascensions, gain the Right Ascension of the Promittor, accord
ing to the latitude as before directed.
Then convert the timeofthe Accidentinto degrees andminutes,mak
ing an arch of direction,which being obtained, subtract this arch of
direction from the Right or Oblique Ascension of the Promittor; the
sum remainingwill be the true Rectified Right or Oblique Ascension
oftbeMedium Cæli, or Ascendant. If it be the Ascendant, subtract
90 degrees from it, so you have the RightAscension of the Medium
Cæli,and from this sum subtract the Right Ascension ofthe Sun (ifit
can be done, otherwise add 360 degrees) what remains being converted
into time, by a table for that purpose, showsthe time of Birth in hours
and minutes afternoon.
EXAMPLE.
A person born Tuesday, April the 7th, 1657, about two hours after
noon.— The Accidents given are these:
1. In the year 1673, being almost 16 years old ,was a timeof much
pleasure, viz.,delighting in dancing, music, & c.
. 2. Being aged 34 years and about five weeks, a violent cold ,which
initiated a tedious sickness which lasted 2 years, and other afflictions.
Now , looking on tbeSpeculum , I find theMidheaven comes to the body
of Venus about that time the felicity is mentioned to begin at, wbich is
a proper direction indeed to it. Also, I observe that the Ascendant by
direction comes to thebody of Saturn and opposition to Mercury,about

agree to denote one and the sametimeofbirth , as followetb :

First turn the time ofthe Accident into an arch of direction,which is
equal to 33° 36 ', which being obtained, proved as follows:

By the corroborating testimonies ofthese two operations, the oneper.
formed from the Ascendant,the other from the Midheaven, according to
those remarkable times of a person 's life, I conclude ibe Nativity to be
exactly rectified,and may now proceed to find out future contingencies.
After this method, you must by Accidents examine the verity of all
Nativities, and never depend upon a single testimony only for a suffi
cient rectification, but prove it by twoat least; indeed, the more it is
proved by, themore certain itmay be relied on.

AND FIRST, OF TAE ASCENDANT.
Having gained from a table of OBLIQUE Ascensions, fitted to the La
titude of the Place of Birtb , the Oblique Ascension of the Ascendant,
which is called the significator; then, from tbe same table, produce (by
making proportion, if need be) theOblique Ascension ofthePromittor;
tben subtract the Oblique Ascension of tbe Ascendant from the Oblique
Ascension of the Pronittor; the remainder is the Arch of Direction ,

By this method may a Nativity be directed, and is farmore easy tban
the melbod used by RegioMONTANUS or ARGOL, and, I presume, much
more correct, as being more conformable to Nature and Renson : and
alebough it may seem , by itsdifferentoperations, to be altogetber novel
(to some), yet it isthe samemetbod which the ingenious KEPLER (of
never-10-be-forgotten memory) invented, the measure of time only er.

the sake of the learner, it being readier iu operation , and more easily

92 RAPHAEL S PROPHETIC MESSENGER, FOR 1841. .
RAPHAEL' S TWENTY -FIRST YEARLY ADDRESS.
Courteous Reader - Supported by the enthusiastic cheers of public
opinion, we launch ourlittle bark on its Twenty-FIRST ANNUAL Vor
AGE. The great and increasing success of the past cheers our spirits for
the FUTURE. The PUBLIC JOURNALS echo the truth of our predictions,
and actual events establish the facts of our calculations. The Rock of
Truth, on which the sideral art is based, is impervious to every blast;
as for instance, theGrantto Prince Albert,the Marriage of ourQueen ,
the Fire of York Minster, and the Death of the Princess AUGUSTA, so
plainly indicated in ourpredictions for September, 1840, abundantly tes
tify. The Hieroglyphic for 1840 is most strikingly fulfilled in all its
scenes (and is copiously explained at page61). Itmust beborne in mind
also, that the work is written a very long period previous to the passing
of events foretold by us, and depend for their fulfilment on the truth of
Astral Science, our knowledge of the same, and our giving its true
meaning aright.
For 1841weare buoyed up with the hope ofabundantsuccess,which
will add strength to the character of our work . The AGRICULTURIST
will find in it a Weather Guide, and other matters of utility. The
POLITician may learn in our Astro Gallery the windings of the Cabinet.
The Student will find tables for his use (in no other work, since Dr.
Olinthus Gregory ceased to insert them in White's Ephemeris),
which are attended with infinite labourand expense, although ouraffection
for and sympathy in his studies rendersit a cheerful duty. The CHRIS.
TIAN willbe pleased with our Poetical Extracts, which tend to lead the
mind " through Nature up to Nature'sGod ," and the general reader
willbecome enraptured by the Talesand Miscellaneous Articles.
COURTEOUS Reader, FAREWELL ! !! May happiness and a cheerful
disposition attend thee and thine ; and, in the language of Cicero, I con
clude by saying,thatI trust my WRITINGS IN Raphael's PROPHETIC AL
MANAC " belongto allseasons,to allages,and to allplaces:afford improve
mentto youth,delightto old age- are an ornament to prosperity,provide
a refugeand a solace in adversity ; they amuse athome,are no hindrance
abroad ; they add pleasure to our nights, they amuse on a journey, they
are our companionsin the country.” Believe me thy Friend,
PHAE. RAPHAEL,
The Astrologer of the
Nineteenth Century.

FARMER’S AND GRAZIER'S KALENDAR, FOR 1841.
JANUARY.
Io fresh weatber theploughmay beset in motion. Turn over stubble.
lands intended for green crops or summer fallows. Frost will correct
wet ploughing; but this operation should be but seldom performed
unless the soil is moderately dry. During thefrost apply composts; ma.
nure may be taken to distant fields, and deposited in large beaps or
scattered on the surface. Thrasb grain, so as to afford ample supplies
of straw for littering courts. This and the following month constitute
thechiefseason for converting straw into manure. Dovote attention to
live stock, by affording sbelter and supplying food at regular bours.
Keep fatting cattle dry,and give them stored roots during frost. Cows
require succulent roots, or food prepared by steam or hotwater, to yield
milk copiously. Shelter new dropped lambs, and give their dam 's roots,
bay, and bruised grain, or linseed cake. Ewswill not produce fat lambs
atthis seasonwithoutnutritious food.
FEBRUARY.
Frost being a powerful agent in obtaining mould for covering seeds,
plough grass and other lands intended to produce a crop. Whether
turnip be folded or carried from the field, plough the land as thecrop
is removed , and wbeat sowing may follow . Beans and oatsmay besowo ;
butit is only rich dry soils which can be seeded so early with prospect
of success. In mild weather, thorn bedges diay be dressed, and new
ones planted. Lay ap stores ofseed corn, put implements into working
trim , and execute many little jobs, that no interruption may be expe
rienced in sowing time. Animals about to bring forth merit particular
attention, the supply ofmilk and strength of offspring being affected
by thedam 's treatment, previous to birth . Keep calves warm , clean, and
dry ; give bay and sliced roots in addition to liquid food to such as are
rearing.
MARCH .
Continue preparations for seed -time. Finish wheat-Bowing about the
middle of themonth. Sow beans, oats, and barley as soon as the wea.
therand soil admit, - reserying cold wet lands till the season advances.
The seeds of clover and ryegrasswill succeed amongst autumnal.sown
wheals, without harrowing or rolling the surface. Particular fields in
tended for barley or potatoes may receive a second ploughing. Prepare
compost and manuros for turnip . Tbis is the best time for planting
bedges. Inaltering the diet offatting animals,always let the change be
to one more nutritious. Part of the fatting cattle may be allowed
bruised grain or linseed cake, which will quickly fit them for the
shambles. If scarcity of turnip renders a richer substitute necessary
for advanced catile intended for grass, give a small allowance and plenty
ofstraw . Eweswilllamb freely on arable farms, and seldom require
any kind of food butgrass and turnip.
104 RAPHAEL'S PROPHETIC MESSENGER , FOR 1841.
APRIL.
This is themost importantseed-monih, andno favourable opportunity
sbould be lost to sow grain crops. Harrow and roll clover and rye
grass sown amongstwheat,to ensure the seed germinating. Store the
residue of the turnip crop, to preserve the bulbs and prevent the ex
baustion ofsoil. Drain lands intended forgreen crop w bere previously
neglected. Potatoes may be planted in favourable situations. Finish
planting tborn edges. On store farms, tbis is the chieflambing season,
and heshepherd's ulmosta:teation is necessary. Cease folding lurnip,
and either feed sbeepon stored roots,or restrict them to grass. Falting
lamb bogs require good pasture,being unable to eat turnip freely,from
shedding teeth. When tbere is a scarcity of keep at the homestead,
lean cattie may be allowed to roam over permanentpastures. Seedling
grasseswill seldom admitof being depastured witb cattle .
MAY.
Conclude the sowing ofgrain crops; and,with the advance of the
season,use early varieties. From necessity, barley and peasmay be
sown up to the end ofthe month ; bit early-sown spring crops are gene
rally themostvaluable. Be diligent in preparing soils for potatoes and
turnip ; and by judiciously using barrow and roller, endeavourto retain
moisture, and prodnce a fine tiith. Fiuish potatoe planting. Give a
second ploughing to summer fallow , and never allow vegetation tomake
progress at this seasou on its surface. Fatting cattle may be continued
on well-kept Swedish turnip and potatoes. Where ibere is a sufficiency
of grass, and the soil becomes dry,stock pastures with all descriptions
ofcattle. In cold and wetevenings, shelter milch cows and fat cattle
in courts. Wean early calves, and turn late ones out to pasture.
JUNE.
This is the month for sowing turoip. Put Swedes into the earth be
tween 2012 May and 10th of June. All otber varieties may be sowu in
the course ofthemonth. Drilled crops require attention. Weeds are
most easily destroyedwhen young ; and, as a general rule , use band and
horse hoes as soon as the crops admit ofthe operations. Earth up early
planted potatoes. Haymaking commouces in early situations. Mow
grasses before the plants seed ; remove the cropquickly from theground,
and soon afterwards carry it to the stack, Cattle may be beat soiled this
month ; but the practice is seldom followed,andhas little to recommend
it beyond makingmanure. Sb-ep-shearing becomes general, Fleeces
are proportionate to the treatment of animals; and every progression
or falling off in condition may be traced in the quantity and quality
ofwool. JULY .
Conclude baymaking from artificial grasses. Single outturnip, and
let band and borse hoes be in constant requisition, with a view ofim
proving the crops, and benefitting succeedling ones. Work fallows
thoroughly with plough, barrow , and roller, carefully removing root
weeds by the hand, - atmospheric influence being generally insufficient
to accomplish their destruction. Execute draining, and apply lineand
ime-composts when such operations are necessary. Hand-weed grain
crops. In warm weather fatting cattle and milch cows are the better
ofsheds, to sbelter them from the sun. Througboutsummer examine
focks daily, to preserve them trom the attack of fies, and use the
common remedies for theprevention and destruction ofmaggots.
AUGUST.
Conclude hand and borseboeing turnip. Applymanure to the fallows,
and immediately plough it into the soil, putting the ridges into proper
form , and clearing out water-courses, to guard agaibst wet weather.
Thrash out the residue of the grain , to extirpate rats and mice before
the new crop is stacked. In mountain districts baymaking from
RAPHAEL'S PROPHETIC MESSENGER, FOR 1841. 105
natural grasses engages the attention of store-farmers. In low situa.
tions corn-barvest will occupy all baods, Lambs not separated from
their damslast month, must be weaned and put on the best pastures.
On lowly situated arable farms get in ewes for early lambing. Ia bigb
districts, eelect and prepare the stock which is to be sent to market in
course of autumn.
SEPTEMBER .
Thismay be considered the harvest wonth. Engage plenty of assist
ing bands for this important season. Guard against sbaking winds by
reaping before the juices have left the straw ; and to avoid sprouting,
keep cut crops always standing in an upright position. When the crop
isfit for stacking, earry it by day and by night, and cover the stacks as
soon as they are built. Prudent farmers provide s!ores ofrope and
thatch before harvest commonces. Hand-weed turnipwhere necessary.
Finish fallows; and such as are wet and coldly situated may be sown
with wheat.' On arable farms, weaned lambs and ewes for early lambe
ing'may be allowed to depasture stubbles and seedling grass. The
breeders, rearers,and feeders ofstock willmeet at the differentmarkets,
andmako arrangements for their customary changes of animals.
остоBER.
Harvestbeing finished,employ the plough in preparing soils forwheat.
Commence with the wettest lands, and only defer sowing such as are
dry and situated in an early climate. Use the common preventatives for
smut inmediately before scattering the seed,and never sow unless there
besufficient moisture in the soil to effectgermination. A good deal of
thrashing is commonly requisite for supplies of cash, straw , and seed.
wheat. Gather the potatoe crop, and carefully secure it from frost.
Unless there is abundance ofgrass, fatting catile and sheep sbould be
supplied with turnip on the pastures. Towardsthemiddle of themonth
remove fatting cattle to the courts, and sheltermilch cowsduring night.
Keep weakly calves warm , and allow them a portion of nourishing food.
NOVEMBER.
Conclude potatoe harvest. Finish wheat sowing, although this grain
may be sownany time on rich dry soils up to the middle ofMarch. At
thisseason, as newly-ploughed land receiving rain seldom becomes dry,
80w wheat from day to day as the soil is turned over. Store turpip to
usein frosty weather; and wheat may be sown where the crop is re
moved. Form limecomposts for applying in spring and summer. This
is the best time for draining soils intended for green crop and fallow .
Dress hedges and ditches. Sheep intended to be fatted should be folded
on turnip, and allowed dry fodder. Lamb-bogs will thrive best with an
allowance of turnip on pastures. To all Aocks apply the salves and
lotions in common use. Cattle of all descriptions should receive fodder
and shelter during night, and such as are fatting shut out from the
pastures.
DECEMBER
Continue to plough stubbles. Store turnip in mild weather. A great
deal of straw will be requisite ; and regulate thrashing, so that there
may be enough to last throughout the season. As generalwinter em
ployment, in mild weather dress ditches and repairfences, drain and add
by every possiblemeans to tbe stores ofcompost and putrescentmanure.
During trosty weather bring forward materials for drainsand composts,
and remove all heavy commodities which require a firm surface for
transport. Cattle of every description should now be in winter quar.
ters, and receivewinter fare. Separate the weak from tbe strong. Have
a constant supply of water to store cattle, and apportion their litter
and food so that theymay last untilthe arrival of the grass seas?D. Give
tattiag cattle at all times as much as they can eat, commencing with
globe turnip,and proceeding with food of increasing richness.
