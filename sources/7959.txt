  		              		Experience Description   

    I was having my third c-section, 35 weeks into my pregnancy. My oldest daughter was my support person allowed in the room. Once my placenta was removed, doctors weren’t able to stop the bleeding. I remember looking over at the blood pressure monitor and seeing the reading of 40/30. I told the midwife that something doesn’t feel right. At that moment my heart stopped.   

  I was in a bright light. I wasn’t in a human form, rather, I felt like myself but as a energy. I spoke but not with words. I spoke with mental energy or something along those lines. Other people or energies were there. There were people I knew who were there.  I could feel love and a peaceful, contented feeling. I didn’t recognize each person, or more precisely their energy, with me but I knew I know them. They spoke to me like I did with my mind. I remember sensing them and hearing  sounds that were reminders of things I’d been through in my waking life. I was told so many things, although some are hard to remember now. I do remember scenes from being a young child and all the way to growing up.  It wasn’t like I was watching it. I was sensing  and feeling it. It was just so beautiful and peaceful. They told me that it’s not my time because I haven’t completed life. 

  At that moment, I heard a strange ringing like a old telephone. I opened my eyes, looked at my oldest daughter, and I started to cry. I cried of joy and what I had just been through. I told her that I was sorry that I’d been gone for hours. She told mom that it had only be around a minute that I had been gone.   I felt as though I was away for 6 or more hours. I retained so many positive feelings and knowledge in less then a minute. I don’t know what the right words to describe  the things that were spoken to me through the energy. The anesthesiologist asked me why I was crying and if I was in pain. I told him I felt comfort and that where I went, he’d never understand it.  I tried to explain it but I felt like they thought I was crazy. Every time I look back at that moment, I just feel a sense of peace,  comfort, and contentment.

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes.    I lost awareness of my body  
  
  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   Just a sense that I never felt. I wasn’t tired.  
  
  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         Right as my heart stopped until I heard the strange ringing sound.  
  
Were your thoughts speeded up?         Incredibly fast  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     I thought that I was gone for hours. Yet,  it had been less than one minute on earth. Everything that we spoke about with our minds or however we communicated it would be something that would take us many hours on earth. Up there, I felt like all this time passed and it really it didn’t  according to earth time.
  
Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I didn’t have eyes because I didn’t have a body form.  But, I saw a very bright white area, with  some blue colors.  
  
  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      Because I wasn’t in body form, I didn’t have ears. I wasn’t listening with my ears. I was listening and talking with my mind/energy or I really don’t know how I was speaking because it wasn’t with words.  So, I didn’t listen through my ears but I got all the messages  
  
Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         No       

Did you see any beings in your experience?         I sensed their presence  

  Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         Yes     Grandparents, old  family members who I never met in this life on earth, but I knew them.  
  
Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin  

  Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   I was in a white area that was white everywhere  
  
  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm.     On earth I’d call it a white room filled with white light. It was as though I was in a space because there was no ground or sky. It’s hard to describe because I didn’t fly. I was just an energy in a white area with blue energies and white energies  
  
What emotions did you feel during the experience?         Happiness, comfort, peace, content, love,  

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Incredible joy  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

  Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about the universe.     It’s hard for me to articulate an answer for this question. I just have a better sense of my surroundings and a better understanding of people and feelings  
  
  Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No.     I sensed smells and hearing of sounds that were familiar from a baby.  
  
Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

  Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will.  I was never asked if I wanted to come back. I was told it wasn’t my time but the way that I felt up there, it wouldn’t have mattered if I had to stay. But being returned back has been my biggest blessing because I’m so happy to be alive  
  
God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Protestant     

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         No       

What is your religion now?         Christian- Protestant     

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I always believe that there is a higher existence. Now, I know for sure there’s something Higher  
  
  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Uncertain     I just spread the word that there is an afterlife.  I don’t question another realm or a better place after we die. I no longer question and I just know for 100% certain that the afterlife exists  
  
Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         No     

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I sensed their presence  

  During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Yes     It was like a feeling that I had been there before and I had a sense that I’ve been to Earth many times too.  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     All  energies were equals. I call them  energies because it’s hard to say that they were human. Nobody was in a human form, but nobody was like an alien form. We just  were bodiless, but aware.  
  
During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Uncertain     I didn’t see God or Jesus. I sensed something was bigger  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      No     

  During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Uncertain     I’m not certain of that answer because I didn’t necessarily get a message of what the purpose is. But, I definitely feel like I have more of a purpose  after that experience  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         I am uncertain if an afterlife exists.          I didn’t speak of it with any of the energies but it was if I already knew the answer or the meanings that there is life after death.  It’s just not what humans would consider life after death - it’s different  
  
  Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes     I was told that my path with all my children is my right path. Any mistakes that I made, they actually weren’t mistakes.  
  
During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     Just a feeling of unconditional love in every second  

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life.     I don’t fear death anymore. I have a sense of peace. I fear only how the living will feel when somebody dies but I don’t fear for the people that die  
  
Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes.   I don’t think words can describe things that you’ve never felt or been through on earth. I try to compare these energies in speaking through minds but people think that you just see other people when you’re there.  Yet, it wasn’t people. It was almost like round globs, but they weren’t orbs. It’s very hard to describe what it was because we don’t encounter it here on earth  
  
  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience as accurately as other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  When I talk about it, I sometimes remember more things that I felt, sensed,  or talked about in that place.  
  
Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    That moment I woke up.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I was there. I know for certain what I felt  
  
What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real       

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No
