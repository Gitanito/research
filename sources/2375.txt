INTRODUCTION
METHOD OF PROCEDURE
In the preparation of this Manual for the CHURCH OF
ILLUMINATION, one thing above all others has been con-
stantly kept in mind: Throughout the entire service and
ministry, neither Priest nor Minister is called upon to make
a single statement, unless he can, without hypocrisy or men-
tal reservation, make the statement whole-heartedly and with
a clear conscience. Nor is he required to make any statement
that could not, with equal verity, be made by either the Neo-
phyte, Applicant or Member.
To effectively carry out this plan, changes in the usual
order of service were necessary. For instance: when we repeat
certain portions of the accepted LORD'S PRAYER. Is it possible
for any truly honest man to ask the Lord to give him his
daily bread? Should not every honest person be willing to
earn, not only his daily bread, but everything of which he
has need?
If this be admitted (and who can deny it?) should we
not rather ask the Father for THE STRENGTH AND THE
MEANS TO earn OUR DAILY BREAD? In this, as in all other
matters concerned with our religious service, we must try, to
the best of our ability, to harmonize with the Divine Law,
and our requests, our prayers and every detail of our services
should be in harmony. Every statement or request must be
so honest and so natural throughout all our services, that we
can look squarely into the eyes of any man, knowing that
in all things we did the Will of God and observed the Divine
Law to the best of our ability.

8 MANUAL OF THE
All statements and requests must be direct to God on a
man to man basis, without the slightest trace of apology,
disbelief, or qualification in our own mind.
The regular church service should open with the Sanctus,
or some other equally heart-warming and soothing music.
While the music is being played, the Priest or Minister walks
to the pulpit and takes his seat.
At the conclusion of the Sanctus, or other appropriate
music, the Priest or Minister will slowly walk to the Altar
and, with uplifted arms, slowly, clearly and impressively
give the Invocation. The Invocation may be repeated three
times. Concluding the Invocation, the Priest or Minister will
return to his seat; then rise for the responsive reading.
This reading may be in whole or part from the Suppli-
cation andlor Responsive Reading. Before proceeding with
the reading, the Priest or Minister always repeats the Intro-
duction or Explanation to the Responsive Reading. This is
immediately followed by the reading itself.
Contained in this Manual will be found the entire Temple
and Church Service. The service, either in whole, or in part,
may be performed during the Consecration of an Applicant
for the Priesthood or the Ministry; or, it may be performed
as a yearly service.1 When this service is attempted, every
one engaged in the service must be fully prepared for his
part and the music selected for the occasion must be in har-
mony with the work and of the highest order.
The music must be operatic in style, rich in variation, its
major and minor strains alternating from pianissimo to
fortissimo. The prelude should end triumphantly in march
time, and the words: "Glory, Glory, Glory," should be sung
in all the sublimity of power and great fervor.
1This service may be separated into three parts or renditions and given
either on separate days or on a forenoon, afternoon and evening.

As the strains of the last "Glory" die away, the chant
begins. Soft, devotional music is played throughout the ser-
vice and must be in perfect harmony with the development of
the theme of the Temple service.
This music should express, as nearly as possible, every
shade of emotion through which the Applicant passes and
that the Priest or Minister should feel. It should manifest
Light as Light comes to him, no less than suggest shadows
and clouds of darkness when contending difficulties are ex-
pressed. When anything pertaining to the carnal nature is
dwelled upon, the accompanying music follows a minor
strain. Conversely, at the close of the service, and in accom-
paniment to the beautiful confession of faith and assurance
by the Supplicant or Applicant, the music should swell to a
triumphant conclusion.
In no instance, let us repeat, is the complete Temple
service attempted unless everyone participating is fully
prepared.
At the close of the Responsive Reading, the Priest or
Minister takes his seat, and the music (solo, trio or organ)
begins.
As the music ends, the Priest or Minister arises, proceeds
to the Altar and reads a selected portion from one of the
books of the New Testament.
The reading is followed by music; semi-classical or vocal
solo.
Offertory during the music.
Following the music, the Priest or Minister proceeds with

Law, applicable to man's daily action and his relationship

The ceremony for receiving a member into the Church of
Illumination is a very simple one. This ceremony, following

as befits the occasion. This is true whether one or many mem-

December the sun literally is at its lowest point and sym-

three days; that is, remains stationary in time for three days,
after which it again begins to increase in time.
Anciently, this was a time of great sorrow, because the
people of that day had no way of knowing whether or not
the sun would remain stationary in time, in which event it
would have meant continued, unremitting cold, with ultimate
death to all things.

When the sun, after three days, began its ascent, or resur-
rection, there was a time of great rejoicing. Officially, this is
the beginning of winter. Actually, it is the beginning of a
new year in time, because the sun, instead of continuing to
decrease, begins to increase and so holds the promise of a
renewal of life amongst all living things.
2. The World is known as the Macrocosm. The sun is
the Soul of the universe. It rises in the East, goes to the
South, arriving at midday, the period of youth, love and
affection. Continuing to the West, it sets there at eventide,
to again arise in the morning, completing the circle, symboliz-
ing eternity.
Man is known as the Microcosm, or little world. IN him
is the sun of his little world. This is his Soul. Regrettably
must it be said that for the great majority, the Soul is not
awakened; the rebirth, or arising, does not take place; the
circle of eternity is not consummated. Should the Soul be
awakened and brought into Consciousness, it then becomes
the Ineffable or Holy Light. At birth it is in the East. Dur-
ing life it completes the circle to set in the West, only to rise
again at its new birth.
The Nazarene's life symbolized both the Drama of the
Heavens, and the experience of man's awakened Soul. To
fully symbolize this, HE LIVED THE LIFE. HE BROUGHT
LIGHT TO MAN. HE DIED. LlKE THE SUN; DESCENDED
INTO THE DARK OF THE GRAVE, OR HELL. HE AROSE ON
THE THIRD DAY, HAVING COMPLETED THE CIRCLE,

are celebrated in memory of this life, symbolizing man's
REbirth, or Second birth.

fourth, when the sun begins to take on new life. This new
life has its real beginning at about the time of Easter. It is

God. Fittingly, at this time, when life is renewed, the Sacra-
ments should be celebrated as a thanksgiving and devotional
rejoicing.
The Sacraments may also be celebrated at any other time
of the year; always in thanksgiving and heart-felt devotion.
The celebration of the Sacraments should, in all cases,
be followed by the Benediction.
The Altar should be prepared before anyone, other than
those helping the Priest or Minister, are allowed to enter. At
the proper time the Priest or Minister proceeds to the Altar
and Consecrates the Bread and Wine for the special purpose
intended. Communion is then served, to be followed by the
Benediction, which closes the service.
The Marriage Ceremony
The Church of Illumination is a Congregation, rather
than a formal church. Its membership is largely composed of
adherents rather than members. The services must necessarily
be all-inclusive, because many of the adherents are actually
members of other churches. To satisfy all needs, the church
has a formal marriage ceremony for those who are members,
and another for non-members.
All marriages, formal or otherwise, should take place in
the church and during a church service, if at all possible.
Christening Service
As with marriage, so with the Christening service. There
is a formal service for members and another one for adher-
ents, or those who desire such a service, but are not adherents.

is a service for non-members. There is a service for members
of the church and, lastly, a service for the Priests, Ministers,
and those in the Great Work, who have attained to Soul
Consciousness and who do not desire a Funeral Service, but
merely a Departure Service, which is simplicity itself.
Committal Services
This service naturally follows the Funeral Service in the
two first instances, but not the Farewell Departing Service.
Memorial Services
The Church of Illumination offers its service to all who
deske and request a Memorial Service.
All Souls' Night Service
All Souls' Night Service is, in intent, a glorified Memorial
Service. It is held once a year on the night of November
second. This is primarily intended for Priests, Ministers,
Philosophic Initiates and members of the various Philosophic
Fraternities and their friends. No other services may be held
on this night. It is a devotional requiem for loved ones who
have passed on, but who must continue their cycle of life
and works.
In all of its services, the Church of Illumination attempts
to illustrate by word and action the philosophic, esoteric,
spiritual and occult interpretation of what is generally termed
Sacred literature, of which the Bible is a part.

PRAYER TO THE LORD
(Restatement of the Lord's Prayer)
Our Father, who art everywhere present; whose just
Laws govern all things; hallowed be Thy name in our hearts.
May Thy promised kingdom come upon earth and abide
with us as we, Thy children, learn to do Thy Will and obey
Thy Laws. May the earth become a Heaven through the
elimination of sin and suffering.
Give us this day the strength and the opportunity to
honestly earn our daily bread and all else that is of benefit to
body, mind and Soul.
Bless us, Oh Father, by permitting Thy Light to shine
upon us. Give us the courage to overcome all temptations.
Help us to free ourselves from all that is evil, so that we may
glorify Thee through the gradual but certain unfoldment
toward perfection of mind, body and Soul. Help us to obey
Thy Will in our thoughts, words and deeds.
Thine, Oh Father, is the kingdom of heaven and earth.
Thine is the power, and Thine is the glory; may we, Thy
children, become like unto Thee.
Unto Thee we give our thanks and our praise as we
humbly bow our heads with contrite hearts, in submission
to Thy Will in all things that concern us. Amen. Amen.
Amen.

Awaken, O my Soul! Accept the Wisdom and the Love
that will help thee to become Divine. Lift up thyself to the
Throne of the Father, and there seek His understanding, that
thou mayest teach the Law to all men.
Free thyself from all that is evil and ignoble; from all
hatred, malice, ill-will, resentment, unjust judgment, preju-
dice, and all carnal passions that are not from the Father; for
God is the Law, and he who defies the Law shall be punished
by the Law.
By obedience to the Law, thou, my Soul, shalt be raised
from the dust of the earth and become one of the Sons of the
Father, and one of the Heavenly Hierarchies.
All power comes to the Soul only as it obeys the Law.
By obedience to the Law, will the splendor and the glory of
the Sanctuary shine upon it.
Might, power and all other Divine inheritances come to
the Soul that trusts in the Father and harmonizes its desires
with His Laws.
The Father is all power; Sovereign over all, and thou, my
Soul, hast the privilege to harmonize thyself with God and
His Law.
Then praise God for all His kindness to thee. Free thy-
self from all that is undesirable. Accept freely that which

The Sacraments must be offered Neophytes and Members
of the Church of Illumination at least twice a year: Christmas

The Altar is fully prepared before any one other than the
Priest, Minister or selected Officers is permitted to enter.
The Priest or Minister stands before the Altar, facing the
Congregation. The bread is placed on the Altar at his left
hand; the wine on his right, both between the Cross and
candles which form the base of a triangle.
When all is in readiness, the congregation is permitted

is played throughout the Consecration of the bread and wine
and while the Sacraments are offered to the Congregation.
With his arms raised in Adoration and Reverence, the

starting to Consecrate the bread and wine.
Following the Consecration of the bread and wine, the
candles at the apex of the triangle are moved back of the
Cross, towards the Priest or Minister, while the bread and
wine are moved to the front of the Altar.
A kneeling stool is placed before the Altar. If the Priest
or Minister has chosen to have his Deacons or other Officials
assist him, he will request the two selected to step forward;
one to serve the bread; the other, the wine.
Those desiring to partake of the Sacraments then come
forward, one by one; or, in large congregations, two at a
time; they kneel before the Altar and receive Communion.

OF ILLUMINATION

I, of my own free will
and accord, after fully studying the texts of the Church of
Illumination, and finding myself in complete harmony with
the teachings, seek membership in the Church of Illumin-
ation.
I pledge myself to think, desire, feel and act in accord-
ance with the Divine Law as taught by the Church of Illum-
ination, doing this to the best of my understanding and abil-
ity, despite anything and everything that others may think,
say or do.
I will endeavor not to be influenced by what others may
say or do, at all times remembering the saying of the Nazar-
ene: "What is that to thee? Follow thou me." If at any time
it is within my power to prevent, I will not permit injustice
to be done either to others or myself, lest I help the wicked
become more wicked.
I will support the Church of Illumination morally and
spiritually, and, when possible, will contribute to the financial
support by means of tithes.
I will, to the best of my ability, instruct my children
(if any) in the Divine Laws as taught by the Church of
Illumination, though never compel, or even insist, that they
become members. I will at all times remember that God gave
to them Free Will, as He did to me.

FORMAL MARRIAGE CEREMONY
For Members of the Church of Illumination
and Those Willing to Assume its Obligations
Priest or Minister
"Friends, Neighbors and Members of the Church, Priests
and Princes of the Priesthood of Melchizedek, we are gath-
ered together by agreement to witness the confirmation and
solemnization of this man and this woman, in the bonds of
Sacred matrimony; a ceremony exemplifying a state of heart
already existing in the hearts of the two who stand before
us. If this feeling which we call Love did not exist in their
hearts, solemnizing this marriage would be impossible.
"Marriage is not to be entered into lightly; but with
reverence founded in deep affection; discreetly, soberly, with
full understanding between the two directly concerned, and
with full respect for the Laws of God. These two before us
have requested us to join them into this Sacred estate. Should
there be any cause known why this marriage should not take
place, then let it be known now, or silence be maintained
ever after.
To Those About to be Married
"I entreat and charge you both, that you answer me as
truthfully as you must answer on that day when the secrets
of all hearts will be revealed. To the best of your knowledge,
is there any reason why you should not be joined in
Marriage?"
Applicants
"We know of no such reason."

MARRIAGE CEREMONY
For Others than Members of the Church
Priest or Minister â€” to the People Present
"Friends, we are gathered together to confirm and sol-
emnize a contract of marriage between two, who, because of
their love for each other, have already been wedded before
God. The two before us are fully prepared to enter into
this sacred union, making the two as one. Such a union is
well illustrated by the poet:
"I saw two clouds at morn,
In the dawn they floated on;
And ere the day was done,
They had mingled into one."
"Marriage, in Law, is a civil contract. In love, it is a Soul
union; for God is Love. This marriage is Sacred and un-
breakable so long as love binds the two. When Love is
the basis of marriage, and if the civil ceremony is likewise
performed, confirmed and solemnized by a religious rite, those
so united are triply bound, both before God and their fellow
men.
"Love is the only means to true happiness. It must be
kept burning brightly by continued courtship; with the same
display of affection after, no less than before, marriage. One
in sentiment, one in heart; preferring each other before the
self, and solving all differences by fair compromise. It is
well to agree beforehand to give and to take; to bear and
forebear, to share all things both good and ill; that peace and
harmony may prevail.

"The sun of life has set and bells have tolled the depart-

have been broken asunder by Nature's Law. The star that
shone so brightly in life's night has ceased to shed its light
upon this earth. Though its changing course has removed
this life from our field of view, we know that the Soul lives;
that there is no death; that 'the grave' has no victory over the
Soul, and that death, so-called, has no stings. In this knowl-
edge, those left behind may find solace for their loss and
grief.
"The family, friends and companions who had learned
to love the departed must now bow in silence to a higher
command; knowing that the angel of death, though of dark-
ened mien, sets the spirit free from bondage and pain. It is
in this sad hour that our sweetest comfort can come only
from God. Let us then bow in heart-felt prayer."
Prayer by Priest or Minister
"Father of Light and Life; Creator of heaven and earth;
Thou hast given man all he is, all he has, and offered unto
him all there is. Soothe Thou these troubled Souls; these
sorrowful hearts. Help them to bow in humble submission
to Thy Law. Let them feel Thy Tender Spirit, so that they
may know that Thou doeth all things well. Help them to
see beyond the plainly visible and feel the life-throbs that are
eternal. Be Thou near those who by ties of fellowship and
love have been left bereaved.
"Console those who by ties of birth have been parted by
the reaper. Teach them to look to Thee for help and hope
until they, too, shall be called to that realm of greater
experience. Amen. Amen. Amen."

"Softly, as the petals fall, that which came from the
earth returns to earth; dust to dust; ashes to ashes; thus
completing the cycle in fulfilling the Law.
"Softly, as the petals fall, the Soul ascends to its appointed
place to continue its journey in the Immortal realm by
~ireetion of an immutable Law.
"Softly, as the petals fall, the pleasant memories of the
departed lingers among us, reminding us of all that was good
and noble.
"May the Eternal Light ever over-shadow the departed
Soul, and be its guide onward and forward to its destined
end. Amen." The Twelve Chimes.!

TEMPLE AND CHURCH SERVICE
Prepared for the Purpose of Personal Dedication
and Responsive Reading
Introduction and Explanation to the
Responsive Reading
As man awakens or becomes conscious of the truth that
the life ordinarily lived by humanity is not a full life accord-
ing to the WAY, the TRUTH and the LIFE, he first bethinks
himself, and finally sets forth in search of the "Truth that
shall make him free."
He will seek, and make the necessary effort to gain an
understanding of the Divine Law which governs in all things
in man's life, no less than in every manifestation in the entire
realm of nature.
This stage of man's life we know as the Conception,
Awakening or Baptism by Water; water symbolizing the
mind. Baptism by water symbolizes mentally coming to life.
It may truthfully be called the Immaculate Conception,
because there must first be purity of thought and desire
before there can be a consciousness of the Divine, or that
which pertains to the Divine.
As man becomes conscious of a better life, a more com-
plete and more satisfying existence, there also comes an
awakening of the sleeping Christ, or Christos WITHIN him-
self. This is clearly implied in the Biblical statement: "Ye
are the temples of the living God."
Such a man, once he has "become conscious," will find
no rest until he begins his search for reality. His first efforts
are almost wholly in the dark. He can see only as "through a
glass darkly," and he finds it necessary to supplicate (pray to)

on the Way, so that he may follow in the true path and grow
into the consciousness of his relationship with God and his
fellow men.
His first efforts are to develop his devotional self by
prayerâ€”not a prayer simply uttered by words of the lips, but
a prayer which expresses the innermost FEELING OF THE
HEART.
For a time, he may continue to believe that the Father
dwells in some distant realm, rather than within his own
being. This belief will likely persist until, by effort, he
becomes conscious of a spiritual self within his material self.
Through this development, man attains to, or experiences,
the Second, or Spiritual Birth. This attained, he will, for the
first time, understand what the Nazarene meant when he
said:
Except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he
cannot enter into the kingdom of God.â€”St. John 3:5.

Man, puny and insignificant as he is, is a perfect replica
of the universe and its sun. In general, men are like a world
wherein there is a sun, but a sun hidden so deeply in darkness
that it never shines. In truth, they are not even aware that
there is a sun, the very Christos, hidden within. When they
at last awaken to a consciousness of this hidden Light WITHIN
themselves, and begin to make an effort to clear away the
debris under which it is hidden, then will the sunâ€”the
Christosâ€”be aroused and begin to shed its Light upon not
only the possessor, but upon all others as well. This is the
mission of all men on earth; more especially, those appointed
and those who dedicate themselves to God's services.
To him who is faithful in his efforts, the Light will arise
as does the sun of the universe in the East each morning.
With each day and renewed efforts, the Light will become
brighter and brighter until it will envelope the material,
physical and carnal self. At the end of man's day, though
the (his) sun will set in the West; after he has passed through
the veil of darkness through which all Souls must pass, the
Light will shine as brilliantly as ever before the Great
Change.

In youth we expect miracles; a brilliant future without
any great effort on our part. It is only as we approach the
middle of life we begin to realize that miracles are neither
more nor less than natural results wrought by our own patient
and painstaking effort; nor would we appreciate it were it
otherwise.
As time passes, understanding unfolds within us as do
the petals of the rose in the well-kept garden, and we become
conscious that life is only what we make it; that death, so-
called, alters nothing. Whatever follows our transition is by
reason of what we have desired, felt and brought about by
our own efforts, during our earthly span of life.
As age keeps apace with the course of life, we begin to

us life and opportunity. Youth is incapable of recognizing
this; only passing time, experience and sorrows open our eyes
to realities and dispel the shadows; freeing us from the
illusions of the gross senses; enabling the heart to respond
to the real and eternal.
As time passes, what can the individual do? // it be our
Will, we may learn aright to number our years before they
fall, and fill each day with the glory that is in the heart.
In youth we lived for pleasure, adventure, power, for
fame and glory; above all, ambition that oft bears bitter
fruit. As the years pass, experience teaches us that none of
these things were what we thought them to be. At last we
begin to bethink ourselves, and well that this be so, for now
we learn to truly value friendship and companionship, and
to more fully appreciate the warmth of all that friendship and
fellowship mean to us; more especially the friendship of those
near and dear to us; those we love unselfishly, though they
are perhaps unaware of it.
No longer do we think of our acts in terms of "what will
it profit us," but instead: "Today I have brought harm to
none; offered good-will to all."
Youth cannot understand this. Youth must gradually ripen

words alone, but in spirit, a Holy three: Love, Memory and
the Feeling of a warm friendship never to be forgotten, light

jeel not thus, then all is naught. These gone hence are not
dead; but LIVING; PRESSING FORWARD, on this Feast Day of

There comes a moment in the lives of all men when
body and Soul must sever their relationship; for the body
ages, while the Soul renews itself. The body must return to

indeed lost friends and brethren; mayhaps a loved one; but

May God's, the Creator's Blessing be upon these Souls;
May they be forgiven all their trespasses to the full extent
of the Law;
May these Souls quickly press onward and forward so
that they shall quickly return;
Take up their labors with renewed courage and energy,
and re-commence their climb toward higher realms;
Toward final and complete achievement; either to become
associated with the Spiritual Hierarchies of the Great
White Brotherhood; or:
Return to earth to teach, to help and guide seeking Souls
on the Path upward to their final goal. Amen.

OPEN IT.
Let US be convinced that death is not an enemy, but a
friend in disguise; offering us the new in exchange for the
old. Men accuse, because, lacking vision, and subservient to
the many weaknesses which hold them in bondage, they are
unprepared for the unexpected visitation.

SERMON
We are come together on this day, not to mourn the
departed, but to pay our final respect to those who, during
life, had 'our deepest respect. In losing them, we have
indeed lost friends and brethren; mayhaps a loved one; but
our loss, great as it may be, however heavy it may be, is their
gain. If, in our hearts, we feel the kindness and graciousness
that should be there, then we will rejoice in our sorrow, and
our thoughts and prayer will be:
May God's, the Creator's Blessing be upon these Souls;
May they be forgiven all their trespasses to the full extent
of the Law;
May these Souls quickly press onward and forward so
that they shall quickly return;
Take up their labors with renewed courage and energy,
and re-commence their climb toward higher realms;
Toward final and complete achievement; either to become
associated with the Spiritual Hierarchies of the Great
White Brotherhood; or:
Return to earth to teach, to help and guide seeking Souls
on the Path upward to their final goal. Amen.

BEFORE THE COFFIN
Death, thou art not a grim reaper. Only those left
behind think of thee as such. Thou hast no stings; but kindly
offer us a change for the better. Sorrow alone is left for
those bereft of our love and friendship.
(Pause)
(Those present may each pass before the coffin and
lay a rose upon it, then pass on to their seats.)
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, thus Nature recalls her own.
The Soul gaining its freedom, returns to its original realm; to
its glorious Light; its home once more for a short time.
Man dreads the reaper only because he has refused to
obey the dictates of his Conscience, and is enshrouded in
darkness, instead of the Light; that Light which would open
his eyes to the glories that lie beyond and await the seeking
Soul.
Were man wise, prayerfulness for the departed would
f,ll his heart instead of the heavy sorrow that lies upon it.
The parting would indeed be sweet in the knowledge that
the Soul departed would awaken to greater blessings and to
a wider opportunity of service.
Music: The Angelus
Priest or Minister
Well may the poet say:
"Though torrents fall, the fountains play,
To keep us goodly company,
Till both, articulate in thee,
Upon thy lips their story tell,
And picture Heaven, though they shadow hell.

THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES OF
THE CHURCH OF ILLUMINATION
The Church of Illumination recognizes that within man
there is a Divine Spark which is part of the Father or Cosmic
Soul, and that every effort should be made to bring this Spark
into Consciousness.
The attainment of this Consciousness is termed Individu-
alization, Soul Consciousness, Illumination, or the Manifesta-
tion of the Godhood in man.
The first requisite in attaining the privilege and the
ability to achieve this Soul Consciousness is for man to free
himself from bondage; not alone from Kings, Priests, from
any and all association of men, but from the even greater
bondage to the evils existing within himself. These are the
carnal passions, hatreds, jealousies andâ€”yet stronger passion
â€”the desire to dominate over his fellow-men.
This freedom, however, in nowise seeks the overthrow of
either Church or Government. Rather, it gives birth to a
passionate desire for a Government which guarantees the
freedom of all men; as, for instance, the freedom assured
man by the written Declaration of Independence of the
United States of America.
The Divine Law is for the government of man. Order is
heaven's first law. To be in harmony man must live within
the Law. Legislative enactmentsâ€”man-made lawsâ€”are for
those who refuse to obey the Divine Law! All of those who
obey the Divine Law, likewise obey all righteous civil laws.
Man is not made for the law, but the laws are made for
the proper conduct of man. In like manner, man is not the
servant, nor the minion, of either church or government, but
the church and government are the servants of man.

TITHING
Tithing is an ancient institution. In modern times, it is
compulsory in very few churches. However, it is becoming
more and more generally recognized by aspirants, and even
by wealthy, successful men of business, that tithing brings
definitely gratifying returns. Those members of this organi-
zation who have commenced the tithing system of their own
accord and by their own free will, have continued it because
they have found that "bread cast upon the waters will return
manyfold."
