  		              		Experience Description   

    I was doing back flips in the gym and asked my friend to spot me. She  had no gymnastic knowledge. I landed wrong and had the wind knocked out of me. We went to the teacher because I couldn't breathe. 

The next thing I remember was floating to the top of the gym's high ceiling.  I saw myself and the whole gym from above. I was embarrassed as I thought, 'What am I doing on the floor?' Then I rushed back into my body, opened my eyes, and jumped up.  I went on with my day.
