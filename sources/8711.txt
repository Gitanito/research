  Narrative Responses to Love Survey Question:    Narrative responses by near-death experiencers (NDErs) to the NDERF survey question below

  Comments:    Introductory comments to near-death experience (NDE)

    This page contains 522 near-death experiences (NDEs) and their responses to the NDERF survey question “During your experience, did you encounter any specific information / awareness regarding love?”  All narrative responses with a “Yes” or “Uncertain” response to this question are included.

      Methodology: 

      Experiences were scored as near-death experiences (NDEs) if they met all of the following:

  1.  A lucid, organized experience occurring at the time of a life-threatening event so severe that there is unconsciousness or clinically apparent death with an absent heartbeat.

  2.  An NDE Scale score of 7 or higher.

  3.  Shared by the individual who personally had the NDE.

  4.  Shared in English via the completed survey form on nderf.org.

  These are NDEs from the most recent version of the NDERF survey (nderf.org). They are sequentially shared NDEs from November 11, 2011 to April 8, 2021. All accounts were scored as NDEs if they met the above criteria and regardless of experience content to avoid bias in studying the content of the NDEs.

    The NDEs posted on the NDERF website are edited to correct obvious spelling and grammar errors. As remarkable as the NDEs are in this list, please remember that they accurately represent the real experiences of near-death experiencersfrom all walks of life and around the world.  

  We strive to make a larger collection of NDEs that include statements from NDErs about encountering love during their NDEs. We would be delighted to collaborate in this endeavor with anyone with other credible internet sources of NDErs discussing the love they encountered during thier NDEs.

      This list is public domain and may be used by anyone.

  Substantial efforts are made to minimize the risk of posting fraudulent NDE accounts on nderf.org: See a more detailed explanation. 

  We strive for accuracy in this list. If any NDEs should not be included for any reason, please email us at nderf@nderf.org with the NDE registry number and URL. Thanks!

    Even a brief review of the NDEs below shows that NDErs often encounter profound love during their NDEs.  The narrative responses below were directly shared on the NDERF survey without grammatical or spelling corrections.

WHen we don't feel it, we lose part of our spiritual strength and when we don't give it, we weaken and lose our focus. If everyone LOVED as best they can, we would be like a human-powered love machine, bringing about the natural end of the universe, and thus, paradise/heaven. We aren't there yet.

The challenge is to make it happen here on earth in this human form. Good luck. Do your best. Be love. When we are all one in unity (without body) dispersed throughout the universe there will be no pain. But, there will be no bodies separated as individual objects to bump into each other, no tingly tongues to excite your groins. No, tiny babies to smell. No proud moment when your son brings home an A on his report card. This human experience is just that. A human experience. This is your time here. Love.

NDE due to respiratory arrest after surgery.  		  		  			7578  			Scott W NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1scott_w_nde.html  			We have spent that time, being so separated from love and our truth that we have taken it from others, because we can’t stand that they may have it and we don’t. We have created false truths and realities because we loathe what we think are the truth. We have nearly if not completely ruined our lives, hearts, minds, and souls to keep feeding the illusions to keep this false love and realty alive, just to do it. We have given our bodies away for validation and approval, our soul just to feel better. If we can’t heal and return to love here where it counts, when we don’t own and atone, for our mistakes, we keep the separation going and the pain we feel gets worse and the more desperate we become to cover it up. Yet, I saw that for me, for us to return to that source, love, to the place where it all began, we had to do just that. Face the truth of where it all began.

It was very clear that the Cosmic composition was made up of nothing but Love! Love is the God-glue that was holding All… together.

Once we have been through the earth game long enough to realize sugar attracts more flies than vinegar, we begin to get the idea. Older souls rarely get back anything but love, because that's what they give out. I've come to realize that the enlightened soul sees nothing but the sweetness and others, because he doesn't recognize anything that's not also in himself.

NDE due to motorcycle accident.  		  		  			9105  			Chris C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1chris_c_nde_9105.html  			Again not superficial, but just the awareness of a kind of love that is all encompassing, unconditional, completely pure. A kind of love one does not experience on this earth i believe, unless connected to the other dimension through NDE or other ways. I know mystics like Jesus talked of love, but i don’t know for sure what they meant. But i do think i know what other NDEs mean.  			NDE at age 9 due to childhood ‘game’ of inducing unconsciousness. Exceptional discussion of aspects of his NDE.  		  		  			9108  			Anelia G NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1anelia_g_nde.html  			I experienced unconditional love and was aware that my human parents were also capable of unconditional love. It is hard for me to describe it because at that time I had not known the opposite of love. It was as if only love existed. It is really on earth that we learn the meaning of lack of love.  			Exceptional NDE when she was just over one year old due to head injury. This NDE is among the best documented and detailed ever reported that occurred so early in life.  		  		  			9111  			John W NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1john_w_nde_9111.html  			It was so peaceful there, I suppose that a feeling of love or its expression was a part of the experience.  			NDE due to sudden episode of unconsciousness followed by 40 foot fall.  		  		  			9119  			Anne W NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1anne_w_nde.html  			please read my near death experience, IT'S ALL THERE  			Exceptional NDE during unconsciousness at time of an apparent heart attack.

NDE due to being shot with shotgun in criminal attack.  		  		  			9155  			Val C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1val_c_nde.html  			I was given the awareness that love is the most important thing and what it is all about. I understood that we need to love everyone unconditionally. I also came back with the understanding that we aren't just to love people but love life. I had been depressed and I not only worked on loving my father when I came back, but on loving my crazy life. I started by developing a sense of humor about the crappy and difficult things. I did crazy stuff to make myself laugh and have fun. For example, I love chocolate, so I took a bath in chocolate syrup and couldn't stop laughing at how silly this was. I did somersaults and cartwheels in a field and just anything that made me feel like a happy-go-lucky kid again. I reminded myself to look for and appreciate the beauty in the world as I had before I had become a sullen, depressed teenager. The other thing is, we try to avoid painful things, but that is where the treasure is. If you stop fighting the painful stuff and instead accept it, welcome it in, and feel it, that is how you find truth. I don't mean that we should create pain for ourselves or others, but that when something emotionally painful happens, dive into it. It's an opportunity to love and understand.
