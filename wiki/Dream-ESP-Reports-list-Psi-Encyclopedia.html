Sidgwick, Eleanor. ON THE EVIDENCE FOR PREMONITIONS,&nbsp;Proceedings&nbsp;5, 1889, pp. 288-354.&nbsp;Sidgwick considers a class of anecdotal evidence gathered by the Society which is suggestive of <a href='Precognition-Psi-Encyclopedia.html'>precognition</a>, if not in her view as convincing as the evidence of telepathy. About two thirds of the material is dreams and the remainder various kinds of hallucination. The character of apparitional cases is similar to that of crisis apparitions, with the added element that the event perceived is some hours or days in <a href='The-Future-The-Future-Home-Journal-IAPSOP-.html'>the future</a>. Headings include: recognised apparitions (293), unrecognised apparitions (300), symbolic visual hallucinations (302), <a href='Precognition-Psi-Encyclopedia.html'>precognition</a> of sounds (305), symbolic sounds (306), general discussion of dreams (311), recognition of dream scenery (314), dreams foreshadowing <a href='Phenomena-Relating-to-Danger.html'>death</a>s (317), dreams of accidents (332), dreams of trivial incidents (343), symbolic dreams (351).&nbsp;spontaneous psi/<a href='Precognition-Psi-Encyclopedia.html'>precognition</a>/apparitions/hallucinations/dreams<br>

Sidgwick, Eleanor. ON THE EVIDENCE FOR CLAIRVOYANCE,&nbsp;Proceedings&nbsp;7, 1891, pp. 30-99.&nbsp;Documents several cases in which subjects become telepathically aware, through dreams or hallucinations, of accidents, <a href='Phenomena-Relating-to-Danger.html'>death</a>s and other objective <a href='Facts-IAPSOP-.html'>facts</a>. Includes the ‘Wilmot’ case, discussed by commentators to the present day, in which a woman felt herself to be transported to the side of her sleeping husband aboard a ship on a transatlantic crossing. Independently her husband dreamed that she entered his cabin and caressed him and, when he woke, a man sharing his cabin remarked that he was ‘a pretty fellow to have a lady come and visit you in this way.’ Reports of amateur experiments involving a hypnotized subject are also given, in which the subject seemed to become aware of <a href='Facts-IAPSOP-.html'>facts</a> she could not normally have known. Telepathy is indicated in some cases, but there are several in which the <a href='Facts-IAPSOP-.html'>facts</a> were not known, or known inaccurately by other people involved, and were given correctly by the subject.

Myers, Frederic W.H. THE SUBLIMINAL SELF: CHAPTER 8 - THE RELATION OF SUPERNORMAL PHENOMENA TO TIME RETROCOGNITION AND <a href='Precognition-Psi-Encyclopedia.html'>precognition</a>,Proceedings&nbsp;11, 1895, pp. 334-593.&nbsp;Six years have elapsed since <a href='Eleanor-Sidgwick-Psi-Encyclopedia.html'>Eleanor Sidgwick</a>’s paper inProceedings&nbsp;5 ‘On the evidence for Premonitions’, in which time twice as much anecdotal material has been assembled as she had available to her. Myers offers some reflections, followed by anecdotal cases. A priest hears the first lines of a letter spoken to him hours before he receives it in the post (346); a woman describes the sensation of being a child again and calling out to her sister at night, and receives a letter from her sister saying she had been awakened the night before by the sound of her name being called (355); a man dreams he is involved in a train accident that causes a fatality, and later finds the details confirmed in an actual accident that happened at the same time (370); a man in a <a href='Light-IAPSOP-.html'>light</a> sleep dreams of an accident to a diver in a harbour, which corresponds with an actual accident (378); a dentist working on the manufacture of false teeth obeys the command of an unseen voice to run to the window, narrowly escaping injury when his chemical apparatus explodes (424); a man dreams he makes a business visit and is asked to look at a number of photographic transparencies, an event which takes place in <a href='Reality-IAPSOP-.html'>reality</a> unexpectedly some days later (458); etc. SUMMARY &amp; DISCUSSION,Journal&nbsp;7, 1895, pp. 82-5.&nbsp;spontaneous psi/<a href='Precognition-Psi-Encyclopedia.html'>precognition</a>/telepathy/dreams<br>

Saltmarsh, H.F. REPORT ON CASES OF APPARENT <a href='Precognition-Psi-Encyclopedia.html'>precognition</a>,&nbsp;Proceedings&nbsp;42, 1934, pp. 49-103.&nbsp;A total of 349 cases of ostensible <a href='Precognition-Psi-Encyclopedia.html'>precognition</a> reported in the Society’s records are classified and analysed. The majority are found to be in dreams (136), followed by hallucination (87), <a href='Medium-Prague-IAPSOP-.html'>medium</a>ship (62) and impression (51). A few <a href='Borderland-IAPSOP-.html'>borderland</a> (hypnagogic) and crystal gazing cases are also reported. Of the dream cases, 76 are reported to be highly evidential and 40 significantly so. Hallucinations are 17 and 45 respectively, <a href='Medium-Prague-IAPSOP-.html'>medium</a>ship 20 and 31, and impressions 14 and 25 (see table on page 51). The most numerous of the incidents foreseen is <a href='Phenomena-Relating-to-Danger.html'>death</a>, mainly natural but also accidental, followed closely by incidents classed as trivial. The author discusses the character of the material and suggests that quantum theory may be the key to understanding the space-time principle that makes <a href='Precognition-Psi-Encyclopedia.html'>precognition</a> possible.

Actual cases are provided to illustrate the kind of material analysed. Green concludes that the study is primarily of value for its suggestiveness, and for hints about how to conduct further studies.&nbsp;Appendices provide figures and graphs, also a summary of cases.&nbsp;In one, a young office worker dreams that the sister of a co-worker appears to be distressed and notes next to her the date on his desk calendar, set to April 1. When that day comes, the girl concerned appears in the office, seeming to have been crying, as represented in the dream.

PREMONITIONS OF THE ABERFAN DISASTER,&nbsp;Journal&nbsp;44, 1967, pp. 169-81.The Aberfan disaster - in which an avalanche of coal slid down a mountainside onto the Welsh mining village of Aberfan killing 144 persons, 128 of whom were schoolchildren - was such an unusual calamity that the author <a href='Thought-Alameda-IAPSOP-.html'>thought</a> it would provide an excellent <a href='Opportunity-IAPSOP-.html'>opportunity</a> to investigate <a href='Precognition-Psi-Encyclopedia.html'>precognition</a>. He appealed through the media for persons claiming any foreknowledge of the event to communicate with him and describe their experiences. Of the answers received, 35 contained sufficient detail to warrant analysis. These ranged from vague prognostications of doom involving dead or dying children to astonishingly accurate pictorial impressions of screaming children buried by an avalanche of coal in a Welsh mining village. In 21 of the cases there is evidence that the experience occurred before the percipient learned of the disaster normally. The author discusses the cases in <a href='The-Light-of-the-East-IAPSOP-.html'>the light of the</a> several criteria necessary to establish a connection between a precognitive experience and a future event. Concludes that the evidence for <a href='Precognition-Psi-Encyclopedia.html'>precognition</a> presented in this study is prima facie only, and recommends that a central registry for premonitions be established so that researchers will no longer have to wait until after the event.&nbsp;(PsiLine)&nbsp;spontaneous psi/<a href='Precognition-Psi-Encyclopedia.html'>precognition</a><br>

After a brief description of her method of collection, Wood-Trost summarizes 18 individual cases of varying types (dreams, intuitions, etc.), time of experience relative to event (from a few moments to a year), and varying detail (from vague premonition to dreams containing one or more specific and veridical details). The author discusses the demographics of her experiencers and the phenomenology of the cases as well as their relationship to similar cases collected in 1967 after the Aberfan disaster in Wales by J.C. Barker and to general characteristics of L.E. Rhine’s collection. She compares time lapses between experiences and events to current thinking on likely clustering of <a href='Precognition-Psi-Encyclopedia.html'>precognition</a> relative to time of the event. In addition, she discusses possible normal explanations, among them subliminal awareness of clues pointing to the disaster and first or second-hand&nbsp; technical knowledge of the dam’s construction and likelihood of failure.&nbsp;(PsiLine)&nbsp;spontaneous psi/dreams/<a href='Precognition-Psi-Encyclopedia.html'>precognition</a><br>

Artemis in 1971 is reported. A fortnight before the incident, the female percipient (then aged 17) had met some of the crew at a dance when the vessel visited Grimsby, and had become friendly with one submariner. She had a dream a week before the incident in which she saw the submarine sink, in harbour. In the dream, she ‘knew’ that three men were trapped inside, that two of them were men she had met, and that two of the men would die. The percipient related the dream to several persons over the next few days. On July 1, 1971 the submarine did sink in Gosport harbour, and three men were trapped inside for 101/2 hours. There were no fatalities though. The percipient knew two of the trapped men, but they were not the two she had named.

Another dream described the shooting of a ‘pockmarked actor,’ while getting out of a car, by a ‘German S.S. man.’ President Reagan (former actor) was shot by John W. Hinckley (former member of a neo-Nazi group) three weeks later. In another dream three weeks before the fire on board the liner Achille Lauro, the percipient saw two coffins on that ship. Two passengers died in the fire and another was lost overboard. Aspects of the ostensible <a href='Precognition-Psi-Encyclopedia.html'>precognition</a>s are discussed. Personality and background information about the percipient is provided.&nbsp;spontaneous psi/dreams/<a href='Precognition-Psi-Encyclopedia.html'>precognition</a><br>

Pablos, Fernando de. SPONTANEOUS <a href='Precognition-Psi-Encyclopedia.html'>precognition</a> DURING DREAMS: ANALYSIS OF A ONE-YEAR NATURALISTIC STUDY,&nbsp;Journal&nbsp;62, 1998, pp. 423-34.&nbsp;Author’s abstract: The author has undertaken an analysis of his own dreams in order to discover spontaneous <a href='Precognition-Psi-Encyclopedia.html'>precognition</a>. The dreams occurring during the calendar years January-December 1996 were investigated. A total of 223 dreams were registered during that period. <a href='Out-of-the-Silence-Voisin-IAPSOP-.html'>Out of the</a>se, 23 dreams were considered precognitive by explicit criteria previously determined. Brief reports of the dreams and of the precognized events are given. <a href='Out-of-the-Silence-Voisin-IAPSOP-.html'>Out of the</a> 23 dreams, in 14 (60.80%) the precognized event occurred within 24 hours after the dream, in 5 (21.74%) the precognized event occurred within two weeks after the dream and in 4 (17.34%) the precognized event occurred within two and a half months after the dream. An analysis of the phenomenological characteristics of precognitive dreams allows us to classify them into two broad categories: realistic and analogical/realistic. A particular emphasis was made in analysing the phenomenological and psychological characteristics of precognized events. Most precognized events were unexpected, sudden and anxiety-provoking events which tend to disrupt the attentional process in the subject. Roughly half of precognized events were under volitional control of other people and the other half could be explained by chance occurrence. We found no case of a precognized event under the possible volitional control of the subject.&nbsp;spontaneous psi/<a href='Precognition-Psi-Encyclopedia.html'>precognition</a>/dreams            			  			     			This page was last updated on: May 28, 2023   			 			                                               	       Search form        Search                   Article Information           	Author: The <a href='Society-for-Psychical-Research-Psi-Encyclopedia.html'>Society for Psychical Research</a> Word count: 5,800 Created: 22nd August 2016 Last updated: 28th May 2023 May be cited as:<a href='Society-for-Psychical-Research-Psi-Encyclopedia.html'>Society for Psychical Research</a>, T.
