Charles Beasmore Bailey was born in 1870 in Melbourne and raised as a Methodist. As an eighteen-year-old shoe-maker’s apprentice he attended his first séance, and having been told that he himself possessed <a href='Medium-Prague-IAPSOP-.html'>medium</a>istic talents, was persuaded to become a part-time professional <a href='Medium-Prague-IAPSOP-.html'>medium</a>. What may have been his first apport appeared at this time: a stone dripping with sea water said to have been conveyed directly from the ocean.1 &nbsp;Bailey was paid for this activity, a welcome addition to his otherwise meagre earnings.<br>
<br>
During a séance in 1898, his ‘spirit-control’ concurred with a sitter about an ailment that the sitter complained of, which the sitter had in fact made up. He was a police officer, who subsequently had him prosecuted and fined for fraud.<br>
<br>
In the 1890s he was noticed by a wealthy American businessman, Thomas Welton Stanford, whose brother had founded Stanford University in California. Welton, a devoted Spiritualist, donated a large sum of money to establish <a href='Psychical-Research.html'>psychical research</a> at the university. In 1902, Bailey held a séance at Stanford’s home and impressed him with abundant ‘showers’ of metal falling from the ceiling in the darkened room.2 For twelve years thereafter he gave regular séances under Stanford’s patronage; these were documented and later given to Stanford University, along with the apports that had been produced at the time. Much of the collection was destroyed by an earthquake in 1906.  Phenomena and Investigations<br>
<br>
Bailey’s ‘spirit controls’ were said to include ‘Dr Robinson’ (a deceased theological literary academic)3 and other deceased scholars. Their discourses entertained sitters, but it was the apports that caused special interest. These included:   	live fish 	large quantities of seaweed and sand with aquatic fauna 	a fishing net 	a live turtle 	exotic plants 	ivory 	beads and precious stones 	foreign and ancient coins 	a human skull 	a leopard skin 	a large piece of tapestry<br>
<br>
Clay tablets and cylinders also appeared, inscribed with what looked like ancient Babylonian inscriptions.4 In 1905, a sample of these was submitted to the British Museum, which judged them to be forgeries.5 This did not diminish Bailey’s standing with his audiences, many of whom agreed with the assessment of Sir <a href='Arthur-Conan-Doyle-Psi-Encyclopedia.html'>Arthur Conan Doyle</a> that the spirits had created the objects themselves rather than disturb archeological sites.6<br>
<br>
Harbinger of <a href='Light-IAPSOP-.html'>Light</a>, an <a href='Australian-Spiritualist-IAPSOP-.html'>Australian spiritualist</a> magazine, gave increasing prominence to Bailey’s apports and published photographs of them. In 1903, Bailey agreed to a request by Dr Charles MacCarthy from Sydney to submit to investigation. This was carried out in a room and with sitters chosen by MacCarthy. Bailey was searched and enclosed in a canvas bag with only his head and hands protruding. In the first sitting there were no apports. In subsequent sittings, fifty-four articles were apported, including ‘some inscribed clay tablets, small birds, coins, semi-precious stones, an Arabic newspaper, a crab, and a small barely alive shark’.7 Similar objects continued to appear even after Bailey was sealed behind a curtain of mosquito netting, including a three-foot long leopard-skin rug.8<br>
<br>
Further tests were carried out by AW Dobbie, a member of the British <a href='Society-for-Psychical-Research-Psi-Encyclopedia.html'>Society for Psychical Research</a>, with inconclusive results. Tests in Adelaide produced only small apports.<br>
<br>
In 1904, Bailey travelled to Italy at the invitation of the Milan <a href='Society-for-Psychical-Research-Psi-Encyclopedia.html'>Society for Psychical</a> Studies; reports of his activities were subsequently published in the journal <a href='Luce-e-Ombra-IAPSOP-.html'>Luce e Ombra</a>, and translated and published in Australia.9 Bailey now insisted on complete darkness and refused to undress for searches. Attempts to impose controls by tying him up had to be abandoned &nbsp;because of violent gestures and manoeuvres he made during the séances.<br>
<br>
In 1906, he again left Melbourne and went on tour throughout Europe and London, continuing to hold sittings under Stanford’s patronage. In one particularly dramatic séance in 1908, Bailey was said to transform his clothing into a Mandarin costume and speak in &nbsp;what appeared to be perfectly articulated Chinese.10<br>
<br>
A damaging exposure occurred in Grenoble when Albert de Rochas, a French <a href='Psychical-Research.html'>psychical research</a>er, visited a market where song birds were sold, to try to identify certain live birds that Bailey had supposedly apported. The seller identified Bailey as the person who had bought them from him earlier. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
In 1911, Bailey arrived in London to give private sittings (for a fee) and finally agreed to test séances under the super<a href='Vision-IAPSOP-.html'>vision</a> of <a href='The-Psychical-Research-Review-IAPSOP-.html'>the psychical research</a>ers <a href='Everard-Feilding-Psi-Encyclopedia.html'>Everard Feilding</a> and William Wortley Baggally, and the conjurer William Marriott. Bailey refused to be ‘surgically’ searched; the sacking he had been enclosed in was found to have a small hole in it and to contain some bird feathers, raising suspicions that birds had been earlier placed there. Baggally later concluded that Bailey hid his ‘apports’ in his clothing.11<br>
<br>
Bailey left London for Scotland where, at the invitation of James Coates, he undertook private sittings, for which he was well paid.12<br>
<br>
Further embarrassments followed Bailey’s return to Australia. In one case, a slate reading trick failed to work; in another, he was accused of faking apparitions. By this time Bailey had broken with Stanford and was being threatened with an investigation by Dr John Coover, a <a href='Psychical-Research.html'>psychical research</a>er at Stanford University, aimed at exposing him. Bailey left the country and returned to Scotland.<br>
<br>
Bailey may have worked in England under the name of PS Mills-Tanner, although this is uncertain.13 &nbsp;By 1920 he was back in Australia, having won support from Sir <a href='Arthur-Conan-Doyle-Psi-Encyclopedia.html'>Arthur Conan Doyle</a>, but now took little part in spiritualist circles. He married aged seventy-six, died the following year and was cremated in Sydney.  Commentary and Criticism<br>
<br>
Bailey has been acclaimed by some as the world’s greatest apport <a href='Medium-Prague-IAPSOP-.html'>medium</a>’ and as ‘the greatest <a href='Medium-Prague-IAPSOP-.html'>medium</a> of this age’,14 and by others as an innovative and successful faker.15<br>
<br>
Sceptics pointed to weak controls and other conditions that could have enabled him to deceive audiences and investigators:   	he was usually aware of the séance room’s layout 	séances were held in near or total darkness 	sitters may have acted as stooges 	he was not searched properly and may have concealed items in his clothing or body orifices 	the materials he was enclosed in were sometimes found to have been torn 	the ties around his neck and hands may have been poorly fastened, allowing him to escape their constraints 	he took advantage of Stanford’s naivety<br>
<br>
Supporters argue the number, size and nature of many of the objects that appeared in investigative séances in controlled conditions would have been extremely challenging to fake, even if the controls had been imperfect.<br>
